You've made it clear that SCSI_PROC_FS is important for several classes
of hardware.

You worry that changing the Kconfig default would force distro maintainers
(we are talking about Debian/Redhat/Suse/etc right?) to actually turn the
feature on, instead of relying on the "default y" behavior (as they have
done in the past).

How likely is it that distro kernels would *not* enable CHR_DEV_SG?
(Distros tend to enable everything, and then some.)

CHR_DEV_SG is enabled in the default configs for i386 and x86_64:

$ git grep CHR_DEV_SG arch/x86/configs/
arch/x86/configs/i386_defconfig:CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=y
arch/x86/configs/x86_64_defconfig:CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=y

=> As soon as CHR_DEV_SG is enabled, SCSI_PROC_FS is also enabled.

(I work on smaller systems where we do use /proc occasionally, but we
don't enable CHR_DEV_SG or SCSI_PROC_FS.)

I think we just need to find a reasonable condition for enabling
SCSI_PROC_FS by default on "your" sytems, and not on "mine" ;-)

Regards.
