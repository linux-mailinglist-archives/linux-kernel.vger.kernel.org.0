Because the panel that comes with the Teres-I is always the
same. However, that's not true for all the devices out there using the
bridge, starting with the pinebook.

Again, that may be the case on the Teres-I, but not necessarily on
other boards.

That's not really the outcome of the discussion we had here though:

Depending on the outcome of the discussion above, yes or no :)
