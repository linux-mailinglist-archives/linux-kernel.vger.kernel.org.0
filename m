To be more precise, I recommended an subsection_active_map, to indicate=20
which memmaps were fully initialized and can safely be touched (e.g., to=20
read the zone/nid). This map would also be set when the devmem memmaps=20
were initialized (race between adding memory/growing the section and=20
initializing the memmap).

See

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/10/87

and

https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-driver-devel/msg130012.html

I dislike a map that is specific to ZONE_DEVICE or (currently)=20
!ZONE_DEVICE. I rather want an indication "this memmap is safe to=20
touch". As discussed along the mentioned threads, we can combine this=20
later with RCU to handle some races that are currently possible.

--=20
