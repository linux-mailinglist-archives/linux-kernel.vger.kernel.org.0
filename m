The topic comes up once in a while. Making a set of regmap clk_ops and
structures might work to consolidate the code across the different
drivers. I can't recall why we didn't combine the two implementations at
that point. I do remember that Mike was opposed to pushing it directly
into the core framework as part of struct clk_hw out of fear of bloating
the clk_hw structure.

I don't particularly like how the meson implementation makes every clk
the same type and has a 'data' member of clk_regmap to differentiate the
types (mux, gate, div, etc.) It avoids nesting structures but otherwise
serves the same purpose as having there be container structures for the
different types that all have a clk_regmap structure inside. qcom
implementation also takes a shortcut and adds enable/disable logic into
the clk_regmap structure. To consolidate the two I imagine we would need
to change both implementations to use a struct like:

	struct clk_regmap {
		struct clk_hw hw;
		struct regmap *map;
	};
