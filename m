OK, thanks. RockPro64 uses RK3399 and RK808D.
Is there such a soft-reset for GRF_IO_VSEL in RK3399?

DDR Version 1.23 20190709
[boot loop]

What we can see here:
The ROM bootloader is able to access the SD card after reboot, it loads
and starts the DDR config firmware without any problem. The DDR firmware
runs through and loads and starts the miniloader without any problem.
The miniloader then tries to find RKTRUST on SPI (empty on my board),
eMMC (not populated) and SD card and fails to access the SD card
properly, if this card is configured for UHS mode. (With SD card at HS
not UHS configuration the miniloader just loads and starts ATF, TEE and
u-boot without any problem.)

So in principle the UHS configured SD card can be accessed after reboot
without any problem. At least ROM bootloader and DDR firmware do so. The
miniloader seems to do something differently and therefore fails.
Shawn, any idea what's going on there?
