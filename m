Agreed, hopefully checkpatch is up to date enough to catch these.

Correct.

Not correct.

Documentation can always be updated, a patch to make it clearer is
always appreciated.  But look at what we have today in the document, I
think it should be pretty obvious that:
	/* SPDX... */
is the thing to use for C header files.

If you disagree, that's fine, please send a patch to make it clearer and
we can all review it.
