Yes, I understood.  You are able to lower the voltage supplied to the
controller itself, not to the card.  ...but that is not something that
all SoCs can do.  I think here you are arguing that your feature is
useful to everyone--even if they can't ever lower the voltage of the
controller.  I am questioning that.

It doesn't matter if you've got a long playback.  A properly tuned
"race to idle" should still be better unless you are seriously saving
a lot of power by never bringing the voltage up.  The above example is
with a fixed size transfer, but just imagine the same thing over and
over again and you've got the video playback case.

You have to make sure that you are proactively gating the card clock
in conjunction.  If you aren't gating the card clock quickly enough
(and aren't lowering the controller voltage when the card clock is
gated) then you won't notice the savings.

Thanks, I think this is critical for the discussion.  Please make sure
that when you are gating you code it up in a way that you can remove
the vote for the higher controller voltage.

If you're only testing video playback then I guess you don't care so
much here.  I was assuming you cared about video record too, but maybe
that's not such an important use case for saving power.

You should be able to remove your vote whenever the card clock is
gated.  Maybe this is what you're missing?
