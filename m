We really do still need the emergency case, in this case for when
kzalloc() returns NULL.  Which does indeed mean an rcu_head in the thing
being freed.  Otherwise, you end up with an out-of-memory deadlock where
you could free memory only if you had memor to allocate.

But we really do still need to handle the case where everything runs out,
even the pre-allocated pages.
