Can we rely on GFP_ATOMIC allocations for these? These have emergency memory
pools which are reserved.

I was thinking a 2 fold approach (just thinking out loud..):

If kfree_call_rcu() is called in atomic context or in any rcu reader, then
use GFP_ATOMIC to grow an rcu_head wrapper on the atomic memory pool and
queue that.

Otherwise, grow an rcu_head on the stack of kfree_call_rcu() and call
synchronize_rcu() inline with it.

Use preemptible() andr task_struct's rcu_read_lock_nesting to differentiate
between the 2 cases.

Thoughts?

If *everything* runs out, you are pretty much going to OOM sooner or later
anyway :D. But I see what you mean. But the 'tradeoff' is RCU can free
head-less objects where possible.
