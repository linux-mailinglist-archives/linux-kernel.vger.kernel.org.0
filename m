When the stop machine finishes it will do a wake_up_process() via
complete().  Since this does not pass WF_LOCK_SLEEPER, saved_state will be
cleared, and you'll have TASK_RUNNING when you get to other_func() and
schedule(), regardless of whether CPU1 sends wake_up() -- so this change
doesn't actually accomplish anything.

While as noted in the other thread I don't think these spurious wakeups are
a huge problem, we could avoid them by doing stop_one_cpu_nowait() and then
schedule() without messing with task state.  Since we're stopping our own
cpu, it should be guaranteed that the stopper has finished by the time we
exit schedule().
