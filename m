I double-checked. On the Teres-I, mentioning the panel _is_ optional.
PD23 powers down panel and backlight as much as possible, see
24bd5d2cb93bc arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: teres-i: enable backlight
(currently only in Maxime's repo) and the Teres-I schematics...

And the driver in your repo neatly guards all accesses with
"if (anx6345->panel)" -- good!
But I found the Vdds are required, so I added them as such.

*I* have one, and this works. I'll retest with your newer driver,
just in case. Nonetheless, the changes in this series should be fine.
Sending out v2 in a moment...
