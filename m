Think so, yes.

I think checking for this register is the better approach. Then i could drop the
cnt variable. And by droppting cnt i would propose to move the check and reenabling
to the end of the while loop to reenable the channel after freeing first buffer.

Could memory and compiler ordering a problem here?
I'm not that into these kind of problems, but is this
	sdmac->flags &= ~IMX_DMA_ACTIVE;
  	writel_relaxed(BIT(channel), sdma->regs + SDMA_H_STATSTOP);
guaranteed to be free of race conditions?
