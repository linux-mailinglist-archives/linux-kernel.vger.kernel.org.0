This is another point I think current code is not working well. And actually,
the behavior is not well defined or our kernel is broken for a while.

When you look at the man page, it says:

    RETURN VALUE
           On success move_pages() returns zero.  On error, it returns -1, and sets errno to indicate the error

So per my understanding, the design is to return -1 on error instead of the
pages not managed to move.

For the user interface, if original code check 0 for success, your change
breaks it. Because your code would return 1 instead of 0. Suppose most user
just read the man page for programming instead of reading the kernel source
code. I believe we need to fix it.

Not sure how to include some user interface related developer to look into
this issue. Hope this thread may catch their eyes.
