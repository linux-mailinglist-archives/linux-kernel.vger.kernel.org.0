Yes, we should get that for DT now thanks to the of_devlink stuff, but 
cooking up some equivalent for IORT might be worthwhile.

Bleh - further reinforcement of the "ideas after 6PM are bad ideas" rule...

Of course, just adding a 'correct' add_device replay without the 
of_xlate process doesn't help at all. No wonder this looked suspiciously 
simpler than where the first idea left off...

(on reflection, the core of this idea seems to be recycling the existing 
iommu_bus_init walk rather than building up a separate "waiting list", 
while forgetting that that wasn't the difficult part of the original 
idea anyway)

Yes, iommu_bus_init() is one of the places still holding a 
deeply-ingrained assumption that the ops go live for all IOMMU instances 
at once, which is what warranted the further replay in 
of_iommu_configure() originally. Moving that out of 
of_platform_device_create() to support probe deferral is where the 
trouble really started.
