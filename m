I may still be missing something, but if the fixup code (AFAIU the code performing
the out-of-line single-stepping of the original instruction) belongs to a section
hidden from instrumentation, it should not be an issue.

The basic idea would be, e.g. pseudo-code for int3:

<int3>  <---- in section which cannot be instrumented
if (recursion_ctx->in_tracer) {
   single-step original instruction
   iret
}
[...] prepare stuff
recursion_ctx->in_tracer = true;
instr_allowed()

call external kernel functions (which can be instrumented)

instr_disallowed()
recursion_ctx->in_tracer = false;
single-step original instruction
iret

The purpose of the "in_tracer" flag is to protect whatever is done within external
kernel functions (which can be instrumented) from triggering tracer recursion. It
needs to be combined with hiding of early/late low-level entry/exit functions from
instrumentation (as you propose) to work.

Thanks,

Mathieu
