A patch set containing direct LSM changes should consider all LSMs.
This will allow all the LSM maintainers to consider the changes. Now we
have a limited audience and we are favoring one LSM.

There is no good reason why direct LSM changes cannot be done
post-upstreaming like we do for virtualization.

Looking at Sean's patches, overally 1/5-3/5 make perfect sense.
