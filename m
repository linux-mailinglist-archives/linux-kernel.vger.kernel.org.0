We gain a lot, even though it's just for testing. For one thing, once
the patch is upstream, all syzbot instances that target upstream-ish
branches will start fuzzing USB, and there won't be any need for me to
maintain a dedicated USB fuzzing branch manually. Another thing, is
that syzbot will be able to do fix/cause bisection (at least for the
bugs that are fixed/introduced after this patch is merged). And
finally, once this is upstream, we'll be able to backport this to
Android kernels and start testing them as well.

What do you mean by supporting set_alt() here? AFAIU set_alt() is a
part of the composite gadget framework, which I don't use for this.
Are there some other actions (besides sending/receiving requests) that
need to be exposed to userspace to implement various USB classes? The
one that I know about is halting endpoints, it's mentioned in the TODO
section in documentation.

This sounds good to me. Let's concentrate on implementing the part
that is essential for testing/fuzzing, as it was the initial reason
why I started working on this, instead of using e.g. GadgetFS. I'll
add such IOCTL in v6.

Re GFP_ATOMIC allocations, if we're using the blocking approach,
should I decrease the limit of the number of such allocations or do
something else?

Re licensing comments, do I need to change anything after all?
