It's documented behaviour that is upstream for 9 years. Why is your workload
special?

The documentation suggests to use smaps if you want to have precise data.
Why would it not fly for you?

The original commit 34e55232e59f ("mm: avoid false sharing of mm_counter")
shows numbers on cache misses. It's not a real world workload, but you
don't have any numbers at all to back your claim.

Keeping stats precise is welcome, but often expensive. It might be
negligible for small machine, but becomes a problem on multisocket
machine with dozens or hundreds of cores. We need to keep kernel scalable.

We have other stats that update asynchronously (i.e. /proc/vmstat). Would
you like to convert them too?
