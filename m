a) the particular CoW page might be cold enough to be reclaimed and b)
nothing really prevents the MADV_PAGEOUT to be called faster than the
reference bit being readded.

Well, I have to admit that I haven't seen any actual numbers here but
considering zygote like workload I would rather not even risk it. Even
if the risk is theoretical I would rather put the restriction and
mention it in the changelog. If somebody would like to drop this
restriction it is at least more clear what to test for.
