Would there be harm then in simply storing:

  ktime_get_ns() + idle_state->exit_latency_ns

(which is u64)?

Thanks for the link!

So while we (should) have the relevant barriers, there can still be
concurrent writing (from the CPU entering/leaving idle) and reading
(from the CPU gathering stats).

rcu_dereference() gives you READ_ONCE(), and the rcu_assign_pointer()
should give you an smp_store_release(). What I'm thinking here is, if we
have reasons not to use the RCU primitives, we should at least slap some
READ/WRITE_ONCE() to the accesses. Also, can RCU even do anything about
scalar values like the break even you're storing?
