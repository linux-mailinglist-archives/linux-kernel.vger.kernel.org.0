See discussions previous versions of this patch.  Specifically you can
see v4 at <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10875505/> and v3
(posted by Sean) at <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10207591/>.

Specifically: According to Rob H it is generally not required to
validate what's in device tree--it can be just blindly applied.  Thus
the bindings shouldn't really say anything about trying to reconcile
with the driver (especially since that's heavily relying on the
current driver implementation).

At the moment the driver still does validate things and we could
discuss removing that in a future patchset if it was deemed important
/ desirable.

One thing to think about here is that the bindings are a bit divorced
from the real world.  Specifically the bindings should describe
hardware / what's possible and it's OK for bindings to describe things
that aren't yet supported in code.  You've gotta be really careful
here, of course, because it's easy to write ridiculous bindings if
there is no implementation backing them up, but in general that's
supposed to be the idea.

Here it seems like it should be possible to specify timings as a range
and that would be a sensible thing to do.  ...and we're already using
existing code to parse this node, specifically
of_get_display_timing().  If simple-panel can't (yet) handle
reconciling ranges specified in DT then presumably we shouldn't rely
on that yet.  ...but if it becomes useful then we can add it later.
...but it's OK to already have it in the bindings.

Did that make sense?  If I'm misunderstanding something about the
situation then please yell!  :-)

I will also note that perhaps we shouldn't nit-pick too much as per
Rob's comment in the cover letter [1] of v5 of the series.
Specifically he said this binding is going away anyway.

Summary: I think I have no actions here and this could go to drm-misc
with Theirry's Ack plus other tags.
