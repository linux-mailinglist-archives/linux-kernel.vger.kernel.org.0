Subject: [PATCH v3 0/6] soundwire: update ASoC interfaces

We need new fields in existing structures to
a) deal with race conditions on codec probe/enumeration
b) allow for multi-step ACPI scan/probe/startup on Intel plaforms

These structures will be used by the SOF driver as well as codec
drivers.

To avoid conflicts between ASoC and Soundwire trees, these 6 patches
are provided out-of-order, before the functionality enabled in these
header files is added in follow-up patch series which can be applied
separately in the ASoC and Soundwire trees. As discussed earlier,
Vinod would need to provide an immutable tag for Mark Brown, and the
integration on the ASoC side of SOF changes and new codecs drivers can
proceed in parallel with SoundWire core changes.

Note that the SOF changes are not provided as a v3 today due to
conflicts with other in-flight SOF cleanups to facilitate support for
Device Tree devices. Those changes don't impact the interface
definition suggested here but the machine driver detection for
SoundWire. The changes should be ready in next week.

The mapping between the patches in this series and follow-up ones
shouldn't give anyone a migraine:

soundwire: sdw_slave: add probe_complete structure and new fields
soundwire: bus: fix race condition with probe_complete signaling

soundwire: sdw_slave: add enumeration_complete structure
soundwire: bus: fix race condition with enumeration_complete signaling

soundwire: sdw_slave: add initialization_complete definition
soundwire: bus: fix race condition with initialization_complete signaling

soundwire: sdw_slave: track unattach_request to handle all init sequences
soundwire: bus: fix race condition by tracking UNATTACHED transition

Changes since v2:
Added new field to deal with a race condition leading to a timeout
when the codec goes through a pm_runtime suspend/resume transition
while the Master remains active.
Clarified commit messages with detailed explanations what those race
conditions are and why the changes were introduced.
Reordered fields for Intel routines
Added kernel-doc definitions for structures
Modified the patch subjects to make the mapping between interface definition
and implementation straightforward.

Changes since v1 (no feedback received since October 23)
additional initialization_complete utility to help codec drivers with
their resume operation, waiting for the enumeration to complete is not
always enough.
