That is a check for the enable-method, not entry-method.

We don't check for entry-method anywhere, AFAICT.

entry-method is not read in Linux code (see above).

Only enable-method is checked.

That is a fair point. But in those cases, the binding is probably used
by another OS. entry-method seems to an example of one that isn't used
by Linux or other OSes.
