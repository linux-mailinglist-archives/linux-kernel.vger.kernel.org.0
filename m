This is already fixed in the ext4.git tree; it will be pushed to Linus
shortly.  (Thanks to Colin Ian King from Canonical for sending the
patch.)

Lee, techncially this should have been Reviewed-by.  Acked-by is used
by the maintainer when a patch is going in via some other tree other
than the Maintainer's (it means the Maintainer has acked the patch).
If you are reviewing a patch, the tag you should be adding is
Reviewed-by.

Cheers,
