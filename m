It doesn't fix my problem. tty0 remains the default console instead
of ttyS0 with your patch applied.

I suspect for the same reason, we match uart0 which isn't preferred,
so we enable that but don't put it "first" in the list, and since
we break out of the loop we never match ttyS0.

I see 3 simple ways out of this that don't involve breaking up match()

 - Bite the bullet and use my patch assuming that calling setup()
multiple times is safe. I had a look at the two you had concerns
with, the zilog ones seems safe. pl1011 will leak a clk_prepare
reference but I think that's a non-issue for a kernel console
(I may be wrong)

 - Rework the loop to try matching against the array entry pointed
by preferred_console first.

 - Rework the loop to try matching the entries from the command line
before trying to match the entries added by the platform/arch.
(Easily done by flagging them in the array, I can cook a patch).

Let me know what you prefer or if you have a different idea and
I'll try to whip up a patch tomorrow.

Cheers,
Ben.
