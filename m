Idle states and other power management features are a known source of latency.
This latency changes across hardware all the time and RT people are accustomed
to test against this.

Android has a wakelock which AFAIR disabled deep sleep because on some sections
the wakeup latency can hinder throughput for some apps. So it's a known problem
outside RT universe too.

It's consistent and deterministic unlike the current situation of it depends on
your luck. What you get across boots/runs is completely random and this is
worse than what this patch offers.

The default for Linux has always been putting the system at the highest
performance point by default. And this translates to the biggest CPU at
the highest frequency. It's not ideal but consistent. This doesn't prevent
people from tweaking their systems to get what they want.

Without this patch there's no way for an RT task to guarantee a minimum
performance requirement.

I don't think there's a change of the default behavior because without this
patch we could still end up on a big CPU.

And you're stating that the difference between wakeup time in big cores and
little cores is a problem. And as I stated several times this is a known source
of latency that changes across systems and if somebody cares about idle state
latencies then they probably looking at something beyond generic systems and
need to tune it to guarantee a deterministic low latency behavior.

I still don't see any proposed alternative to what should be the default
behavior.
