This looks quite similar to the refactoring proposed earlier by Stephan 
Müller in his paper: https://www.chronox.de/lrng/doc/lrng.pdf . Indeed, 
he makes a good argument that the timing of device interrupts is right 
now the main actual source of entropy in Linux, at the end of Section 1.1:

"""
The discussion shows that the noise sources of block devices and HIDs 
are a derivative of the interrupt noise source. All events used as 
entropy source recorded by the block device and HID noise source are 
delivered to the Linux kernel via interrupts.
"""

Now your patch adds the timer interrupt (while the schedule() loop is 
running) to the mix, essentially in the same setup as proposed.
