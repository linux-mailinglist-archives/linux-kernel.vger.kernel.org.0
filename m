Hi Dan,

Just to make sure I understand correctly are you saying you still have
the screaming interrupt with the flag commit reverted, or that it is
polling instead of using interrupts [2]? Was that testing with both
commits reverted, or just the flag commit?  What kernel were you
running before you saw the issue with 5.3 stable?  On that kernel you
weren't seeing the polling message, and interrupts were working?  Are
you able to boot a 5.0 kernel on the system? It would be interesting
to see how it was behaving before the power gating changes. I think it
would be using polling due to how the code behaves because of that
flag. It looks like without the flag being enabled by Stefan's commit
TPM_GLOBAL_INT_ENABLE will never get cleared because tpm_tis_probe_irq_single
expects tpm_tis_send to clear it if there is a problem, and without the
flag being set that whole section of code is skipped.

Unfortunately I'm having no luck tracking down a system where I can actually
test and debug this interrupt code.

Reverting the following commits should get you to a point where it is using
polling at least. This will bring back Christian's problem with tpm_get_timeouts
failing, but that can be solved with wrapping that with tpm_chip_start/tpm_chip_stop.
Christian, were you having any issues with interrupts? You system was going into
this code as well.

Jarkko, another problem has been reported that appears to have shown up around the time of the gating changes:

[    4.098104] tpm_tis MSFT0101:00: 2.0 TPM (device-id 0xFE, rev-id 2)
[    5.138572] ima: Error Communicating to TPM chip
[    5.143727] ima: Error Communicating to TPM chip

[    5.169517] ima: Error Communicating to TPM chip
[    5.174673] ima: Error Communicating to TPM chip

I've located a system where it occurs, so I'll try to bisect and figure out what is going wrong.

Regards,
Jerry
