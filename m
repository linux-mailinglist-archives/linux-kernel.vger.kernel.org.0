First, disturbing nohz_full CPUs can be avoided by the sysadm simply
refusing to remove tracepoints while sensitive applications are running
on nohz_full CPUs.

Second, for non-CPU-bound real-time programs with mostly-idle CPUs,
I should be able to decrease the likelihood of sending IPIs pretty much
to zero.

Or am I missing something here?
