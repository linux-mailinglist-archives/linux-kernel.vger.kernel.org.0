There is a big difference between allowing page faults to happen, and expecting
page faults to happen every time. I suspect many use-cases will end up having
a fast-path which touches user-space data which is in the page cache, but
may end up triggering page faults in rare occasions.

Therefore, this might justify an SRCU which has low-overhead read-side.

Thanks,

Mathieu
