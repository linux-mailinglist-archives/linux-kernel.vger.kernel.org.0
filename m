I've been busy trying to get some perf numbers on arm64 server~ish systems,
I finally managed to get some specjbb numbers on TX2 (the 2 nodes, 224
CPUs version which I suspect is the same as you used in the above). I only
have a limited number of iterations (5, although each runs for about 2h)
because I wanted to get some (usable) results by today, I'll spin some more
during the week.


This is based on the "critical-jOPs" metric which AFAIU higher is better:

Baseline, SMTOFF:
  mean     12156.400000
  std        660.640068
  min      11016.000000
  25%      12158.000000
  50%      12464.000000
  75%      12521.000000
  max      12623.000000

Patches (+ find_idlest_group() fixup), SMTOFF:
  mean     12487.250000
  std        184.404221
  min      12326.000000
  25%      12349.250000
  50%      12449.500000
  75%      12587.500000
  max      12724.000000


It looks slightly better overall (mean, stddev), but I'm annoyed by that
low iteration count. I also had some issues with my SMTON run and I only
got numbers for 2 iterations, so I'll respin that before complaining.

FWIW the branch I've been using is:
