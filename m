Sigh, either variant is somehow confusing.

I think that -ENOENT is a bit better than -EIO. It is abbreviation of
"No entry or No entity" which quite fits here. Also the device might
exist but it is not used when not requested.

I do not mind about -EFAULT vs -EIO. Well, -EIO might actually
better describe the reality.

That said, I do not want to spend much time on bikesheding. Feel free
to use whatever looks better to you.

Great catch! There is still a lot to learn about this code.

It seems that, for example, pstore and netconsole are not added
into console_cmdline and do not match. They relly on the explicitely
set CON_ENABLED.

I would prefer to hide this into the new "shorter" function. I would
rename it to try_enable_new_console() and add the following at the end:

	/*
	 * For example, pstore, netconsole, are enabled even
	 * without matching.
	 */
	if (console->flags & CON_ENABLED)
		return 0;

Best Regards,
Petr
