First, what if the memory pressure comes from memory.high/max set on A?

Second, it's up to semantics we define. Looking at it from the other side:
there is clearly 1G of memory in C which is not protected no matter what.
B wants it's memory to be fully protected, but it's limited by the competit=
ion
on the parent level. Now we try to satisfy B's requirements until we can.
Should we treat B and C equally from scratch?

I think both approaches is acceptable, but if we're switching from one opti=
on
to another, let's make it clear.

I do not disagree: the introduction of the proportional reclaim
made this complication (partially?) obsolete. But originally it was
required to make target distribution correct.

Absolutely, I'm not against the change. I just want to make sure we will
put all details into the changelog.

Thanks!
