I mean that partial power down in the currently upstream driver
doesn't work.  AKA: if I turn on partial power down in the upstream
driver then hotplug events break.  I can try to provide some logs.  On
what exact version of the code do you want logs?  Just your series?
Just my series?  Mainline?  Some attempt at combining both series?  As
I said things seem to sorta work with the combined series.  I can try
to clarify if that's the series you want me to test with.  ...or I can
wait for your next version?

I am by no means an expert on dwc2, but an assumption made in my patch
is that even cores that can't support partial power down can still
save some amount of power when hcd_suspend is called.

Some evidence that this should be possible: looking at mainline Linux
and at dwc2_port_suspend(), I see:

* It is currently called even when we have DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE

* It currently sets HPRT0_SUSP

* It currently sets PCGCTL_STOPPCLK specifically in the case where
power down is DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE.

...I believe that the net effect of my patch ends up doing both those
same two things in hcd_suspend.  That is: when power_down is
DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE I believe my patch is really just doing the
same thing that dwc2_port_suspend() would do in the same case.  Is
that not OK?

Yeah, we can debate about how to best share/split code.  I'm not in
love with the current structure either.  When I rebased your patches
atop mine I changed this to more fully split them and I agree that was
better.

Can you explain what HAPS-DX is?
