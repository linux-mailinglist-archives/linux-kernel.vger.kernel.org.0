So we already had a discussion on this here:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10925861/

(Sounds like I should have probably documented that :-))

However, I am sympathetic to your argument. I was thinking that it
might be good to make get_maintainer suggest CC'ing kunit-dev@ and
linux-kselftest@ for all new tests and this would be hard with the
*-test.c naming scheme.

If we are going to change it, now is probably the time to do it :-)

I had generally been following the pattern:

foo.c
struct foo_bar {};
int foo_baz() {}
foo-test.c
struct foo_test_buzz {};
void foo_test_does_foo_baz_buzz(struct kunit *test) {}

However, now that you point that out I am realizing there is a bunch
of stuff here that is not consistent with that (whoops, sorry for not
catching that earlier, David).

Nevertheless, I think the list_test_struct is fine and conforms to the pattern.

Yeah, that is a good point, but I don't think entirely relevant to
this code review.

Fundamentally it boils down to figuring out what your API is, and
coming up with a way to expose it. For drivers, that means finding a
way to give KUnit access to the generated driver objects, in some
cases it means using more dependency injection, in other cases it may
mean making something that is static, not static.

I know those answers sound pretty unsatisfying, and I have some
features planned which alleviate some of those issues, but I think the
most important thing is making examples of how to deal with some of
the broad cases, getting agreement on them, documenting them, finding
exceptions and iterating.

Nevertheless, if you want to start enumerating cases and proposed
solutions, I would be more than happy to have that conversation now,
but we might want to fork the discussion.

Cheers!
