Subject: [PATCH v4 04/10] lib/refcount: Move bulk of REFCOUNT_FULL implementation into header
Date:   Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:30:29 +0000
Message-Id: <20191030143035.19440-5-will@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.20.1
In-Reply-To: <20191030143035.19440-1-will@kernel.org>
References: <20191030143035.19440-1-will@kernel.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In an effort to improve performance of the REFCOUNT_FULL implementation,
move the bulk of its functions into linux/refcount.h. This allows them
to be inlined in the same way as if they had been provided via
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_REFCOUNT.
