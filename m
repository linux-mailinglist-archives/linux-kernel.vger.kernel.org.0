Hi Rob,
For now we have two options.
1. reusing the existing "maximum-speed" which is documented in usb/generic.txt
Pro: no need to add new property
Con: only "super-speed" and "super-speed-plus" are valid for Tegra XUSB PADCTL,
therefore extra code/document change is required.

+	if (device_property_present(&port->dev, "maximum-speed")) {
+		maximum_speed =  usb_get_maximum_speed(&port->dev);
+		if (maximum_speed == USB_SPEED_SUPER)
+			usb3->disable_gen2 = true;
+		else if (maximum_speed == USB_SPEED_SUPER_PLUS)
+			usb3->disable_gen2 = false;
+		else
+			return -EINVAL;
+	}

2. introducing a new proprietary "nvidia,disable-gen2" property
Pro: its logic perfectly matches the need, and code change is minimum

+        usb3->disable_gen2 = of_property_read_bool(np, "nvidia,disable-gen2");

Con: it's a new and proprietary property.

Please let me know which one do you prefer or there is something else works better.

Thanks,
JC
