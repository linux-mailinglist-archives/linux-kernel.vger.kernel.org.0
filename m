I'm not sure why, this is API between kernel and the user space.

There are many uuid libraries, which  is the one that provides the uuid type
between kernel and the user space?

I do not recall be part of this conversation, please share the link.

Is wrong how... ?  What is broken in the concept ? Please give me an example of what is going to wrong, here. 
Just saying that something is wrong is not convincing.

But API is already out there, do you plan to remove it?

I can but do you know all the software that includes <linux/uuid.h> ?
Thanks
