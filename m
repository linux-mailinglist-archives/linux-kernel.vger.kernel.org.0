This problem doesn't exist because userspace is passing the memory, not
the other way around.

This is coming from struct tm, it is part of C89 but I think I was not
born when this decision was made. man rtc properly reports that those
fields are unused and no userspace tools are actually making use of
them. Nobody cares about the broken down representation of the time.
What is done is use the ioctl then mktime to have a UNIX timestamp.

"The mktime function ignores the specified contents of the tm_wday,
tm_yday, tm_gmtoff, and tm_zone members of the broken-down time
structure. It uses the values of the other components to determine the
calendar time; itâ€™s permissible for these components to have
unnormalized values outside their normal ranges. The last thing that
mktime does is adjust the components of the brokentime structure,
including the members that were initially ignored."
