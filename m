Current perf only support per-core Topdown RDPMC. On Icelake, it can be 
extended to per-thread Topdown RDPMC.
It tries to explain the extra work for per-thread topdown RDPMC, e.g. 
save/restore slots and metrics value in context switch.

It will return the value of PERF_METRICS. I will add it in the changelog.
