Yes. You have to have some sort of frequency table to tell us what the
source and predivider to use.

Ouch!

Please have a frequency table like

 { .src =3D SOME_PLL, .div =3D 4 }

Why isn't rcg_ops doing it? The idea is to copy whatever is happening
with this snippet in the _freq_tbl_determine_rate() in rcg.c to rcg2.c

	clk_flags =3D clk_hw_get_flags(hw);
	p =3D clk_hw_get_parent_by_index(hw, index);
	if (clk_flags & CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT) {
		rate =3D rate * f->pre_div;

We have checked for CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT from the beginning. Maybe it was
always broken! If the frequency table pointer can return us the pre div
and source then we can do math to ask the parent PLL for something.

Please make rcg2 clk ops "do the right thing" when the flag
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT is set and the frequency table is just a
source/divider sort of thing. That way we don't have to have different
clk ops or even put anything in the frequency table besides the source
PLL we want to use and the predivider we want to configure.
