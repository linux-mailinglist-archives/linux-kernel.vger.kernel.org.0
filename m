Thanks for testing this.  This is not a surprise, you would either have
to have a broken processor like the one I'm using, or you would have to
have a migration occur on the instruction being single-stepped, which
would be extremely unlikely.

Since I've already gained some experience here, I'll try to look at
fixing things here for ARM64.
