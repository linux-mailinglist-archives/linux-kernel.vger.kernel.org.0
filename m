That's not correct.

The swap partition (or file) used by s2disk needs to be made active
before it can use it and the mm subsystem is also able to use it for
regular swap then.

Well, the entire contents of RAM must be preserved, this way or
another, during hibernation.  That should be totally obvious to anyone
using it really.

Some of the RAM contents is copies of data already there in the
filesystems on persistent storage and that does not need to be saved
again.  Everything else must be saved and s2disk (and Linux
hibernation in general) uses active swap space to save these things.
This implies that in order to hibernate the system, you generally need
the amount of swap space equal to the size of RAM minus the size of
files mapped into memory.

So, to be on the safe side, the total amount of swap space to be used
for hibernation needs to match the size of RAM (even though
realistically it may be smaller than that in the majority of cases).
