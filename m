You may have used a proportional font when writing this, the | doesn't
align with anything using a fixed font. Do I assume correctly that the
hardware multiplexer is actually a demultiplexer with one input and two
outputs ?

I think that's a better approach, at least at the DT level. The HDMI
demultiplexer should be represented as a DT node with 3 ports (one input
and two outputs) with a control GPIO.

From a video point of view, the ANX7688 should be represented as a DT
node with 2 ports (one input and one output), regardless of whether it
is used in conjunction with an HDMI switch as shown above, or directly
connected to the output of an HDMI encoder. However, as the ANX7688
supports both DP output and USB-C output, the situation may be slightly
more complex. Please see https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11184895/
for a similar discussion, related to the ANX7625.

In any case, I don't think the ANX7688 should care about the GPIO.
