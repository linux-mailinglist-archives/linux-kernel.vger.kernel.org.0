It's not exactly the same though. I suppose with the blsp_bam you only
see the actual data when the UART runs at the same speed as it's
counterpart. With a logic analyzer you can change the speed after
data capture, which might convert apparent garbage into reasonable
data.

In terms of data ss there difference between a string of zero bytes
and a single zero byte?

From my notes the response (vendor event) to a baudrate change
command on the WCN3990 is:

04 0e 04 01 00 00 00

The tail *might* be the zero(s) you are seeing, and the first part gets
lost for some reason?

A simplified version of the code in question:

  set_RTS(false)

  hci_set_baudrate(br)
  host_set_baudrate(br)

  msleep(50); // why is this needed???
  set_RTS(true)

  // supposedly wcn3990 now sends vendor event using the new baudrate

  wait_for_vendor_event()
    // ok with msleep, otherwise frame reassembly error


Maybe the MSM8998 UART (driver) currently needs the delay to fully switch to
the new baudrate? Perhaps the pinconfig still needs tweaking of some kind?

You said when you apply the full configuration used on cheza you don't
receive the response to the baudrate change command. Does it work when you
only configure the pull-up on the RX (host) pin?
