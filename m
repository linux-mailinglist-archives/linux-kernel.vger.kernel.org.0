The above kernel.* and init.* are merged into the legacy command line
before printing it out to dmesg. For boot-time tracing, yes, we need
/proc/bootconfig too.

Hm, at least "select BOOT_CONFIG" so that user can see this option is
there on menuconfig :)

Sorry, you might misunderstand that the bootconfig replaces legacy command
line. No, the legacy command line is still there and at least the part of
suppremental command line parts of bootconfig are merged into the command
line and shown in dmesg. So even if the user use bootconfig, their kernel
command line was just updated, they can grub it and simply paste on other
machine (if it accepts longer command line)

Thank you,
