I also agree. But this _FORCE thing will still not solve the issue Paul is
raising which is doing this loop possibly in irq disabled / hardirq context.
We can't even cond_resched() here. In fact since _FORCE is larger, it will be
even worse. Consider a real-time system with a lot of memory, in this case
letting ->head grow large is Ok, but looping for long time in IRQ disabled
would not be Ok.

But I could make it something like:
1. Letting ->head grow if ->head_free busy
2. If head_free is busy, then just queue/requeue the monitor to try again.

This would even improve performance, but will still risk going out of memory.

Thoughts?
