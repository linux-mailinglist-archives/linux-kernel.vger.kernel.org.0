Not in newer kernels, because the actual LDT is never modified.  Instead, LD=
T changes create a whole new LDT and propagate it with an IPI.

But the IRET path can fail due to changes to the selectors while in the kern=
el, due to sigreturn or ptrace.  We have delightful selftests for this.

Did you remember to test the #NP case?  Many kernels forgot that this was po=
ssible :)

The validation we=E2=80=99re talking about is for SYSRET, not IRET.  It has i=
ts own set of nasty conditions involving EFLAGS, R11, RIP, and RCX.  Fortuna=
tely no segments are involved. The algorithm is, roughly:

if (okay for SYSRET) {
  SYSRET (and assume it can=E2=80=99t fail)
} else {
  if (need ESPFIX)
   Horrible hacks;
  IRET;
}

And we handle #GP, #SS, #NP and #DF from IRET. And we have selftests for all=
 of this. And no one runs the bloody selftests on 32-bit kernels, resulting i=
n truly awful bugs.

We can=E2=80=99t handle #GP from SYSRET. Thanks, Intel.

(AMD gets this more right. SYSRET is still a turd, but it can=E2=80=99t faul=
t. Intel handles RIP canonical checks differently from AMD, and SYSRET will #=
GP if RCX is noncanonical.  The result was privilege escalation on basically=
 every OS when this was noticed.)=
