So, with this patchset, you can (1) do data access pattern based memory
management optimizations and (2) analyze your program's dynamic data access
pattern.  For the analysis, this patchset also supports visualization of the
pattern in (1) heatmap form and distribution of the (2-1) dynamic working set
size and (2-2) monitoring overhead.

To help you better understand what DAMON can give you, I made web pages showing
the visualized dynamic data access pattern of various realistic workloads,
which I picked up from PARSEC3 and SPLASH-2X bechmark suites.  Note that
another big part of DAMON's usecases, access pattern based optimization is not
demonstrated in the pages, yet.

There are pages showing the heatmap format dynamic access pattern of each
workload for heap area[1], mmap()-ed area[2], and stack[3] area.  I splitted
the entire address space to the three area because the total address space is
too huge.

You can also show how the dynamic working set size of each workload is
distributed, and how it is changing chronologically[5].

The biggest characteristic of DAMON is its promise of the upperbound of
the monitoring overhead.  To show whether DAMON keeps the promise well, I
visualized the number of monitoring operations required for each 5
milliseconds, which is configured to not exceed 1000.  You can show the
distribution of the numbers[6] and how it changes chronologically[7].

As previously mentioned, these are only a fraction of the outputs of DAMON.  I
believe DAMON can be used for more wide and creative purposes.  Nonetheless, I
hope the pages help you understand what DAMON can give you in more intuitive
fashion.
