True, HW doesn't have notion of primary plane. It's just one plane which is 
marked as primary, but otherwise it has same capabilities as others, like x,y 
coordinates, size, etc.

I observed it with DE1, but it has exactly the same issue. I noticed this 
problem on Kodi (gbm version). Kodi first searches for plane capable of 
displaying NV12 format (for video) and after that a plane which is capable of 
displaying RGB888 format (for GUI). In DE1 case, first plane is primary and 
also capable of displaying NV12 format. So when video is displayed which 
doesn't cover whole screen, display output is corrupted. However, with such 
fix, video playback is correct. Luc Verhaegen make equivalent fix for DE1, where 
he also claims primary plane doesn't have to be same size as CRTC output:

Correct, same logic as for overlay planes applies.
