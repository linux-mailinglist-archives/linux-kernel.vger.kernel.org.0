I'm not sure we need to twist ourselves in knots over this.  The TCG
client platform for 2.0 mandates sha256, so we should be able to count
on it being present.  I'd be happy to treat the failure to find sha256
on TPM 2.0 as a fatal error, and the same for the failure to find sha1
on TPM 1.2.

For TPM 1.2 sha1 is required and for TPM2 sha256 is.  I'd just force
search for those, based on the TPM version, and fail to use the TPM if
they're not found.  There should be a boot time and config option for
weird hashes which might be the only ones on BRIC embedded devices,
like Streebog or ZM2, but the clear default should be the TCG mandates
and it should be up to anything weird to cope with their own induced
problems and not make it part of the standard setup.
