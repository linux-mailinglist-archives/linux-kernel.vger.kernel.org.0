IIUC, the problem is that virt can set up a broken topology in some
cases where MPIDR doesn't line up correctly with the defined NUMA nodes.

We could argue that it is a qemu/virt problem, but it would be nice if
we could at least detect it. The proposed patch isn't really the right
solution as it warns on some valid topologies as Sudeep already pointed
out.

It sounds more like we need a mask subset check in the sched_domain
building code, if there isn't already one?
