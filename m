-- I was trying to get the runtime callbacks via controlling the device 
usage_count
Since the usage_count was already incremented by PM core, i was 
decrementing and incrementing (without resume)
so that callbacks are triggered.

I have taken your suggestion on forcing the suspend instead of managing 
it via usage_count.
i'll follow it up in the next patchset.
