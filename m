Complements: or Needed-for: would be better, but with the Fixed tag this
patch would be picked in case the dma_request_chan() conversion patch
gets backported for stable.

Sure. Just checked on my RPi with libreELEC that at least they have the
DMA built in, I assume other distros do the same.

It would be great if this patch would make it to linux-next as soon as
it is possible for sure.

Oh, so you can even have a bug report to back this patch ;)
