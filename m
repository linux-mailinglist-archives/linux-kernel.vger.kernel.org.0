+
+1. Reservation limits
+
+The HugeTLB controller allows to limit the HugeTLB reservations per control
+group and enforces the controller limit at reservation time. Reservation limits
+are superior to Page fault limits (see section 2), since Reservation limits are
+enforced at reservation time, and never causes the application to get SIGBUS
+signal. Instead, if the application is violating its limits, then it gets an
+error on reservation time, i.e. the mmap or shmget return an error.
+
+
+2. Page fault limits
+
+The HugeTLB controller allows to limit the HugeTLB usage (page fault) per
+control group and enforces the controller limit during page fault. Since HugeTLB
+doesn't support page reclaim, enforcing the limit at page fault time implies
+that, the application will get SIGBUS signal if it tries to access HugeTLB
+pages beyond its limit. This requires the application to know beforehand how
+much HugeTLB pages it would require for its use.
+
+
+3. Caveats with shared memory
+
+a. Charging and uncharging:
+
+For shared hugetlb memory, both hugetlb reservation and usage (page faults) are
+charged to the first task that causes the memory to be reserved or faulted,
+and all subsequent uses of this reserved or faulted memory is done without
+charging.
+
+Shared hugetlb memory is only uncharged when it is unreserved or deallocated.
+This is usually when the hugetlbfs file is deleted, and not when the task that
+caused the reservation or fault has exited.
+
+b. Interaction between reservation limit and fault limit.
+
+Generally, it's not recommended to set both of the reservation limit and fault
+limit in a cgroup. For private memory, the fault usage cannot exceed the
+reservation usage, so if you set both, one of those limits will be useless.
+Still, there is no kernel enforcement on setting both at the same time.
+
+For shared memory, a cgroup's fault usage may be greater than its reservation
+usage, so some care needs to be taken. Consider this example:
+
+- Task A reserves 4 pages in a shared hugetlbfs file. Cgroup A will get
+  4 reservations charged to it and no faults charged to it.
+- Task B reserves and faults the same 4 pages as Task A. Cgroup B will get no
+  reservation charge, but will get charged 4 faulted pages. If Cgroup B's limit
+  is less than 4, then Task B will get a SIGBUS.
+
+For the above scenario, it's not recommended for the userspace to set both
+reservation limits and fault limits, but it is still allowed to in case it sees
+some use for it, such as safe gradual transitioning from one to the other.
