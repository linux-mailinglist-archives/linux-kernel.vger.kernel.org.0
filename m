Hmm, I still haven't pinpointed the issue, but I wanted to give a test
of the series and I have:
[    5.511806] i2c_hid i2c-DLL075B:01: HID over i2c has not been
provided an Int IRQ
[    5.511825] i2c_hid: probe of i2c-DLL075B:01 failed with error -22

So it seems that there is something wrong happening when fetching the
IRQ and providing it to i2c-hid.

That was on a Dell XPS 9360.

Bisecting is starting.

Cheers,
Benjamin
