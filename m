Perhaps I didn't express myself clearly. I mean that in the case of the
Hikey960 it would be convenient to have a "dummy regulator" that simply
accepted any change because ultimately Linux doesn't have direct control
of the voltages but simply requests a particular operating frequency via
the mailbox.

No - at the moment if the regulator reports an error then the function
bails out and doesn't change the frequency.

Agreed.

Perhaps there's a better way of doing devfreq? Panfrost itself doesn't
really care must about this - we just need to be able to scaling up/down
the operating point depending on load.

On many platforms to set the frequency it's necessary to do the dance to
set an appropriate voltage before/afterwards, but on the Hikey960
because this is handled via a mailbox we don't actually have a regulator
to set the voltage on. My commit[1] supports this by simply not listing
the regulator in the DT and assuming that nothing is needed when
switching frequency. I'm happy for some other way of handling this if
there's a better method.

At the moment your change from devm_regulator_get_optional() to
devm_regulator_get() is a regression on this platform because it means
there is now a dummy regulator which will always fail the
regulator_set_voltage() calls preventing frequency changes. And I can't
see anything I can do in the DT to fix that.
