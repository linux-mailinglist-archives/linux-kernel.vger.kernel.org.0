Thanks for your reply and the concern.

After taking a look at several driver examples(gma500, android), it 
seems that they are firstly added into drivers/staging/XXX and then 
moved to drivers/XXX after the driver becomes mature.
So we refer to this method to upstream ACRN driver part.

If the new driver can also be added by skipping the staging approach,
we will refine it and then submit it in normal process.

The ACRN driver will be the only user of the added APIs in x86/acrn. 
Without the APIs in x86/acrn, the driver can't add the driver-specifc 
upcall notification ISR or call the hypercall.

Not sure whether it can be sent in two patch sets?
The first is to add the required APIs for ACRN driver.
The second is to add the ACRN driver

Thanks
