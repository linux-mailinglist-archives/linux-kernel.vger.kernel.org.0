I left up the relevant part from the commit message and my 'cover-letter' above
that should contain answers to your question.

In short, the logic is best effort and isn't a hard guarantee. When the system
is overloaded we'll still spread, and a task that needs a big core might end up
on a little one. But AFAIU with RT, if you really want guarantees you need to
do some planning otherwise there are no guarantees in general that your task
will get what it needs.

But I understand your question is for the general purpose case. I've hacked my
notebook to run a few tests for you

	https://gist.github.com/qais-yousef/cfe7487e3b43c3c06a152da31ae09101

Look at the diagrams in "Test {1, 2, 3} Results". I spawned 6 tasks which match
the 6 cores on the Juno I ran on. Based on Linus' master from a couple of days.

Note on Juno cores 1 and 2 are the big cors. 'b_*' and 'l_*' are the task names
which are remnants from my previous testing where I spawned different numbers
of big and small tasks.

I repeat the same tests 3 times to demonstrate the repeatability. The logic
causes 2 tasks to run on a big CPU, but there's spreading. IMO on a general
purpose system this is a good behavior. On a real time system that needs better
guarantee then there's no alternative to doing proper RT planning.

In the last test I just spawn 2 tasks which end up on the right CPUs, 1 and 2.
On system like Android my observations has been that there are very little
concurrent RT tasks active at the same time. So if there are some tasks in the
system that do want to be on the big CPU, they most likely to get that
guarantee. Without this patch what you get is completely random.

I'm not sure I understand your question.

If the RT tasks are affined to a set of CPUs, then we'll only search in these
CPUs. I expect the logic not to change with this patch. If you have a use case
that you think that breaks with this patch, can you please share the details
so I can reproduce?

I just ran several tests spawning 4 tasks affined to the little cores and
I indeed see them spreading on the littles.

Cheers
