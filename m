You'll need the command (and libsensors) from the lm-sensors package version
3.5 or later for it to recognize SCSI/ATA drives.

There is a device/ subdirectory which points to that information.
Is that what you are looking for ? "sensors" displays something
like satatemp-scsi-5-0, which matches sd 5:0:0:0:

Not sure I understand what you mean with 'bazillions of sensors' and
'sensor per scsi_device'. Can you elaborate ? I see one sensor per drive,
which is what I would expect.
