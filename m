Quite possibly, but we should take them case by case.  READ_ONCE()
really does protect against some optimizations, while data_race() does
not at all.

But yes, in some cases you want to -avoid- using READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() so that KCSAN can do its job.  For example, given a per-CPU
variable that is only supposed to be accessed from the corresponding CPU
except for reads by diagnostic code, you should have the main algorithm
use plain C-language reads and writes, and have the diagnostic code
use data_race().  This allows KCSAN to correctly flag bugs that access
this per-CPU variable off-CPU while leaving the diagnostic code alone.

Seem reasonable?
