Should we make the file 0400? It is a useful thing when debugging but
not something regular users would really need for life.

Have you tried to measure that overhead?

But you are still iterating through the whole free_list at once so if it
gets really large then this is still possible. I think it would be
preferable to use per migratetype nr_free if it doesn't cause any
regressions.
