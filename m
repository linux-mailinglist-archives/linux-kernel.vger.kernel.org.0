Precisely, the "canonical" check for asymmetry is static key + SD pointer.
In terms of functionality we could "just" check sd_asym_cpucapacity (it can't
be set without having the static key set, though the reverse isn't true),
but we *want* to use the static key here to make SMP people happy.

Right, when we come back from select_idle_capacity(), and we did go through
the CPU loop, but we still returned -1, it means all CPUs in sd_asym_cpucapacity
were not idle. This includes 'target' of course, so we shouldn't need to
check it again. 

In those cases we might still not have evaluated 'prev' or 'recent_used_cpu'.
It's somewhat of a last ditch attempt to find an idle CPU, and they'll only
help when they aren't in sd_asym_cpucapacity. I'm actually curious as to how
much the 'recent_used_cpu' thing helps, I've never paid it much attention.

So yeah my options are (for asym CPU capacity topologies):
a) just bail out after select_idle_capacity()
b) try to squeeze out a bit more out of select_idle_sibling() by also doing
  the 'prev' & 'recent_used_cpu' checks.

a) is quite easy to implement; I can just inline the static key and sd checks
  in select_idle_sibling() and return unconditionally once I'm past those
  checks.

b) is more intrusive and I don't have a clear picture yet as to how much it
  will really bring to the table.

I'll think about it and try to play around with both of these.
