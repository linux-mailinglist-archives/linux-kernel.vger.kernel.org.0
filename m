I mentioned this in the previous email: you probably want to change
ceph_osdc_wait_requests() so that the counter isn't incremented after
an error is encountered.

Well, that is what I'm getting at -- this needs a lot more
consideration.  How errors are dealt with, how file metadata is
updated, when do we fall back to plain copy, etc.  Generating stray
objects is bad but way better than reporting that e.g. 0..12M were
copied when only 0..4M and 8M..12M were actually copied, leaving
the user one step away from data loss.  One option is to revert to
issuing copy-from requests serially when an error is encountered.
Another option is to fall back to plain copy on any error.  Or perhaps
we just don't bother with the complexity of parallel copy-from requests
at all...

Of course, no matter what we do for parallel copy-from requests, the
existing short copy bug needs to be fixed separately.

Ah, yeah, given have_copy_from2 guard, this particular corner case is
fine.
