Yes, as Shobhit says, this can be observed by watching the voltage of
the CS line during a SPI transaction with no data (but a delay set).
For us, this happens when we toggle the CS line to our security chip
as a way to wake it up before talking to it [1]:

/* Assert CS, wait 1 msec, deassert CS */
struct spi_transfer spi_cs_wake =3D { .delay_usecs =3D 1000 };
spi_sync_transfer(phy->spi_device, &spi_cs_wake, 1);

[1] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/refs/=
heads/chromeos-4.19/drivers/char/tpm/cr50_spi.c#151

We're finding that the line does not in fact toggle in this
transaction, even though the register changes appear to stick.

> This has to be done after one cycle of S0ix.

I don't know about runtime S0ix, but for me this is more related to
runtime PM of the device. For instance, I do this to experiment:

# echo on > /sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:00\:1e.2/power/control
# mem_read32 0xd1226224
0x00001003
# mem_write32 0xd1226224 0x1001 ## This write sticks in the register,
but CS doesn't toggle.
# mem_write32 0xd1226238 0x3 ## Force clock gating on
# mem_write32 0xd1226224 0x1001
# mem_write32 0xd1226224 0x1003 ## Now the writes will both stick and
make it to the CS line.

Interestingly, I can switch clock gating back to auto (0), and writes
continue to make it to the CS line until I re-enable runtime PM.

Shobhit submitted a patch here for the same bug:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11388471/

Interestingly, I notice that the effect seems the same: once you flip
the _SSE bit on, you can also flip it back off and writes will
continue to work until runtime PM is re-enabled.

I don't have the in-depth knowledge of how this controller works, but
my gut says my patch more accurately addresses the underlying problem
by briefly forcing the controller to clock, whereas the other patch
pokes the _SSE enable bit, which forces clocking more as a side
effect. Although, the fact that I can set clock gating back to auto
and things still work until the next runtime suspend makes me feel
like I don't fully understand the issue either. I'm hoping someone
with more internal knowledge can weigh in as to the right approach.

Andy, to answer your other question, I'm unsure whether or not this
needs a delay of a device clock cycle or two to be observed, though in
my experiments it seems like that's not needed. I'm also not sure if
this affects other LPSS blocks, though maybe SPI is special since it
has this externally observable but out-of-band CS line that's not
directly tied to the serial engine.
