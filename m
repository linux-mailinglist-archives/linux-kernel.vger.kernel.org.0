Does that mean you suggest to replace
	BUG_ON(!domain);
with something like
	if (WARN_ON(!domain))
		return;
and to not care of orphaned mappings left allocated?  Is there a way to inform 
users that their active DMA mappings are no longer valid and they shouldn't 
call dma_unmap_*()?

Shouldn't then the IOMMU driver take care of cleaning up resources still 
allocated on device remove before it invalidates and forgets their pointers?

Thanks,
Janusz
