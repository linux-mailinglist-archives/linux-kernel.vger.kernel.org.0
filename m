Yes, there is documentation.  In -next somewhere.  :-/

Very good, then both ->shift and ->offset can be accessed using normal
C-language loads and stores even by most strict definition of data race.

If ->count and ->nr_values are never accessed by readers, they can also
use plain C-language loads and stores.

KCSAN expects that accesses to the ->parent field should be marked.
But if ->parent is always accessed via things like rcu_dereference()
and rcu_assign_pointer() (guessing based on the __rcu), then KCSAN
won't complain.

The ->array can be accessed using plain C-language loads and stores.

If ->private_list is never accessed without holding the lock, then
plain C-language loads and stores work for it without KCSAN complaints.

The situation with ->slots is the same as that for ->parent.

KCSAN expects accesses to the ->tags[] and ->marks[] arrays to be marked.
However, the default configuration of KCSAN asks only that the reads
be marked.  (Within RCU, I instead configure KCSAN so that it asks that
both be marked, but it is of course your choice within your code.)

The answer to both questions is "maybe", depending on the code using
the values read.  Yes, it would be nice if KCSAN could figure out the
difference, but there are limits to what a tool can do.  And things
are sometimes no-obvious, for example:

	switch (foo) {
	case 1:  do_something_1();  break;
	case 3:  do_something_3();  break;
	case 7:  do_something_7();  break;
	case 19: do_something_19(); break;
	case 23: do_something_23(); break;
	}

Only one access to "foo", so all is well, right?

Sadly, wrong.  Compilers can create jump tables, and will often emit two
loads from "foo", one to check against the table size, and the other to
index the table.

Other potential traps may be found in https://lwn.net/Articles/793253/
("Who's afraid of a big bad optimizing compiler?").

One approach is to use READ_ONCE() on the reads in the RCU read-side
critical section that are subject to concurrent update.  Another is to
use the data_race() macro (as in data_race(foo) in the switch statement
above) to tell KCSAN that you have analyzed the compiler's response.
These first two can be mixed, if you like.  And yet another is the patch
proposed by Qian if you want KCSAN to get out of your code altogether.

Within RCU, I mark the accesses rather aggressively.  RCU is quite
concurrent, and the implied documentation is very worthwhile.

Your mileage may vary, of course.  For one thing, your actuarial
statistics are quite likley significantly more favorable than are mine.
Not that mine are at all bad, particularly by the standards of a century
or two ago.  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
