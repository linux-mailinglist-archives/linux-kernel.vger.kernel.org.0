The system map shows:

	ffffffff8225b520 d __syscall_meta__ptrace
	ffffffff8225b560 d args__ptrace
	ffffffff8225b580 d types__ptrace
	ffffffff8225b5c0 D root_user
	ffffffff8225b680 D init_user_ns
	ffffffff8225b880 d ratelimit_state.56624
	ffffffff8225b8c0 d event_exit__sigsuspend

I also searched the uidhack_lock, 
	ffffffff82b04c80 b uidhash_lock

Initially I justed add the ____cacheline_aligned after the definition
of struct 'user_struct', which only makes the following 'init_user_ns'
aligned, and test result doesn't show much change.

Then I added
	
	 struct user_struct {
	 +       char dummy[0] ____cacheline_aligned;

to make 'root_user' itself aligned.

From the perf c2c data, and the source code checking, the conflicts
only happens for root_user.__count, and root_user.sigpending, as
all running tasks are accessing this global data for get/put and
other operations.

No, it's not the biggest, I tried another machine 'Xeon Phi(TM) CPU 7295',
which has 72C/288T, and the regression is not seen. This is the part
confusing me :)

Also I've tried to limit the concurrent task number from 192 to 96/48/24/6/1,
and the regression number did get smaller following the task decrease. 

Thanks,
Feng
