Subject: [PATCH BUGFIX IMPROVEMENT 1/7] block, bfq: reset inject limit when think-time state changes

Until the base value of the request service times gets finally
computed for a bfq_queue, the inject limit does depend on the
think-time state (short|long). The limit must be 0 or 1 if the think
time is deemed, respectively, as short or long. However, such a check
and possible limit update is performed only periodically, once per
second. So, to make the injection mechanism much more reactive, this
commit performs the update also every time the think-time state
changes.

In addition, in the following special case, this commit lets the
inject limit of a bfq_queue bfqq remain equal to 1 even if bfqq's
think time is short: bfqq's I/O is synchronized with that of some
other queue, i.e., bfqq may receive new I/O only after the I/O of the
other queue is completed. Keeping the inject limit to 1 allows the
blocking I/O to be served while bfqq is in service. And this is very
convenient both for bfqq and for the total throughput, as explained
in detail in the comments in bfq_update_has_short_ttime().

+	 * (inclusive) if the change is from short to long think
+	 * time. The reason for this waiting is as follows.
+	 *
+	 * bfqq may have a long think time because of a
+	 * synchronization with some other queue, i.e., because the
+	 * I/O of some other queue may need to be completed for bfqq
+	 * to receive new I/O. This happens, e.g., if bfqq is
+	 * associated with a process that does some sync. A sync
+	 * generates extra blocking I/O, which must be completed
+	 * before the process associated with bfqq can go on with its
+	 * I/O.
+	 *
+	 * If such a synchronization is actually in place, then,
+	 * without injection on bfqq, the blocking I/O cannot happen
+	 * to served while bfqq is in service. As a consequence, if
+	 * bfqq is granted I/O-dispatch-plugging, then bfqq remains
+	 * empty, and no I/O is dispatched, until the idle timeout
+	 * fires. This is likely to result in lower bandwidth and
+	 * higher latencies for bfqq, and in a severe loss of total
+	 * throughput.
+	 *
+	 * On the opposite end, a non-zero inject limit may allow the
+	 * I/O that blocks bfqq to be executed soon, and therefore
+	 * bfqq to receive new I/O soon. But, if this actually
+	 * happens, then the next think-time sample for bfqq may be
+	 * very low. This in turn may cause bfqq's think time to be
+	 * deemed short. Without the 100 ms barrier, this new state
+	 * change would cause the body of the next if to be executed
+	 * immediately. But this would set to 0 the inject
+	 * limit. Without injection, the blocking I/O would cause the
+	 * think time of bfqq to become long again, and therefore the
+	 * inject limit to be raised again, and so on. The only effect
+	 * of such a steady oscillation between the two think-time
+	 * states would be to prevent effective injection on bfqq.
+	 *
+	 * In contrast, if the inject limit is not reset during such a
+	 * long time interval as 100 ms, then the number of short
+	 * think time samples can grow significantly before the reset
+	 * is allowed. As a consequence, the think time state can
+	 * become stable before the reset. There will be no state
+	 * change when the 100 ms elapse, and therefore no reset of
+	 * the inject limit. The inject limit remains steadily equal
+	 * to 1 both during and after the 100 ms. So injection can be
+	 * performed at all times, and throughput gets boosted.
+	 *
+	 * An inject limit equal to 1 is however in conflict, in
+	 * general, with the fact that the think time of bfqq is
+	 * short, because injection may be likely to delay bfqq's I/O
+	 * (as explained in the comments in
+	 * bfq_update_inject_limit()). But this does not happen in
+	 * this special case, because bfqq's low think time is due to
+	 * an effective handling of a synchronization, through
+	 * injection. In this special case, bfqq's I/O does not get
+	 * delayed by injection; on the contrary, bfqq's I/O is
+	 * brought forward, because it is not blocked for
+	 * milliseconds.
+	 *
+	 * In addition, during the 100 ms, the base value for the
