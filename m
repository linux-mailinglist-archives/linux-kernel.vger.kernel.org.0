One thing need to be clarified first (if we're going to do some 
simplification here) is that if we follow the "ITS Restore Sequence"
rule (in Documentation/virt/kvm/devices/arm-vgic-its.rst, which says
that all redistributors are restored *before* ITS table data), then
the pending bits will *only* be restored on the ITE restore path.

When we're restoring the GICR_CTLR, we invoke vgic_enable_lpis()->
its_sync_lpi_pending_table(). But since no LPI has been restored yet,
we will get an empty lpi_list snapshot from vgic_copy_lpi_list().
No pending table synchronization will happen on this path.

I think this is what we have in the current code.


Thanks,
Zenghui
