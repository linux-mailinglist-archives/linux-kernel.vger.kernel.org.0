So, while reviewing the posix timers series, I stumbled upon timer_wait_running() which
lacked any explanation, which led me to hrtimer_cancel_wait_running() that was
a bit more helpful but still had blurry explanation.

In the end I found the approrpiate infomation in this commit changelog.
It might be helpful for future reviewers to apply this:

Subject: [PATCH] hrtimer: Improve comments on handling priority inversion
 against softirq kthread

The handling of a priority inversion between timer cancelling and a
a not well defined possible preemption of softirq kthread is not very
clear. Especially in the posix timers side where we don't even know why
there is a specific RT wait callback.

All the nice explanations can be found in the initial changelog of
f61eff83cec9cfab31fd30a2ca8856be379cdcd5
(hrtimer: Prepare support for PREEMPT_RT"). So lets extract the detailed
informations from there.
