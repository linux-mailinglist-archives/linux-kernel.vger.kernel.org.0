see jhugo's response, he has I guess more access to the bootloader than I

I don't think we can rely on bootloader knowing a thing about DT on
these devices..

OTOH I don't really think it is a big problem for both panels to
probe.  But I suppose it might be possible to have something somewhere
in the kernel that realizes and disables the unused panels.

it matches /chosen/panel-id.. in this case I'm not sure how the
panel-id's are assigned, but for our purposes all that matters is that
they are assigned.

In the non-bridge case (panel hooked directly to dsi controller), the
dsi controller could use the same ports {} mechanism.

For multiple displays, we could extend, I suppose, /chosen/panel-id to
be an array of id's indexed by display.  I think this is the type of
extension we could do later when the use-case comes up.  Just having
this solved upstream for single display would already be a huge
advancement.  (You don't want to look at how this is solved downstream
for android phones.)

Btw, if you are curious how this works on windows/ACPI, the ACPI
tables have entries for each of the panels.  The kernel is expected to
take the panel-id from that EFI variable that jhugo mentioned, and
pass it to a _ROM method which returns the appropriate panel table.
(Not entirely sure how the orchestrate reading the EFI variable early,
since it does not appear to be available after ExitBootServices)
