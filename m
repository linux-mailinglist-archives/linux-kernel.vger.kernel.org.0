The problem is that I don't want to print the trace, I want to fix
some trace files so that another program doesn't barf at them.

I guess I can try to reverse engineer the library code.

It would also be nice if there was a way that some standard program
(like cat) could read out the trace files without blocking at the end
when the trace is inactive.
