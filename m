Hi Greg,

We really appreciate your feedback.

I guess that's the case for every other kobject_uevent*(*, KOBJ_CHANGE)
call in the USB subsystem (in case of either HW or code misbehavior).
JFTR, there are around 120 such calls in the entire v5.2-rc3 kernel.

I checked this patch series in linux-fs.git [3], as well as shared my
thoughts with our security and RFS experts, and we came up with the
following questions/remarks:

 - Looking at commit [4], it seems that the new "notifier" interface/api
   forces userspace applications to link against -lkeyutils [5].
   Assuming the latter is designed for ("Kernel key management") [6],
   it may look like the keyutils library is being abused to handle
   the "USB (or really any hardware events)". Do you really plan to
   extend the scope of the library to handle these new tasks?

 - Currently, to be able to get kobject uevent notifications, our
   applications must include "libudev.h" and must link against -ludev.
   By using the feature implemented in [3], we would significantly
   increase the complexity of those applications, particularly because
   they would need to arbitrate between two different categories of
   events received via two different APIs.

 - It is also my assumption that the existing KOBJ_CHANGE events cannot
   be easily converted to the new API, since this would hurt a dozen of
   userland applications relying on them.

Overall, I am quite clueless how to proceed with this patch, except to
keep it in our internal tree, most likely forever. Any
comments/recommendations would be appreciated.
