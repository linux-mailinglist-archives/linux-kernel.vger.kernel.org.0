This is the sort of thing you need to confirm by experimenting.  It is 
not at all clear that doubling the interrupt rate will also double the 
CPU load, especially if half of the interrupts don't require the CPU to 
do much work.

That's right.

Let's say you ask for an interrupt for only even-numbered requests.  
Then there would be at most one 0-length request queued when a new
video frame arrives.  Processing that 0-length request should require
very little CPU time (almost none) because it contains no data, so the
extra latency would be negligible.

What matters is the interrupt rate.  If you double the rate at which 
transfers are queued but ask for an interrupt on only half of them, 
then the overall interrupt rate will remain the same and so will the 
average latency.

The same would be true if you queued a request at the full isochronous
rate.  If video data is present, put it in the request; if not then
queue a 0-length request.

Are you talking about the driver on the gadget side or on the host 
side?  The rules for the host-side driver are spelled out in the 
kerneldoc for usb_submit_urb().  As far as I know, there is no 
equivalent set of rules for the gadget-side drivers.

I don't know.  You can ask the UVC maintainer for more information; my 
guess is that it treats 0-length packets and missing packets the same.  
After all, what else could it do?  Either way, there is no data.
