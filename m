I don't have a number but my test with 4.17 is to run
'cat /etc/passwd > /dev/tty1' over a serial cable. The first 2-3 calls
will fill up the screen and the file contents appear to show up on the
screen immediately to the human eye. The next time that I run it
requires scrolling the entire console and there is a small fraction of
a second where I see the entire framebuffer contents scroll up. I
don't have a graphics background, but I believe that this is the
tearing effect that I'm seeing based on what I've read. I believe that
disp-te-gpios can be used to mitigate this tearing effect. I have a few
questions about this later once we get the basic display working.

I previously raised those timeouts as high as 5 seconds and it still
has the same issue. Writing to /dev/tty1 can take anywhere between a few
seconds to 30 seconds or more.
