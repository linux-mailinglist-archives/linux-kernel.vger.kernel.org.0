As long as it is documented that implicit alignment will happen, fine 
with me.

The thing about !is_power_of2() is that we usually don't need an 
alignment there (or instead an explicit one). And as I mentioned, the 
current function might fail easily to allocate a suitable range due to 
the way the search works (== check aligned blocks only). The search 
really only provides reliable results when size==alignment and it's a 
power of two IMHO. Not documenting that is in my opinion misleading - 
somebody who wants !is_power_of2() and has no alignment requirements 
should probably rework the function first.

So with some documentation regarding that
