Large gup might push usage close to limit and keep it here for a some time.
As a result concurrent allocations will enter direct reclaim right at
charging much more frequently.


Right now deferred recalaim after passing high limit works like distributed
memcg kswapd which reclaims memory in "background" and prevents completely
synchronous direct reclaim.

Maybe somebody have any plans for real kswapd for memcg?


I've put mem_cgroup_handle_over_high in gup next to cond_resched() and
later that gave me idea that this is good place for running any
deferred works, like bottom half for tasks. Right now this happens
only at switching into userspace.
