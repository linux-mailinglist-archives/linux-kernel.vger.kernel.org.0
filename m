... yet nobody really cares about different return code. It is an error
that is propagated up the call chain and that's all.

I also like when there is a kernel doc comment that helps to understand
the intented usage, context the function can be called from, potential
side effects, locking requirements and other details people need to know
when calling functions. But have a look at 
/**
 * clear_subsection_map - Clear subsection map of one memory region
 *
 * @pfn - start pfn of the memory range
 * @nr_pages - number of pfns to add in the region
 *
 * This is only intended for hotplug, and clear the related subsection
 * map inside one section.
 *
 * Return:
 * * -EINVAL	- Section already deactived.
 * * 0		- Subsection map is emptied.
 * * 1		- Subsection map is not empty.
 */

the only useful information in here is that this is a hotplug stuff but
I would be completely lost about the intention without already knowing
what is this whole subsection about.
