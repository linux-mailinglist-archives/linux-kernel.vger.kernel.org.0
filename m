Hi Lukasz

In fact yes, we do not want to care: it returns true or false depending on the
fact that the specific work was or not already queued, and we just rely on
this behavior to keep kicking the worker only when needed but never kick
more than one instance of it per-queue (so that there's only one reader
wq and one writer here in the scmi_notify)...explaining better:

1. we push an event (hdr+payld) to the protocol queue if we found that there was
enough space on the queue

2a. if at the time of the kfifo_in( ) the worker was already running
(queue not empty) it will process our new event sooner or later and here
the queue_work will return false, but we do not care in fact ... we
tried to kick it just in case

2b. if instead at the time of the kfifo_in() the queue was empty the worker would
have probably already gone to the sleep and this queue_work() will return true and
so this time it will effectively wake up the worker to process our items

The important thing here is that we are sure to wakeup the worker when needed
but we are equally sure we are never causing the scheduling of more than one worker
thread consuming from the same queue (because that would break the one reader/one writer
assumption which let us use the fifo in a lockless manner): this is possible because
queue_work checks if the required work item is already pending and in such a case backs
out returning false and we have one work_item (notify_work) defined per-protocol and
so per-queue.

Now probably I wrote too much of an explanation and confuse stuff more ... :D
