1. As explained these chanegs need to stay together
2. This change is primarily a drm/i915 change. Also the i915 code sees lots
of changes every cycle, where as the change to the mfd code touches a block
of code which has not been touched since 2015-06-26, so the chance of conflicts
is much bigger if this goes on through another tree.

I honestly do not see the problem here? Let me reverse the question why should this
NOT go in through the drm tree?

Regards,

Hans
