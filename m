One could argue that :)

Given that I really think you are just making something up here that no
one really is needing for their workflow, but would just be "cool to
have", I say do whatever you think is right.

And there is nothing wrong with "cool to have" things, I'm not trying to
dismiss this, it's just that all new features come with the "you must
support this until the end of time" requirement that we must balance it
with.

Ok, fair enough, although if you just add a new sysrq option for "what
is running on this tty", would that help resolve this?

If you have access to a tty, you should have access to sysrq, right?

It is, yes.  My big objection is the crazy code I point out above, as
well as the "create a totally new interface when we might be able to use
an existing one" that you need to convince me is really required :)
