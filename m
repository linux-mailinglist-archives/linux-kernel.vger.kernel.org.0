This could definitely use being both split up and reordered, it's a 34
patch series as things stand which is just far too big and I don't
understand the ordering within the series - there's a mix of fixes,
cleanups and new features which should come in that order but don't.
This makes it difficult to get a handle on what's going on because what
the series is doing jumps about a lot.  There's also a lot of overuse of
fixes tags and stable tags which also makes things less clear.  I'd
suggest first sending all the clear fixes as a separate series with the
cleanups and new functionality separate.

With regard to the ABI breaks they *may* be OK for mainline if we're
confident that there's not going to be anyone broken by them but we
should be looking to maintain compatibility if we can even if that's the
case.
