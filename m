Usually on such patches I have two (a bit contradicted) wishes:
- be as little as needed
- for sake of documentation purposes keep as many definitions as we can

But you know the dangling code / definitions not accepted by all maintainers.

So, that said, I have no strong opinion here, basically rely on maintainer's
point of view.

Perhaps also good idea is to put a reference as URL to the published code from
which this has been derived.
