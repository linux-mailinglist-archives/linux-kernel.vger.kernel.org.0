Hello Michal,

I was under the impression (seems wrongful now) that the previous discussion
was complete. Nonetheless we can still discuss it further. Mark has responded
on the previous V3 thread [1] and because this particular patch does not have
any changes from last time, we can continue discussing this in that thread.
