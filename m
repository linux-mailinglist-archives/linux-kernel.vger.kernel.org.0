Ben wrote the code and is the primary author. I helped with some
changes to bring it closer to normal style, so I have definitely
been a secondary co-developer. Ben's corporate email server adds a
generic confidentiality notice outside his control, and we were
informed that with that header on the email the patches could not
be accepted.  We developed it in a git repository, so that I have
not been "tainted" by the automatic confidentiality notice, and
at Ben's request I have posted the work. To credit me as primary
author would be fundamentally incorrect.

Are you saying that this work cannot be accepted until Ben chooses
an alternative email provider besides his corporate email in order
to avoid the spurious confidentiality notice, such that he is the
sender of the email?
