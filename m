Sorry for the delay, yesterday was rough.

To be fair, the kerninfo line itself is intended for the user's eyes; it
can't even be programmatically read by anyone in a Linux system except
pty masters, so I don't feel it has to be particularly stable, since
changing its contents won't break anyone.
So IMO we could still tweak something about it after we merge this.
Of course this cannot be said about the signal part of the patch series,
which interfaces with processes and is a proper part of the outward
kernel API, thus subject to the kernel's policy.

I see at least two problems here:
1) sysrq is not accessible by unprivileged users (and here goes the
   whole idea of sysrq being designed for different purposes, etc.)
2) Even if we fix it and somehow allow unpriv users to do the equivalent
   of `echo $letter > /proc/sysrq-trigger' for a particular letter,
   there still are UI issues.  (yes, UI issues are better dealt with
   outside the kernel, but that's not the point) It still has to dump
   info to the particular tty (let's remember, console is unaccessible
   and shared to the whole system), that is a novelty for sysrq. There
   still is the open question about how to make a VSTATUS press trigger
   that sysrq button in addition to signalling fg pgrp without shoving
   this bit into every other userspace program.

To sum up, this looks worse to me than integrating with n_tty.

In general, the main appeal of the feature is in it being activated by a
single keypress handled by the line discipline, from any tty.

No.
SSH gives you access to a pty, which doesn't seem to handle BREAK; the
BREAK SysRq activation method does not work there.
As Pavel correctly noted, if the user is unprivileged, they can't use
/proc/sysrq-trigger as well.

The signal part (patches [1-4]/7) is not really new, since we've had
Unix-like signals for ages.
(You've probably meant the [5-7]/7, but there's no such thing as a too
detailed explanation).
The compelling reasons for a new signal are:
- it provides asynchronous process notification, as opposed to e. g. a
  POLLIN on a file descriptor, which is not noticed by the recipient
  until they poll(2);
- to make use of the mechanism, an existing app does not have to be
  rewritten in a certain way =E2=80=94 a signal handler just gets called, i=
f the
  signal is not blocked =E2=80=94 so it's easy to use from applications.
- it aligns well with the current practice of the line discipline
  relaying user requests to processes via signals.

As for the line: before I started writing the patch I thought a lot
about how we could move the status line logic away from n_tty and, when
^T is pressed, have it notify someone in userspace, who would look up
all the pieces in /proc and write() the line to the tty. Obviously this
approach should be much more flexible and easier to maintain from the
kernel perspective.  One candidate for this could actually be the tty's
session leader (most often that's the interactive shell).

To be convenient, the feature needs to have at least the following
qualities:
- the status line has to come first, since it's the only invariant; this
  way it's easy to visually find if needed and just as easy to ignore
  otherwise;
- the reaction to VSTATUS has to be as responsive as it can reasonably
  be and as the system load allows. (btw, SysRq does well in this
  regard, but the drawbacks outweigh this, see above)
The only way we can secure the first point is to signal a process, wait
for it to get scheduled, wait a little more for it to compose and send
output, and only then to signal the pgrp and be done. This is
potentially slow and might lock up the tty's input receive queue for
sizable amounts of time. What if the session leader opts-in to do this
and then ignores this kind of request / never responds altogether? This
gets messy fast. So we can't guarantee the second point.
If we focus on responsiveness, we can't wait for processes at all, so we
ping them and be done with it. This means no output ordering guarantees,
it all gets interleaved and, consequently, less readable and less useful
overall.
Further tweaking the protocol gives the risk of making it too complicated.

So I gave up on the idea and went with this patch, which ticks both boxes
mentioned above. Of course, I'd love to have an ideal solution, and a
pony too. :)

(Or perhaps I'm thinking inside the box and missing a clue and someone
reading this does not. This is a public list, anyway)
