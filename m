It doesn't solve this problem, but at least we could remove the 
iommu_ops check in iort_iommu_xlate().

We would need to carve out a path from pci_device_add() or even 
device_add() to solve all cases.

We could still use a bus walk to add the group per iommu, but we would 
need an additional check to ensure the device is associated with the IOMMU.

I'm not too familiar with the history here, but could this be reverted 
now with the introduction of of_devlink stuff?
