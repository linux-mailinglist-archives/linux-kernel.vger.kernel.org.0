Yes, this is also what is my understanding with regards to chacha official 
security strength. But our use case and requirements are slightly different
and can be in future upgraded, if needed, but let's indeed then try per-cpu
buffer solution that Andy is proposing first to see if it is satisfactory performance-
wise with chacha20, which probably stays secure for much longer unless whole
construction is fully broken.

Yes, agree, so this is what I am going to try then.

I can try measuring both ways given that we ask for enough random bits as Andy suggested. 
Couple of pages or so, if it helps with overhead. Also, hope none of these specific 
Instructions (including AES-NI) can block, as I was pointed out with RDRAND, otherwise
I guess we have a problem.. 

> Also consider AES-CTR with AES-NI instructions.

Yes, I guess based on these numbers they go hand in hand with chacha8 (depending on CPU):
https://bench.cr.yp.to/results-stream.html
Also need to compare cases when no special instructions are available I guess when choosing a primitive
here...

Elena.
