Why do we not want to expose them all? I figured if there's a cma
heap, then a device you have needs it, and if that's the case you
might want to allocate for that device from the heap? Maybe link to
the discussion?

I'm not sold on the use-case for this, but maybe if I see the actual
use-cases I might be swayed. A very basic/minimal "register a new
dma-buf heap" function should be all that's really needed for android,
so maybe we can start with that?
