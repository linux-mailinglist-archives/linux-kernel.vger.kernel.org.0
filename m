tbf, my complaint was actually about some macros applying to the whole
PMU whilst others refer only to DMC/L3C and this not being apparent from
the naming:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/6/27/250

so I'm fine having TX2_PMU_DMC_L3C_MAX_COUNTERS and
TX2_PMU_CCPI2_MAX_COUNTERS, but that sort of naming needs to be consistent
unless the macro/definition really applies to both. That fed the suggestion
that GET_EVENTID could be generic and switch on the event type internally
instead of at the caller.
