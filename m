By rerunning sysbench mariadb test of mmtest, I didn't see too many THPs 
in the peak. I saw around 2K THPs sometimes on my VM with 40G memory. 
But they were short-lived (should be freed when the test exit). And, the 
number of accumulated THPs are variable.

And, this reminded me to go back double check our internal bug report 
which lead to the "make deferred split shrinker memcg aware" patchset.

In that case, a mysql instance with real production load was running in 
a memcg with ~86G limit, the number of deferred split THPs may reach to 
~68G (~34K deferred split THPs) in a few hours. The deferred split THP 
shrinker was not invoked since global memory pressure is still fine 
since the host has 256G memory, but memcg limit reclaim was triggered.

And, I can't tell if all those deferred split THPs came from mysql or 
not since there were some other processes run in that container too 
according to the oom log.

I will update the commit log with the more solid data from production 
environment.

This leads to another question, how many THPs are "a batch of worth"? 
And, they may be short-lived as showed by Kirill's example, we can't 
tell in advance how long the THPs life time is. We may waste cpu cycles 
to do something unneeded.
