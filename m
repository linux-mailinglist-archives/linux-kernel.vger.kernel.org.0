The patch

   dt-bindings: Convert the binding file google, cros-ec-codec.txt to yaml format.

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.7

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

-Audio codec controlled by ChromeOS EC
-
-Google's ChromeOS EC codec is a digital mic codec provided by the
-Embedded Controller (EC) and is controlled via a host-command interface.
-
-An EC codec node should only be found as a sub-node of the EC node (see
-Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/cros-ec.txt).
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible: Must contain "google,cros-ec-codec"
-- #sound-dai-cells: Should be 1. The cell specifies number of DAIs.
-
-Optional properties:
-- reg: Pysical base address and length of shared memory region from EC.
-       It contains 3 unsigned 32-bit integer.  The first 2 integers
-       combine to become an unsigned 64-bit physical address.  The last
-       one integer is length of the shared memory.
-- memory-region: Shared memory region to EC.  A "shared-dma-pool".  See
-                 ../reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt for details.
-
-Example:
-
-{
-	...
-
-	reserved_mem: reserved_mem {
-		compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
-		reg = <0 0x52800000 0 0x100000>;
