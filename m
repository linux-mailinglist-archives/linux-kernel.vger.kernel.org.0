I will leave the maintainers answering to that.

If we decide to disable the driver, then we would need to add in our .config, 
then we would need to disable completely the support for Qualcomm (i.e 
CONFIG_ARCH_QCOM=n) on Arm32.

This should not be an issue in osstest as we don't test any qualcomm board so far.
