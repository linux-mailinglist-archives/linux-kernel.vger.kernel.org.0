Subject: [PATCH] fix cast of gfp_t to ulong in __def_gfpflag_names
Date:   Wed,  4 Dec 2019 18:54:25 +0100
Message-Id: <20191204175425.71855-1-luc.vanoostenryck@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.24.0
MIME-Version: 1.0

The macro '__def_gfpflag_names' is used to define arrays of
struct trace_print_flags. This structure is defined as being
a pair of 'unsigned long' - 'const char *'.

However, the macro __def_gfpflag_names is used to for GFP flags
and thus take entries of type gfp_t (plus their name) which
is a bitwise type, non-convertible to usual integers.
These entries are casted to 'unsigned long' but this doesn't
prevent Sparse to rughtfully complain:
	warning: cast from restricted gfp_t

The correct way to cast a bitwise type to a normal integer
(which is OK here) is to use '__force'.

So, fix the cast by adding the '__force' required for such casts.
