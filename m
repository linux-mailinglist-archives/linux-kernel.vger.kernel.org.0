this is what I see:

Scope (HDAS)
         {
             Device (IDA)
             {
                 Name (_ADR, 0x00020001)  // _ADR: Address
             }
         }

I thought this was nonsense but your question triggered me to look into 
the Intel SST ACPI specs (not public I am afraid but shared with the OS 
who shall not be named).
Using the same source of information as below, I *believe* this is 
HDaudio related, bits 31..16 mean HDaudio with codec SDI 2, and NodeId 1 
for the function group. This would make sense as I believe there are two 
codecs on the board that can be pin-strapped to boot either in HDaudio 
or SoundWire mode- but this is a conjecture only.

At any rate, we need a hardware rework and mutual exclusion between 
HDaudio and SoundWire, so we have to ignore this one when SoundWire is 
enabled.

I thought it was a magic number, but I did check and for once it's 
documented and the values match the spec :-)
I see in the ACPI docs bits 31..28 set to 4 indicate a SoundWire Link 
Type and bits 3..0 indicate the SoundWire controller instance, the rest 
is reserved to zero.

I will respin this one to add the documentation above, and only filter 
on the 4 ms-bits. Thanks for forcing me to RTFM :-)
