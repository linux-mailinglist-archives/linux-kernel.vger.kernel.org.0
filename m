I am surely missing something as I don't see how that patchset will
make this patchset perform badly, than what it already does.

The idea of this patchset is to find a CPU which can run the task the
soonest if no other CPU is idle. If a CPU is idle we still want to run
the task on that one to finish work asap. This patchset only updates
the fast path right now and doesn't touch slow-path and periodic/idle
load-balance path. That would be the next step for sure though.

Steve's patchset (IIUC) adds a new fast way of doing idle-load-balance
at the LLC level, that is no different than normal idle-load-balancing
for this patchset. In fact, I will say that Steve's patchset makes our
work easier to extend going forward as we can capitalize on the new
*fast* infrastructure to pull tasks even when a CPU isn't fully idle
but only has sched-idle stuff on it.

Does this makes sense ?

@Song: Thanks for giving this a try and I am really happy to see your
results. I do see that we still don't get the performance we wanted,
perhaps because we only touch the fast path. Maybe load-balance screws
it up for us at a later point of time and CPUs are left with only
sched-idle tasks. Not sure though.
