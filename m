I have no idea why they haven’t made everything upstream, and I do hope  
they did a better job, so I don’t need to cleanup their driver and send it  
upstream :(

So basically I can’t answer any of your questions. As Larry suggested,  
their driver should be hosted separately and maybe by downstream distro.
