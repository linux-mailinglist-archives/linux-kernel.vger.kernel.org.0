Thanks for digging through this.

So did you do any operation that left you with
    cpu_active_mask & 0xf0 == 0
?

(If so, I think the demo code should be made without it to avoid the
confusion.)

Regardless, the demo code should also specify in what cpuset it happens
(for the v2 case).

Yes, it seems to me to be somewhat analogous to effective_cpus vs
cpus_allowed in the v2 cpuset.

I see the original version made the state = cpuset in select_fallback_rq
mostly redundant. The split on v2 (hierarchy) in v2 (patch) makes some
sense. Although, on v1 we will lose the "no longer affine to..." message
(which is what happens in your demo IIUC).
