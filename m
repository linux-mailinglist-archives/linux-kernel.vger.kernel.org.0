Ah, disabling this makes it compile.

Unfortunately it is not explicitly disabled by e.g. omap2plus_defconfig =
and therefore
automatically set through the "default y". So I have to manipulate the =
defconfig first.

Yes, fixes this issue.

Looks similar although not a compiler but linker error. Which indicates =
a library search issue.

Unfortunately gcc plugins is something I didn't even know that it exists =
until some hours ago :)

So I have no idea where e.g. _plugin_default_version_check, =
_default_target_rtl or _register_callback
should be provided.

If it is part of the gcc build-from-source tree I may have a chance to =
add the path to the CCXFLAGS.
Or is it to be provided from the kernel tree?

I think Debian Jessie used the same compiler version as default gcc.
