We should ask why this this is handled this way.

My understanding is to give user feedback that something is going
to happen when the system is not responsive and sysrq is the last
chance to get some information, sync, and reboot.

Maybe, it is not needed these days when the console loglevel
might be manipulated by sysrq as well.

Sounds reasonable.

I do not agree with this. Nobody cared about printk() deadlocks in NMI
for a long time. The idea was that people just should not print
anything there.

Reality shown that people just printed from this context and we needed
to make printk() safe there.

IMHO, expecting that all messages in NMI context are super important
is a similar mistake.

Also sysrq-l prints all backtraces from NMI context. It is huge
amount of output. People might want just store it into the logbuffer.
It is the same as with sysrq-t mentioned above.

This is too generic and complicated.

Only the single pr_info() in __handle_sysrq() seems to be called with
interrupts enabled. And it happens only when it is triggered via
/proc/sysrq-trigger. Manipulating the console loglevel is
questionable there.

Using the existing printk_context is good enough.

Also the final output is either LOG_ALWAYS_CON or LOG_NEVER_CON.
The API should not pretend that it supports any loglevel granularity.

If we end up with the two states, the API should consist of three
functions, e.g.

   int set_console_verbose(unsigned long *flags);
   int set_console_quiet(unsigned long *flags);
   restore_console_loglevel(int loglevel, unsigned long flags);

Where the first two functions should return the original loglevel
and irqflags.
