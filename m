It might be worth fixing the unbalance since mlock depends on this flag 
too. There should be a little bit overhead when handling PTE rmap remove 
since we have to iterate every subpage to check if _mapcount is same 
with compound_mapcount or not in order to clear DoubleMap flag. It is 
easy to handle this when the last PMD map is gone.
