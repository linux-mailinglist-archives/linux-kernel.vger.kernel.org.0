Having an implementation that uses small fixed size buffers seems very
reasonable and I'm in favour of making the message size configurable.

I would however prefer to have this implemented in a way where the
remote side should not be receiving messages in a way that's based on
the remote side's allocation parameters.


I don't think this series prevents the introduction of such isolation,
but it would render this code unnecessary.
