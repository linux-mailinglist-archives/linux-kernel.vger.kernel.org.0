Thanks a lot for your help!  The updated patch is as follows.  It
targets only the scan period aspects.

Subject: [PATCH] autonuma: Fix scan period updating

From the commit log and comments of commit 37ec97deb3a8 ("sched/numa:
Slow down scan rate if shared faults dominate"), the autonuma scan
period should be increased (scanning is slowed down) if the majority
of the page accesses are shared with other processes.  But in current
code, the scan period will be decreased (scanning is speeded up) in
that situation.

The commit log and comments make more sense.  So this patch fixes the
code to make it match the commit log and comments.  And this has been
verified via tracing the scan period changing and /proc/vmstat
numa_pte_updates counter when running a multi-threaded memory
accessing program (most memory areas are accessed by multiple
threads).

Fixes: 37ec97deb3a8 ("sched/numa: Slow down scan rate if shared faults dominate")
