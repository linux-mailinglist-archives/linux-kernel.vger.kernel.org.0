No.  DMA master address space in virtual machines is pretty much the
same it is on physical machines.  So, on x86 without iommu, identical
to (guest) physical address space.  You can't re-define it like that.

s/other virtio devices/other devices/

dma-bufs are for buffer sharing between devices, not limited to virtio.
You can't re-define that in some virtio-specific way.

Yes, the iommu (if present) could remap your scatterlist that way.  You
can't depend on that though.

What is the plan here?  Host-side buffer sharing I guess?  So you are
looking for some way to pass buffer handles from the guest to the host,
even in case those buffers are not created by your driver but imported
from somewhere else?

cheers,
