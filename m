Hi Andre,

(thanks for digging into this!)

Everywhere x86. /proc/cpuinfo is unfortunately arch specific, arm64 spells that field 'CPU
implementer'. Short of invoking lscpu, I don't know a portable way of finding this string.

What do we need it for? Surely it indicates something is wrong with the kernel interface
if you need to know which flavour of CPU this is.

The only differences I've spotted are the 'MAX_MBA_BW' on Intel is a percentage, on AMD
its a number between 1 and 2K. If user-space needs to know we could add another file with
the 'max_bandwidth'. (I haven't spotted how the MBA default_ctrl gets exposed).

The other one is the non-contiguous CBM values, where user-space is expected to try it and
see [0]. If user-space needs to know, we could expose some 'sparse_bitmaps=[0 1]', unaware
user-space keeps working.


Thanks,

James
