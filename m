Wait, why do you need to call this with the parent dev?  Why not with
your struct device?  What does the parent pointer have that yours does
not?  Is it not correctly having whatever dma attributes the parent has
set properly for your device as well?  If not, why not just fix that and
then _your_ device can be doing the allocation?
