Summary is that there exists an ACPI firmware field which we could 
expose to userspace via sysfs - this would provide the system id. 
However there is a proposal to deprecate it in the ACPI standard and, as 
such, would prefer that we don't add kernel support for it at this stage.

So I am evaluating the alternative in the meantime, which again is some 
firmware method which should allow us to expose a system id to userspace 
via sysfs. Unfortunately this is arm specific. However, other archs can 
still provide their own method, maybe a soc driver:

OK, let me consider this part for perf test support.

Thanks,
