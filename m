Or the untrusted runtime needs to wrap the __vdso() to save state that is
clobbered by the enclave.  Just want to make it crystal clear that using a
handler is only required for stack shenanigans.

Unless I'm misunderstanding the request, this already exists.  %rsp at the
time of EEXIT is passed to the handler.

Can you elaborate on why you want to sub/add to %rsp instead of having the
enclave unwind the stack?  Preserving %rsp across EEXIT/ERESUME seems more
in line with function call semantics, which I assume is desirable?  E.g.

  push param3
  push param2
  push param1

  enclu[EEXIT]

  add $0x18, %rsp
