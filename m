I'm more worried about the performance implications. Consider
libc.so's data section: that's a COW mapping, and we COW it during
zygote initialization as we load and relocate libc.so. Child processes
shouldn't be dirtying and re-COWing those relocated pages. If I
understand Jann's message correctly, MADV_PAGEOUT would force the
pages corresponding to the libc.so data segment out to zram just
because we MADV_PAGEOUT-ed a single process that happened to use libc.
We should leave those pages in memory, IMHO.
