>=20

I do think the right way forward with this longstanding problem is to
take the burden of managing free memory away from end user and let the
kernel autotune itself to the demands of workload. We can start with a
simpler algorithm in the kernel that adapts to workload and refine it as
we move forward. As long as initial implementation performs at least as
well as current free page management, we have a workable path for
improvements. I am moving the implementation I put together in kernel to
a userspace daemon just to test it out on larger variety of workloads.
It is more limited in userspace with limited access to statistics the
algorithm needs to perform trend analysis so I would rather be doing
this in the kernel.
