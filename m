OK, but I was under the impression that it was made clear that Linux is
not firmware validation suite. The firmware need to ensure all the devices
that are not accessible in the Linux kernel are marked as disabled and
this needs to happen before entering the kernel. So if this is what this
patch series achieves, then there is no need for it. Please stop pursuing
this any further or provide any other reasons(if any) to have it. Until
you have other reasons, NACK for this series.
