It has been testing on your side for quite long time, and I don't have
better idea on the fix. It looks solid enough, and indeed I have it in
my development patches already with more testing.

> have been reported so far. Do you think we can add this to linux-next?

Yes, this is my plan. It is in my testing queue with other developing
patches.

Thanks.
