People have tried to do this multiple times, and you never really know
when "boot is done" due to busses that have discoverable devices and
async probing of other busses.

You do know "something" when you pivot to a new boot disk, and when you
try to load init, but given initramfs and the fact that modules are
usually included on them, that's not really a good indication that
anything is "finished".

I don't want userspace to be responsible for telling the kernel, "hey
you should be finished now!", as that's an async notification that is
going to be ripe for problems.

I really like the "depends-on" information, as it shows a topology that
DT doesn't seem to be able to show today, yet we rely on it in the
kernel with the whole deferred probing mess.  To me, there doesn't seem
to be any other way to properly "know" this.

timeouts suck.  And do not work for shipping products.  I want a device
with 100 modules that relys on DT to be able to boot just as fast as a
laptop with 100 modules that has all of the needed dependancies
described today in their bus topologies, because they used sane hardware
(i.e. PCI and ACPI).  Why hurt embedded people just because their
hardware relies on a system where you have to loop for long periods of
time because DT can not show the topology correctly?

What does a console have to do with any of this?
