Although I appreciate you going the extra mile for arm64 (thanks!), I think
this is probably a bit overkill given that I don't plan to merge the series
from Zengruan any time soon. Instead, how about just defining
vcpu_is_preempted in arch/arm64/include/asm/spinlock.h with a comment:


	/*
	 * Changing this will break osq_lock() thanks to the call inside
	 * smp_cond_load_relaxed().
	 *
	 * See:
	 * https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200110100612.GC2827@hirez.programming.kicks-ass.net
	 */
	#define vcpu_is_preempted(cpu)	false


So we'll notice that when somebody tries to change it.
