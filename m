Looking deeper. The code in common_exception does:

	movl	PT_ORIG_EAX(%esp), %edx		# get the error code
	movl	$-1, PT_ORIG_EAX(%esp)		# no syscall to restart

So whatever the exception pushed on the stack the thing what
collect_syscall finds is -1.

The pushed value is used as the error_code argument for the exception
handler and I really can't find a single one which cares (anymore).

But darn and I overlooked that, it's propagated to do_trap() and
friends, but even if this causes a user visible change, I doubt that
anything cares about it today simply because for giggles a 64bit kernel
unconditionally pushes 0 for all exceptions which do not have a hardware
error code on stack. So any 32bit application which excpects a
particular error code (0/-1) in the signal would have been broken on the
first day it ran on a x64 bit kernel.

If someone yells regression, then that's really trivial to fix in
C-code.

Let me rephrase the changelog for this.

Thanks,
