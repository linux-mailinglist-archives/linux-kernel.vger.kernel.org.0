I did not ignore it. When I ran the dt-binding check locally, it did not
error out and just passed on [1] and it was my bad that I did not check
the entire build logs to see if llcc dt binding check had some warning 
or
not. But this is the usual case where most of us don't look at the 
entire
build logs to check if there is a warning or not. We notice if there is 
an
immediate exit/fail in case of some warning/error. So it would be good 
if
we fail the dt-binding check build if there is some warning/error or 
atleast
provide some option to strict build to fail on warning, maybe there is 
already
a flag to do this?

After submitting the patch, I noticed this build failure on
patchwork.ozlabs.org and was waiting for your reply.

This is not L2 or L3 cache, this is a system cache (last level cache) 
shared by
clients other than just CPU. So I don't know how do we specify 
cache-level for
this, let me know if you have some pointers.
