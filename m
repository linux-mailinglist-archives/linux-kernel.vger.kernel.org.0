Let's add a WARN() or something then as if this ever happens this is

Is it safe to call hv_poll_channel() simultaneously on several CPUs? It
seems it is as we're doing=20

smp_call_function_single(channel->target_cpu, cb, channel, true);

(I'm asking because if it's not, than doing what you suggest will open
the following window: timeout function kvp_timeout_func() is already
running but the daemon is trying to reply at the same moment).

I think we can also teach daemons to ignore -EINVAL or switch to
something like -EAGAIN in non-fatal cases.

Maybe, if we don't need it than we don't. Basically, I see the only
advantage in having such state: it makes our tricks to support
hibernation more visible in the code.
