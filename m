Hi Bj=C3=B8rn,

Besides the production use you are referring to, there are 2 cases we
should take into account as well:
1. Testing.
Any kernel testing system needs a binary criteria for detecting kernel
bugs. It seems right to detect unkillable hung tasks as kernel bugs.
Which means that we need to resolve this in some way regardless of the
production scenario.
2. Reliable killing of processes.
It's a very important property that an admin or script can reliably
kill whatever process/container they need to kill for whatever reason.
This case results in an unkillable process, which means scripts will
fail, automated systems will misbehave, admins will waste time (if
they are qualified to resolve this at all).
