We thought it should be controlled by admins and transparent to the
end users. The ratio is fixed, but the memory could be moved between
DRAM and PMEM dynamically as long as it doesn't exceed the ratio so
that we could keep warmer data in DRAM and colder data in PMEM.

I talked this about in LSF/MM, please check this out:
