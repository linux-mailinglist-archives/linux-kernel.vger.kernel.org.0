Hello Linus,

Please pull these arm64 updates for 5.6. I'm sending this now because
I'm away from tomorrow until Monday and, since the branch is tagged and
ready to go, why wait?

There's a summary in the tag, although the changes are a real mixed bag
this time around. The only scary looking one from the diffstat is the
uapi change to asm-generic/mman-common.h, but this has been acked by
Arnd and is actually just adding a pair of comments in an attempt to
prevent allocation of some PROT values which tend to get used for
arch-specific purposes. We'll be using them for Branch Target
Identification (a CFI-like hardening feature), which is currently under
review on the mailing list.

There was a trivial conflict in -next for a couple of entries in the
arm64 Kconfig fighting over context, but apart from that it's been
unusually smooth.

Cheers,

Will

  arm64: acpi: fix DAIF manipulation with pNMI (2020-01-22 14:41:22 +0000)

----------------------------------------------------------------
arm64 updates for 5.6

- New architecture features
	* Support for Armv8.5 E0PD, which benefits KASLR in the same way as
	  KPTI but without the overhead. This allows KPTI to be disabled on
	  CPUs that are not affected by Meltdown, even is KASLR is enabled.

	* Initial support for the Armv8.5 RNG instructions, which claim to
	  provide access to a high bandwidth, cryptographically secure hardware
	  random number generator. As well as exposing these to userspace, we
	  also use them as part of the KASLR seed and to seed the crng once
	  all CPUs have come online.

	* Advertise a bunch of new instructions to userspace, including support
	  for Data Gathering Hint, Matrix Multiply and 16-bit floating point.

- Kexec
	* Cleanups in preparation for relocating with the MMU enabled
	* Support for loading crash dump kernels with kexec_file_load()

- Perf and PMU drivers
	* Cleanups and non-critical fixes for a couple of system PMU drivers

- FPU-less (aka broken) CPU support
	* Considerable fixes to support CPUs without the FP/SIMD extensions,
	  including their presence in heterogeneous systems. Good luck finding
	  a 64-bit userspace that handles this.

- Modern assembly function annotations
	* Start migrating our use of ENTRY() and ENDPROC() over to the
	  new-fangled SYM_{CODE,FUNC}_{START,END} macros, which are intended to
	  aid debuggers

- Kbuild
	* Cleanup detection of LSE support in the assembler by introducing
	  'as-instr'

	* Remove compressed Image files when building clean targets

- IP checksumming
	* Implement optimised IPv4 checksumming routine when hardware offload
	  is not in use. An IPv6 version is in the works, pending testing.

- Hardware errata
	* Work around Cortex-A55 erratum #1530923

- Shadow call stack
	* Work around some issues with Clang's integrated assembler not liking
	  our perfectly reasonable assembly code

	* Avoid allocating the X18 register, so that it can be used to hold the
	  shadow call stack pointer in future

- ACPI
	* Fix ID count checking in IORT code. This may regress broken firmware
	  that happened to work with the old implementation, in which case we'll
	  have to revert it and try something else

	* Fix DAIF corruption on return from GHES handler with pseudo-NMIs

- Miscellaneous
	* Whitelist some CPUs that are unaffected by Spectre-v2

	* Reduce frequency of ASID rollover when KPTI is compiled in but
	  inactive

	* Reserve a couple of arch-specific PROT flags that are already used by
	  Sparc and PowerPC and are planned for later use with BTI on arm64

	* Preparatory cleanup of our entry assembly code in preparation for
	  moving more of it into C later on

	* Refactoring and cleanup
