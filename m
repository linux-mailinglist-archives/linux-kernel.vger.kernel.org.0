I don't think that's true. the "_safe" part of
list_for_each_entry_safe ensures that we don't touch the ->next member
of any node after freeing it. So I don't think there's any case where
we could touch freed memory. The list_del still seems like needless
code to me.

I don't follow that either. The empty array declaration (or the
GCC-specific version of it would be  "struct rpmh_request
rpm_msgs[0];") is a flexible array member, meaning the member itself
doesn't take up any space in the struct. So, for instance, it holds
true that &(req->rpm_msgs[0]) == (req + 1). By my reading the existing
code is correct, and your patch just adds a needless pointer
indirection. Check out this wikipedia entry:
