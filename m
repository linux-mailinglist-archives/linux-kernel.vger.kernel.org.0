You are obviously right, there is a huge race condition.

Correct - I've overlooked that.

First, theory:

setting queue->status, reading queue->status, setting 
current->state=TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE are all under the correct spinlock.

(there is an opportunistic read of queue->status without locks, but it 
is retried when the lock got acquired)

setting current->state=RUNNING is outside of any lock.

So as far as current->state is concerned, the lock doesn't exist. And if 
the lock doesn't exist, we must follow the rules applicable for 
set_current_state().

I'll try to check the code this week.

And we should check the remaining wake-queue users, the logic is 
everywhere identical.

For testing? Have you considered just always using the global lock?

Around line 190 is the comment that explains locking & memory ordering.

I have only documented the content of sem_undo and sem_array, but 
neither queue nor current->state :-(
