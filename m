For some more background on why we chose to take this shortcut for now:
Sowjanya was looking at the full-featured implementation and that ended
up being a can of worms. The problem is that there are various inter-
dependencies between the PLLM override and the MC/EMC clocks.

Unfortunately we depend a lot on the explicit ordering of driver probe,
especially during early boot, so this started to get very complicated,
very quickly.

The bottom line was basically that we would need to move a whole bunch
of clocks to register at a very late point in time and support deferred
probe throughout in order to make it all work together nicely. Sowjanya
had a crack at that, and while the system ended up booting, there were a
number of errors from the MC and IOMMU drivers.

At the end, we decided to take a look at that separately because, as was
mentioned earlier, the PLLM override is not used on platforms where the
PMC is locked down, so the existing PLLM override code is going to
continue to work fine on the platforms where it's currently used.
