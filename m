But what do we win with that? Horrors like this:

task A		task B	   	task C

     		arm_timer(A)	arm_timer(A)

do_exit()

		del_timer(A)	del_timer(A)
		no sighand	no_sighand
		 list_del()       list_del()

Guess how well concurrent list deletion works.

We must remove armed timers from the task/signal _before_ dropping sighand,
really.
