This patch updates the PMCs for AMD Zen1 core based processors (Family
17h; Models 01, 08, 10 and 18) to be in accordance with PMCs as
documented in the latest versions of the AMD Processor Programming
Reference [1] and [2].

PMCs added:
fpu_pipe_assignment.dual{0|1|2|3}
fpu_pipe_assignment.total{0|1|2|3}
ls_mab_alloc.dc_prefetcher
ls_mab_alloc.stores
ls_mab_alloc.loads

PMC removed:
ex_ret_cond_misp

Cumulative counts, fpu_pipe_assignment.total and
fpu_pipe_assignment.dual, existed in v1, but did expose port-level
counters.

ex_ret_cond_misp has been removed as it has been removed from the latest
versions of the PPR, and when tested, always seems to sample zero as
tested on a Ryzen 3400G system.

[1]: Processor Programming Reference (PPR) for AMD Family 17h Models
01h,08h, Revision B2 Processors, 54945 Rev 3.03 - Jun 14, 2019.
[2]: Processor Programming Reference (PPR) for AMD Family 17h Model 18h,
Revision B1 Processors, 55570-B1 Rev 3.14 - Sep 26, 2019.
