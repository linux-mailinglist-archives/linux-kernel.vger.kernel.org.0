With py3 the recommended way to install virtual environments is::

   python3 -m venv sphinx-env

This (python3) is what worked for me on RHEL/CentOS (dnf),
archlinux and debian/ubuntu (tested from 16.04 up to 20.04).

I am not familiar with the sphinx-pre-install script but may be
one of you is able to apply such a patch?
