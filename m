Thanks for your comments, this reminds me to think more about the 
effects to users.

After I reviewed the related code in Qemu and VFIO, I think maybe there 
is a problem in current behavior
for the signal path changing case. Qemu has neither recovery nor retry 
code in case that ioctl with
'VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS' command fails, so if the old signal path has been 
disabled on fault of setting
up new path, the corresponding vector may be disabled forever. Following 
is an example from qemu's
vfio_msix_vector_do_use():

         ret = ioctl(vdev->vbasedev.fd, VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS, irq_set);
         g_free(irq_set);
         if (ret) {
             error_report("vfio: failed to modify vector, %d", ret);
         }

I think the singal path before changing should be still working at this 
moment and the caller should keep it
working if the changing fails, so that at least we still have the old 
path instead of no path.

For masking vector case, the 'fd' should be -1, and the interrupt will 
be freed as before this patch.

Thanks for pointing it out, I will fix this in next version.

Sorry for confusing and I do this for a reason,  I will add some more 
comments like this:

Unregistration here is for re-resigtraion later, which will trigger the 
reconnection of irq_bypass producer
and consumer, which in turn calls vmx_update_pi_irte() to update IRTE if 
posted interrupt is in use.
(vmx_update_pi_irte() will modify IRTE based on the information 
retrieved from KVM.)
Whether producer token changed or not, irq_bypass_register_producer() is 
a way (seems the only way) to
update IRTE by VFIO for posted interrupt. The IRTE will be used by IOMMU 
directly to find the target CPU
for an interrupt posted to VM, since hypervisor is bypassed.

Actually, I have explained this in comments above this whole control 
block. I think it is safe and better to
update devid before irq_bypass_unregister_producer() which switches 
interrupt process from posted mode
to remap mode. So, if update fails, the posted interrupt can still work.

Anyway, to producer and consumer,  'trigger' is only a token used for 
pairing them togather.

Thanks,
