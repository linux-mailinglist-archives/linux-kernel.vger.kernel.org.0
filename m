On our Secure pseries platform,  dma address is physical address and this
proposal will help us, use DMA API. 

On our normal pseries platform, dma address is physical address too.
But we do not necessarily need to use the DMA API.  We can use the DMA
API, but our handlers will do the same thing, the generic virtio handlers
would do. If there is an opt-out option; even when dma addr is same as
physical addr, than there will be less code duplication.

Would something like this be better.

(dma_addr_is_phys_addr  && arch_want_to_use_dma_api()) ?
