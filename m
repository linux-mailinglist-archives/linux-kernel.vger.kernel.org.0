Google has started using libabigail to track api changes in AOSP, here's
a patch that updates the ABI file after changing it:
	https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/kernel/common/+/1108662

Note, there are issues with it, and some rough edges, but I think it can
work.

But, it means nothing at module load time, this is only at build-check
time.  At least modversions would prevent module loading in some cases.
