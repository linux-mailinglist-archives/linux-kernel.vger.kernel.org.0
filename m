I think this case is completely different to the implicit fallthrough stuff.
The solution there was simply to add a comment without restructuring the
surrounding code. What your patch does here is actively make the code harder
to understand.

Initialising a static array with a non-zero pattern is a useful idiom and I
don't think we should throw that away just to appease a silly compiler
warning that appears only with non-default build options. Have a look at
the way we use PERF_MAP_ALL_UNSUPPORTED in the Arm PMU code, for example.
