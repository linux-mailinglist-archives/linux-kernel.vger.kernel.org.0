I think this bug hardly can happen.

Or any thread on Y is busy with preemption/irq disabled preventing the
stopper from being scheduled on Y.

Or something is stuck in ttwu() to wake up the stopper on Y due to any
scheduler locks such as pi_lock or rq->lock or something.

I think what you mentioned can happen easily.

Basically we would need information about preemption/irq disabled
sections on Y and scheduler's current activity on every cpu at that time.

Am I missing something?
