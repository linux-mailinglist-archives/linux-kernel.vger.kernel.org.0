It sounded like Chris already answered this, though?  Basically things
aren't hooked up in a way that this line can be turned safely turned
off in rk3288 with the current state of the world.  Chris says that
there's an ordering problem where we've got to turn off PD_VIO
_before_ we turn off SIDDQ.  ...but PD_VIO is a power domain that
contains much more than just eDP.  So if we truly wanted to try to
solve this we'd need to come up with a way to make sure PD_VIO got all
the way off and then turn this off only afterwards.

...and right now on rk3288 it looks like we never actually turn off
PD_VIO while the system is running.
