Oh, sorry, that is my oversight. It seems that not only the other size 
introductions but also introductions on Kconfig should be corrected. 
Thank you very much and is the following modification OK?

The chunk size in KB for dmesg(oops/panic). It **MUST** be a multiple of 4.

It is an oops/panic counter too. How about this?

It means that it's OOPS/PANIC for the 16th time since the first booting.
