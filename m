Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: proc.txt: emphasize that iowait cannot be relied on

CPU "iowait" time in /proc/stat does not work on my laptop.

I saw the documentation mention several problems with "iowait".  However
each problem appeared to be qualified.  It gave me the impression I could
probably account for each problem.  My impression was wrong.

There are a couple of writeups explaining the specific problem I had.[1][2]

[1] "[RFC PATCH 0/8] rework iowait accounting", 2014-06-26:
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/53ABE28F.6010402@jp.fujitsu.com/

[2] A recent writeup by myself:
    https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/517757/my-basic-assumption-about-system-iowait-does-not-hold/527836#527836

This might just be me.  Partly, my small knowledge about the scheduler
allowed for false assumptions.  But I think we can emphasize more strongly
how broken iowait is on SMP.  Overall, I aim to make it sound much scarier
to analyze iowait.  I add some precise details, and also some
anxiety-inducing vagueness :-).

[Detailed reasons for the specific points I included:]

1. Let us say that "iowait _can_ be massively under-accounted".  It is
likely to remain true in future.  At least since v4.16, the
under-accounting problem seems very exposed on non-virtual, multi-CPU
systems.  In theory the wheel might turn again; this exposure might be
reduced in future.  But even on v4.15, I can reproduce the problem using
CPU affinity.

2. Point to NO_HZ_IDLE, as a good hint towards i) the nature of the problem
and ii) and how widespread it is.  To give a more comprehensive picture,
also point to NO_HZ_FULL and VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE.

Setting down my exact scenario would require a lot of specifics.  That
would be going beyond the point.  We could link to one of the writeups as
well, but I don't think we need to.

3. My own "use case" did not expose the problem when I ran it on a virtual
machine.  Even using my CPU affinity method.[2]  I haven't tracked down
why.  This is a significant qualification to point 1.  Explicitly
acknowledge this.  It's a pain, but it makes the main point easier to
verify, and hence more credible.

(I suspect this is common at least to small test VMs.  It appears true
for both a Fedora 30 VM (5.1.x) and a Debian 9 VM (4.9.x).  I also tried
some different storage options, virtio-blk v.s. virtio-scsi v.s. isilogic.)

-  So, the iowait is not reliable by reading from /proc/stat.
