As per [1], I'd really like to better understand the allocation patterns 
that lead to such a sparsely-occupied address space to begin with, given 
that the rbtree allocator is supposed to try to maintain locality as far 
as possible, and the rcaches should further improve on that. Are you 
also frequently cycling intermediate-sized buffers which are smaller 
than 64MB but still too big to be cached?  Are there a lot of 
non-power-of-two allocations?

Even if the general change did prove reasonable, this IOVA allocator is 
not owned by the DMA API, so entirely removing the option of strict 
size-alignment feels a bit uncomfortable. Personally I'd replace the 
bool argument with an actual alignment value to at least hand the 
authority out to individual callers.

Furthermore, even in DMA API terms, is anyone really ever going to 
bother tuning that config? Since iommu-dma is supposed to be a 
transparent layer, arguably it shouldn't behave unnecessarily 
differently from CMA, so simply piggy-backing off CONFIG_CMA_ALIGNMENT 
would seem logical.

Robin.
