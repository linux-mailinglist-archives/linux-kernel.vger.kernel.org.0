IIRC currently fwupd does two reads of total 128 bytes from the active
NVM. Is that really slowing down fwupd startup significantly?

Indeed kernel has this information but I'm bit hesitant to add new
attributes if that same information is already available to the
userspace rather easily. IMHO we can always add this to the driver later
as we learn new NVM formats that require more parsing from fwupd side
slowing it down considerably.
