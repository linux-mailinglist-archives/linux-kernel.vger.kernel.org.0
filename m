snprintf() to a temporary buffer, and memcpy() to the final destination.
These are all fairly small buffers (most are single integer values),
so the overhead should be minimal, right?

In fact the two largest strings are already formatted in a temporary
buffer, so there is no reason ceph_vxattrcb_layout() cannot just use
snprintf() now.

Or perhaps this can use the existing seq_*() interface in some form?

BTW, while at it, please get rid of the casts when calling snprintf(), and
use the correct format specifiers instead.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
