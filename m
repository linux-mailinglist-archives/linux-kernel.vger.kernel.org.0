AFAICT if latency_nice is really used for scheduler hints to provide
latency requirements, then the worst that can happen is the user can
request to have all the created tasks get least latency (which might not
even be possible). Hence, unless we bias priority or vruntime, I don't see
the DoS possibility with latency_nice.

Being conservative for future and considering that only Admin may make
correct decision, I do think to not allow non-root user to give -ve values
for latency_nice.

NICE don't allow reducing the task_nice value even if the value has been
increase by the same user in the past. From my understandings, this don't
make sense much for the latency_nice and user should be free to choose any
value in the range [0,19].
