I think it's just at startup, e.g. if you're watching movie, audio is in sy=
nc,=20
it's just that first second or so is silent.

Ok, but how to communicate that fact to I2S driver then? BSP driver solves=

that by using different compatible, but as I said before, I2S cores are not=
=20
really different, so this seems wrong.
