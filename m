That's yet another area of wreckage which nobody every looked at.

Well, test code is always reasonable, but you have to be aware that code
coverage is a really hard to solve problem with a code base as complex
as the kernel.

That's why we want the sections and the annotation. If something calls
out of a noinstr section into a regular text section and the call is not
annotated at the call site, then objtool can complain and tell you. What
Peter and I came up with looks like this:

noinstr foo()
	do_protected(); <- Safe because in the noinstr section

	instr_begin();	<- Marks the begin of a safe region, ignored
        		   by objtool

        do_stuff();     <- All good   

        instr_end();    <- End of the safe region. objtool starts
			   looking again

        do_other_stuff();  <- Unsafe because do_other_stuff() is
        		      not protected
and:

noinstr do_protected()
        bar();		<- objtool will complain here

See?

That's something we need to figure out and decide on. Some of this stuff
sureley wants to be in the noinstr section. Other things might end up
still being explicitely annotated, but that should be the exception not
the rule.

That might help, but is obviously racy as hell.
