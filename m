I agree that the enums are more self-descriptive. My problem with it is
that there are 5 values. I wanted to check how they were handled
and neither 'con_matched' nor 'con_failed' were later used.

I though how to improve it. And I ended with feeling that the enum
did more harm then good. -E??? codes are a bit less descriptive
but there are only two. The meaning can be explained easily by
a comment above the function.

If you want to keep the enum then please handle the return values
by switch(). Or make it clear that all possible return values
are handled properly.

Best Regards,
Petr
