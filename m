All, I was asked to take a look at the original latency_nice patchset. First, to clarify objectives, Oracle is not 
interested in trading throughput for latency. What we found is that the DB has specific tasks which do very little but 
need to do this as absolutely quickly as possible, ie extreme latency sensitivity. Second, the key to latency reduction 
in the task wakeup path seems to be limiting variations of "idle cpu" search. The latter particularly interests me as an 
example of "platform size based latency" which I believe to be important given all the varying size VMs and containers.

Parth, I've been using your v3 patchset as the basis of an investigation into the measurable effects of short-circuiting 
this search. I'm not quite ready to put anything out, but the patchset is working well. The only feedback I have is that 
currently non-root can set the value negative which is inconsistent with 'nice' and I would think a security hole.
