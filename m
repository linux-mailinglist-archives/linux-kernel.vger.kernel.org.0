Thank you for the background. I appreciate it.

There are some entries on the 8MM which can be used the same way as
the 8MM.  I have been able to get USB OTG working using the 8MQ's GPC
table.

Until sometime better is available, would you entertain a limited use
of the 8MQ's GPC where the device tree nodes only contain a limited
number of entries (like USB OTG) where we can re-use the similar
functions 8MQ without expanding the driver functions?  I know its not
ideal, but it would be a temporary solution unless you think the
upstream power domain support is coming quickly.  I looked through the
mailing list history and it looked like there were some attempts about
6 months ago, then it appeared to stop.

Once the newer driver is available upstream, we could then remove GPC
references from the 8MM device tree and point it to the new driver.

It would increase some limited functionality for the short term.  I
know Leonard has been working on the DDRC modifications and power
reduction.  I have been trying to use them, but unsuccessful so far.

What about doing it in the U-Boot stage if Linux isn't an option and
ATF isn't accepting them?
