Ok, let me start from the top.

When the kernel boots, timer_probe() is called (via time_init()) way
before any of the initcalls are called in do_initcalls().

In systems with CONFIG_OF, of_platform_default_populate_init() gets
called at arch_initcall_sync() level.
of_platform_default_populate_init() is what kicks off creating
platform devices from device nodes in DT. However, if the struct
device_node that corresponds to a device node in DT has OF_POPULATED
flag set, a platform device is NOT created for it (because it's
considered already "populated"/taken care of).

When a timer driver registers using TIMER_OF_DECLARE(), the driver's
init code is called from timer_probe() on the struct device_node that
corresponds to the timer device node. At this point the timer is
already "probed". If you don't mark this device node with
OF_POPULATED, at arch_initcall_sync() it's going to have a pointless
struct platform_device created that's just using up memory and
pointless.

So my patch sets the OF_POPULATED flag for all timer device_node's
that are successfully probed from timer_probe().

If a timer driver doesn't use TIMER_OF_DECLARE() and just registers as
a platform device, the driver init function won't be called from
timer_probe() and it's corresponding devices won't have OF_POPULATED
set in their device_node. So platform_devices will be created for them
and they'll probe as normal platform devices. This is why my change
doesn't break drivers/clocksource/ingenic-timer.c.

Btw, this is no different from what irqchip does with IRQCHIP_DECLARE.

Hope that clears it up.

Thanks,
Saravana
