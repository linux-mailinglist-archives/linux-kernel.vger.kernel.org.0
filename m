Subject: [PATCH v3] locking/qspinlock: Fix inaccessible URL of MCS lock paper
Date:   Tue,  7 Jan 2020 12:49:14 -0500
Message-Id: <20200107174914.4187-1-longman@redhat.com>

It turns out that the URL of the MCS lock paper listed in the source
code is no longer accessible. I did got question about where the paper
was. This patch updates the URL to BZ 206115 which contains a copy of
the paper from

  https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/papers/1991_TOCS_synch.pdf
