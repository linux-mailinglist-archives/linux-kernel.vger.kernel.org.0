The top 32 bits of a 64-bit register holding an int are undefined.  Take
as example

  int x = 42;
  x = ~x;

which may put ffff_ffff_ffff_ffd5 into the reg, not 0000_0000_ffff_ffd5
as you might expect or want.  For tw instructions this makes no difference
(they only look at the low 32 bits anyway); for td insns, it does.

Sure, it isn't defined what types you can pass to that macro.  Another
thing that makes inline functions much saner to use.

But see my comment there about the compiler knowing all code after an
unconditional trap is dead.
