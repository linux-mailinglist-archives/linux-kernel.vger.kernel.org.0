That's not true. Even on x86 without iommu the DMA address space can
be different from the physical address space. That could be still just
a simple addition/subtraction by constant, but still, the two are
explicitly defined without any guarantees about a simple mapping
between one or another existing.

See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/DMA-API.txt

"A CPU cannot reference a dma_addr_t directly because there may be
translation between its physical
address space and the DMA address space."

We don't need to limit this to virtio devices only. In fact I actually
foresee this having a use case with the emulated USB host controller,
which isn't a virtio device.

That said, I deliberately referred to virtio to keep the scope of the
problem in control. If there is a solution that could work without
such assumption, I'm more than open to discuss it, of course.

The IOMMU doesn't need to exist physically, though. After all, guest
memory may not be physically contiguous in the host already, but with
your definition of DMA address we would refer to it as contiguous. As
per my understanding of the DMA address, anything that lets the DMA
master access the target memory would qualify and there would be no
need for an IOMMU in between.

Exactly. The very specific first scenario that we want to start with
is allocating host memory through virtio-gpu and using that memory
both as output of a video decoder and as input (texture) to Virgil3D.
The memory needs to be specifically allocated by the host as only the
host can know the requirements for memory allocation of the video
decode accelerator hardware.
