Can you please respond to this? For the clock controller example, we
need to explicitly override the implied dependency because... see
subsequent comments below.
Can we at least agree to using "depends-on" as an override when the
existing bindings don't properly define the mandatory dependencies? If
it'll make you happy, we can even make it "does-not-depend-on".

That might be debatable for the example you gave, but it's certainly
not debatable for some clock controllers (CC) that have cyclic
dependencies. Only one of them can function without the other.

In the cases I'm thinking of, this has nothing to do with the kernel.
CC1 supplies 50 clocks, 5 of which need input from CC2. CC2 supplies
10 clocks, all of them are dependent on 4 inputs from CC1. CC2 can
never function without CC1. But in DT, they'll have a cyclic
dependency if you go by clock bindings they list.

The way I define depends-on, pinctrl will never be a dependency for
this specific device (because you are saying it can function without
it). The driver decides if it wants to -EPROBE_DEFER or not depending
on the kernel. But I've beaten this horse to death. So, moving
along...

Now you are just going back to listing the examples I gave for why we
need "depends-on" and why existing bindings aren't mandatory
dependencies. Don't know if I should laugh or cry :)
