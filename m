Just for clarification, this corresponds to
0d55c668b218a1db68b5044bce4de74e1bd0f0c8 upstream.

Please clarify the scope of "our platform".
(Only you, or your company, or every individual using this chip?)


First, SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES is not the property of the hardware.
Rather, it is about the OOB layout, in other words, this parameter
is defined by software.

For example, U-Boot supports the Denali NAND driver.
The SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES is a user-configurable parameter:
https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/v2019.10-rc3/drivers/mtd/nand/raw/Kconfig#L112


Your platform works with a zero in the SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES register
because the NAND chip on the board was initialized with a zero
set to the SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES register.

If the NAND chip had been initialized with 8
set to the SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES register, it would have
been working with 8 to the SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES.

The Boot ROM is the only (semi-)software that is unconfigurable by users,
so the value of SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES should be aligned with
the boot ROM.
I recommend you to check the spec of the boot ROM.

(The maintainer of the platform, Dihn is CC'ed,
so I hope he will jump in)


Second, I doubt 0 is a good value for SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES.

As explained in commit log, SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES==0 means
the OOB is used for ECC without any offset.
So, the BBM marked in the factory will be destroyed.

git-bisect is a general solution to pin point the problem.

BTW, if you end up with hacking the clock frequency, something is already wrong.

denali->clk_rate, denali->clk_x_rate should be 50MHz, 200MHz, respectively.

If not, please check the clock driver and your DT.
