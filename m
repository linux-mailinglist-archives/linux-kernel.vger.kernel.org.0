Yes.

If we want to use it for other levels, the autosectionlabel extension
would need to be modified to work on an hierarchical way, creating an
unique label that would contain the entire hierarchy, starting from
the filename.

Also, ideally, it should also handle cross-reference locally, searching
first for a reference at the same hierarchical level, then at level - 1
and so on.

I suspect that, even with that, we may still have some troubles, as
right now some files may have explicitly defined a reference like
that, but those would likely be easy to fix.

Thanks,
Mauro
