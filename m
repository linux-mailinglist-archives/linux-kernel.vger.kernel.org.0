Sorry, I meant that IRQs are disabled here.

The C wrapper calls __uaccess_ttbr0_enable(), which calls
local_irq_save() and local_irq_restore(). Those are pointless in the
bowels of the entry code, and potentially expensive if IRQ prio masking
is in use.

I'd rather not add more out-of-line C code calls here right now as I'd
prefer to factor out the logic to C in a better way.

That sounds fine to me,

Thanks,
