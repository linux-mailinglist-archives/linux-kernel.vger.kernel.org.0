The are two reasons I decided to make minor changes to fix the
performance regression.

First, being able to send the patch to the various stable branches once
merged. For people working with many CD drives attached to one station,
this is a pretty big deal, so I tried to keep the patch simple. It fixes
the regression introduced in another commit.

Secondly, I don't have the hardware to test sophisticated or old setups,
like some of the issues linked from my patch. I have SATA CD drives with
USB->SATA bridges, no IDE, no PATA, etc. So the testing I can do is
relatively limited.

Perhaps I or someone else can work on removing the usage of the locks,
but as it stands I think this addresses the performance issue present in
the current kernel, and removing locks and the associated testing
required with that is something I am not entirely comfortable doing.

Cheers,
Merlijn
