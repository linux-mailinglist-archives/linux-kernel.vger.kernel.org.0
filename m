Please check the implementation of mtd_is_bitflip(). You'll probably
figure out what I am saying.

I mean: what is the usual size of dmesg? I don't get why you need it to
be ie. a multiple of 2k. It probably is actually, I don't know if there
is a standard. But if dmesg_size is eg 3k, just skip the end of the
partially written page and start writing at the next page?

Why not.

It is useful to alert the user! It means something went wrong while
everything seems fine.

Just because of busy? I don't get it.

I'm okay with the idea of trying to write the other chunks though:

	while (remaining_chunk) {
		ret =3D mtd_write()
		if (ret) {
			alert-user;
			continue;
		}
	}
