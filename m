I would like for the series to get into linux-next sooner than later,
and spend some time there.  

I am _slightly_ more optimistic than Rob that sitting in linux-next for
an extended period might reveal any latent issues, so I would like for
the series to be in linux-next for an extended period of time.  (Yes,
my understanding is that Linus does not like patches to be in linux-next
if they are not targeted for the next merge window, but I prefer that
this patch series spend as much time in linux-next as possible).

I have been waiting for the changes to settle down before bringing up
the issue of devicetree overlays.  Now that the code seems to be
settling down, I need to look at how these changes impact overlays.
So I do not think the patches will be ready for a Linus pull request
until overlays are considered.
