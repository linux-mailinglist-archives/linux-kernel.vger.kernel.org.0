I am testing an idea that just do,

lockdep_assert_held_write(&orig->vm_mm->mmap_sem);
*new = data_race(*orig);

The idea is that as long as we have the exclusive mmap_sem held in all paths
(auditing indicated so), no writer should be able to mess up our vm_area_struct
except the "shared.rb" field which has no harm.
