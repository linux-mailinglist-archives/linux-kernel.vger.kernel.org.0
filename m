I see. It was too cryptic for me. I did not get the proper meaning
and context ;-)

Yup, I could take it via printk.git.

Yeah, it makes perfect sense to me.

OK, if you are the embedded guy and you would appreciate the config
then let's have it. Just please add it by a separate patch,
ideally with some numbers.

I remeber LWN articles about shrinking the kernel for embeded systems
and that every kB was important.

Is this really tested? do_test() function uses buffer for 256 characters.
There are some consistency checks. But any of your test string
is not truncated by the size of the buffer. Do I miss anything, please?

This sounds like a serious bug. Are your aware of any still
existing %p extension that causes this?

Yes, it is not a big deal. But I would still prefer to
understand what is tested. And it is better to have
more tests focused on different aspects than a single
magic one.

This made me to remember the long discussion about filtering kernel
pointers, see
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1506816410-10230-1-git-send-email-me@tobin.cc

It was basically about that %p might leak information. %pK failed
because it did not force people to remove the dangerous %p calls.
It ended with hashing %p to actually force people to convert %p
into something more useful and safe.

IMHO, the most extreme was a wish to get rid of %p and %pa
completely, see
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CA+55aFwac2BzgZs-X1_VhekkuGfuLqNui2+2DbvLiDyptS-rXQ@mail.gmail.com

I do not think that exposing ERR_PTR values might be dangerous.
Well, it would be great to confirm this by some security guys.
Anyway, I do not think that it is a good idea to make %p
more useful again.

I would print the hashed pointer value when the value passed
to %pe is out of range.
