The Trenchboot project focus on boot security has led to the enabling of
the Linux kernel to be directly invocable by the x86 Dynamic Launch
instruction(s) for establishing a Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement
(DRTM). The dynamic launch will be initiated by a boot loader with
associated support added to it, for example the first targeted boot
loader will be GRUB2. An integral part of establishing the DRTM involves
measuring everything that is intended to be run (kernel image, initrd,
etc) and everything that will configure that kernel to run (command
line, boot params, etc) into specific PCRs, the DRTM PCRs (17-22), in
the TPM. Another key aspect is the dynamic launch is rooted in hardware.
On Intel this is done using the GETSEC instruction set provided by
Intel's TXT and the SKINIT instruction provided by AMD's AMD-V.
Information on these technologies can be readily found online.

To enable the kernel to be launched by GETSEC or SKINIT, a stub must be
built into the setup section of the compressed kernel to handle the
specific state that the late launch process leaves the BSP. This is a
lot like the EFI stub that is found in the same area. Also this stub
must measure everything that is going to be used as early as possible.
This stub code and subsequent code must also deal with the specific
state that the late launch leaves the APs in.

A quick note on terminology. The larger open source project itself is
called Trenchboot, which is hosted on Github (links below). The kernel
feature enabling the use of the x86 technology is referred to as "Secure
Launch" within the kernel code. As such the prefixes sl_/SL_ or
slaunch/SLAUNCH will be seen in the code. The stub code discussed above
is referred to as the SL stub.

The basic flow is:

 - Entry from the late launch jumps to the SL stub
 - SL stub fixes up the world on the BSP
 - For TXT, SL stub wakes the APs, fixes up their worlds
 - For TXT, APs are left halted waiting for an NMI to wake them
 - SL stub jumps to startup_32
 - SL main runs to measure configuration and module information into the
   DRTM PCRs. It also locates the TPM event log.
 - Kernel boot proceeds normally from this point.
 - During early setup, slaunch_setup() runs to finish some validation
   and setup tasks.
 - The SMP bringup code is modified to wake the waiting APs. APs vector
   to rmpiggy and start up normally from that point.
 - Kernel boot finishes booting normally
 - SL securityfs module is present to allow reading and writing of the
   TPM event log.

Outstanding:

 - Currently Secure Launch only supports TXT, though there is an AMD
   version is in progress.
 - The compressed kernel TPM code includes a CRB interface
   implementation but is untested due to inability to locate a system
   with TXT and a TPM accessible with the CRB interface
 - There is a known crash that is difficult to reproduce and is unclear
   how the secure launch code is causing the crash. Thread on it here:
