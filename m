So this means the local device says it can do 1000Mbps.

The link peer can also do 1000Mbps.

Yet they have decided to do 100Mbps. 

We need to understand Why? The generic PHY driver would not do this on
its own. So i'm thinking something has poked a PHY register with some
value, and this patch is causing it to be over written.

Please can you use mii-tool -v -v to dump the PHY registers in each
case.

Thanks
