Yes, even with CONFIG_PREEMPT, Linux has no guarantees of latency for
any task regardless of priority. If you have latency requirements, then
you need to apply the PREEMPT_RT patch (which may soon make it to
mainline this year!), which spin locks and bh wont stop a task from
scheduling (unless they need the same lock).

Well, when I use function tracing, I start all of them, analyze the
trace, then the functions I don't care about (usually spin locks and
other utils), I add to the set_ftrace_notrace file,  which keeps them
from being part of the trace. I keep doing this until I find a set of
functions that doesn't hurt overhead as much and gives me enough
information to know what is happening. It also helps to enable all or
most events (at least scheduling events).
