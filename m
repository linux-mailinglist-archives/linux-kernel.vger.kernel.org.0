It could still be useful to have -Woverride-init/initializer-overrides =
in W=3D1
for people only running W=3D1 to catch some real developer mistakes. W=3D2=

might be too noisy to start with.

The pragma might be fine for Clang, although it seems a bit overkill.
Then, it needs to add something for GCC=E2=80=99s "override-init" as =
well.
If that mm_init.c grows in the future to have more structs, it may =
become
more desirable to use =E2=80=9Cpragma=E2=80=9D to only disable this =
particular struct.

I am running this every day and seeing this every time, so definitely
appreciate disabling it in the kernel itself if not adding too much work
for maintainers. See the end of this file for my current filtering,

Yes, I did also mention GCC will also warn those (from -Woverride-init) =
but
did not include in the warning output which seems redundant.
