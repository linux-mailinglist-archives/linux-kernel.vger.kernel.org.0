I'd prefer to leave the dev_groups in the platform driver code, as no
one should have to do this crazy "sub structure definition" that
platform drivers seem to love to do.

Here's the patch that I currently have on top of Dmitry's that is
getting run through 0-day right now.

I'll resend the whole patch series once it passes (hopefully tomorrow).

thanks,

Subject: [PATCH 02/13] platform: add a dev_groups pointer to struct
 platform_driver

As the driver core now provides the ability to directly add/remove
device groups when a driver is bound/unbound to a device, just pass that
pointer along to the driver core.

This allows us to fix up platform drivers to not need to create/remove
groups "by hand" anymore.
