Thanks for testing the patch! Let's try to figure that out...

I'm a bit confused, but this might be because I'm not very familiar with
the MSM8998 laptops. It does not seem to have display in mainline yet,
so do you have a link to all the patches you are using at the moment?

Judging from the patches I was able to find, the Lenovo Miix 630 is
using a DSI to eDP bridge.
Isn't the panel managed by the bridge driver in that case?

struct msm_dsi contains:
	/*
	 * panel/external_bridge connected to dsi bridge output, only one of the
	 * two can be valid at a time
	 */
	struct drm_panel *panel;
	struct drm_bridge *external_bridge;

So if you have "external_bridge" set in your case, "panel" should be NULL.
I have only moved code that uses msm_dsi->panel, so my patch really
shouldn't make any difference for you.

Am I confusing something here?

Thanks,
Stephan
