Hi James,

OK, I will make the change incremental.

Makes sense, I will fix it.

BTW, I root caused it, there were two trivial errors:
1. In "arm64, mm: transitional tables"
int i = pgd_index(addr);
In trans_table_copy_*:
should be: pte_index(), pmd_index(), pud_index(), accordingly.
2. In trans_table_create_copy()
pgd_offset_k(PAGE_OFFSET) should be: mm_init.pgd

This is until a new kernel module is loaded, I do not think this is safe to do.

In my opinion 2M per 1 GB is a fair trade off for a faster kexec
performance. Unlike with crash kexec for which we do not add any
memory useage, the kernel does not have to be all the time in memory,
but can be loaded by user before reboot. If machine is so scare on
memory resources that 2M per 1G matters, user simply won't keep new
kernel in memory until it is actually needed.

I understand that ARM64 is about to get hot-remove feature, but what I
am saying is that my feature does not introduce new problem because
the current kexec code assumes that kernel memory is not movable
(array of sparse physical source dest addresses in kimage->head). It
is possible to offline and hot-remove only memory that can be freed by
page migration, the pages that were allocated for kexec kernel are not
one of them.

Currently we have two fitImages for this system in development: one
that has a bare minimal userland, only ~40 packages, and another has a
more complete userland. So, my first experiment shows the data from
this first bare minimum ftImage, the second experiment from the second
more complete fitImage. As I stated in cover letter, kexec time is
proportional to the size of the image and this series fixes this
scalability issue by making relocation  ~20 times faster.
