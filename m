I am curious about CPU2. Does scheduler need to allocate memory?

We have got several lockdep reports about possible deadlocks between
console_lock and port_lock caused by printk() called from console
code.

First note that they have been there for years. They were well hidden
until 4.11 released in April 2017. Where the commit
f975237b76827956fe13e ("printk: use printk_safe buffers in printk")
allowed recursive printk() and lockdep.

We believe that these deadlocks are really hard to hit. Console
drivers call printk() only in very critical and rare situations.
This is why nobody invested too much time into fixing these
so far.

There are basically three possibilities:

1. Do crazy exercises with locks all around the kernel to
   avoid the deadlocks. It is usually not worth it. And
   it is a "whack a mole" approach.

2. Use printk_deferred() in problematic code paths. It is
   a "whack a mole" approach as well. And we would end up
   with printk_deferred() used almost everywhere.

3. Always deffer the console handling in printk(). This would
   help also to avoid soft lockups. Several people pushed
   against this last few years because it might reduce
   the chance to see the message in case of system crash.

As I said, there has finally been agreement to always do
the offload few weeks ago. John Ogness is working on it.
So we might have the systematic solution for these deadlocks
rather sooner than later.

Feel free to ask John to CC you on the patches if you want
to help with review.

Petr
