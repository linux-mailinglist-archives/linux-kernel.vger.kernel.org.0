If that is the case, I assume that ACPI probing will also be
problematic for kernels that will be running on systems that have the
SGX accelerator cards that Intel has announced in them.

We haven't seen a solid technical description regarding how SGX
functionality is to be surfaced via these cards.  However, since the
SDM/SGX specification indicates that multiple PRM/EPC's are supported,
the logical assumption would be that each card would be surfaced as a
separate EPC's.

The focus of this driver will be largely cloud based environments and
the accelerator cards are designed to fill the gap until multi-socket
SGX support is available, which has been 'real soon now' for about
three years.  So it would seem to be a requirement for the driver to
deal with these cards if it is to be relevant.

It isn't relevant to these conversations but there will be a version
of this driver supported that runs on non-FLC platforms and that will
support full hardware root of trust via launch enclaves.

Have a good evening.
