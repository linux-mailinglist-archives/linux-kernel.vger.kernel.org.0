But we can skip those pages when onlining and keep them in the offline
state right? We do not poison offlined pages.

There is state stored in the struct page. In other words this shouldn't
be really different from HWPoison pages. I cannot find the code that is
doing that and maybe we don't handle that. But we cannot simply online
hwpoisoned page. Offlining the range will not make a broken memory OK
all of the sudden. And your usecase sounds similar to me.

I am not sure I follow. So you exclude those pages when onlining?

I will have a look, but just to quick question. try_remove_memory would
fail if the range is offline (via user interface) but there are still some
pages in the driver Offline state?

I am not sure I follow. Maybe my original question was confusing. Let me
ask again. Why do we need to hook into __put_page?

Yes, that would be a better fit.
