Yes, you are right. We observed this issue when we got two consecutive
reboots with a kernel panic: After the first reboot the pstore was able
to parse the saved data, but after the second we got a part of the
previous compressed message and the new compressed message with the
ramoops message header at the middle of the file. 

According to our analysis the same issue can occur if we get more
than (rampoops.mem_size/ramoops.record_size) kernel oops during work.

We would like to see this changes in the LTS kernel releases. Could you
please point me the manual about propagation such fixes?
