Ok.

Whatever works best for you and Jon.

I'm keeping a tree with the remaining patches on the top of
driver-core-next at:

	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/log/?h=abi_patches_v4.2

I'll rebase it on the top of yours as new patches get merged there, or if
I develop more patches related to it (I may try to fix the ReST issues with
the files at ABI/testing if I have some spare time).

Note that it contains the RFC patches for parsing ABI files as-is,
with ReST markups on them, if needed.

If you want to pick the hole thing including the RFC ones, there's one patch 
there with probably needs to be either split and/or submitted to ABI file authors:

Thanks,
