I'd like to clarify the logic for the case when a common algorithm
does not exist.  None of the TPM allocated banks are known by the
kernel.  If the hash algorithm of the boot_aggregate represents not
only that of the digest included in the measurement list, but also of
the TPM PCR bank read, what should happen?  Should the boot aggregate
be 0's, like in the case when there isn't a TPM?

thanks,

Mimi
