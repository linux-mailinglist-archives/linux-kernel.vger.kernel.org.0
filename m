I just ran into some "32-bit KVM doesn't expose all the ID
registers to userspace via the ONE_REG API" issues today.
I don't know if they'd be reasonable as something to include
in this patchset or if they're unrelated.

Anyway, missing stuff I have noticed specifically:
 * MVFR2
 * ID_MMFR4
 * ID_ISAR6

More generally I would have expected all these 32-bit registers
to exist and read-as-zero for the purpose of the ONE_REG APIs,
because that's what the architecture says is supposed to happen
and it means we have compatibility and QEMU doesn't gradually
build up lots of "kernel doesn't support this yet" conditionals...
I think we get this right for 64-bit KVM, but can we do it for
32-bit as well?

thanks
