The trouble with doing that (checking the HV bit) is that KVM does not
expect to see the HV bit set on an interrupt that occurred while we
were in the guest, and if it is set, it indicates a serious problem,
i.e. that an interrupt occurred while we were in the code that
transitions from host context to guest context, or from guest context
to host context.  In those cases we don't know how much of the
transition has been completed and therefore whether we have guest
values or host values in the CPU registers (GPRs, FPRs/VSRs, SPRs).
If we do see HV set then KVM reports a severe error to userspace which
should cause userspace to terminate the guest.

Therefore the UV should *always* have the HV bit clear in HSRR1/SRR1
when transitioning to KVM.
