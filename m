Thanks, tested added Jiri's Acked-by, applied, added this note:

Committer testing:

After aplying the patch we get:

  [acme@quaco ~]$ perf record -b -e cycles date
  WARNING: Kernel address maps (/proc/{kallsyms,modules}) are restricted,
  check /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict and /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid.

  Samples in kernel functions may not be resolved if a suitable vmlinux
  file is not found in the buildid cache or in the vmlinux path.

  Samples in kernel modules won't be resolved at all.

  If some relocation was applied (e.g. kexec) symbols may be misresolved
  even with a suitable vmlinux or kallsyms file.

  Mon 23 Sep 2019 11:00:59 AM -03
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.005 MB perf.data (14 samples) ]
  [acme@quaco ~]$ perf evlist -v
  cycles:u: size: 112, { sample_period, sample_freq }: 4000, sample_type: IP|TID|TIME|PERIOD|BRANCH_STACK, read_format: ID, disabled: 1, inherit: 1, exclude_kernel: 1, exclude_hv: 1, mmap: 1, comm: 1, freq: 1, enable_on_exec: 1, task: 1, sample_id_all: 1, exclude_guest: 1, mmap2: 1, comm_exec: 1, ksymbol: 1, bpf_event: 1, branch_sample_type: ANY
  [acme@quaco ~]$

That warning about restricted kernel maps will be suppressed in a follow
up patch, as perf_event_attr.exclude_kernel is set, i.e. no samples for
the kernel will be taken and thus no need for those maps
