Right.
Perhaps a NODEMASK_ALLOC() failure should just result in a quick exit/error.
If we can't allocate a node mask, it is unlikely we will be able to allocate
a/any huge pages.  And, the system must be extremely low on memory and there
are likely other bigger issues.

There have been discussions elsewhere about discontinuing the use of
NODEMASK_ALLOC() and just putting the mask on the stack.  That may be
acceptable here as well.

Yes.
I will clean up with an updated series after more feedback.
