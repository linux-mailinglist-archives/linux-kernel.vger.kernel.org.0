HI all,

Sorry I didn=E2=80=99t jump in here sooner. Just a bit of additional =
background info to what Thomas and Alexios have already provided below:

As Thomas mentioned in another part of this thread, the identifiers for =
the GNU family of licenses was changed as of v3.0 of the SPDX License =
List in Dec 2017. See =
https://spdx.org/news/news/2018/01/license-list-30-released for a =
explanation and =
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/identify-licenses-clearly.html for the =
impetus of the change. (Note, the SPDX License List has its own =
versioning separate from the SPDX Spec.)  We don=E2=80=99t change the =
license identifiers lightly and have only done so for very specific and =
limited reasons, so you can be sure there was a LOT of discussion over =
this change. Unfortunately, the lengthy discussion happened to coincide =
with the beginning of the work here on using the SPDX identifiers in the =
kernel. In a perfect world, we would have completed that change before =
you all started this, but sometimes things don=E2=80=99t go according to =
best timing!

This is correct. It would be nice if any new identifiers used the =
current ones. If the old identifiers get updated as other patches are =
done to those files or something organic like that, that would be great, =
but no rush. We=E2=80=99ve got plenty to focus on with getting the =
identifiers in there, sorting out the =E2=80=9Cmessy=E2=80=9D files and =
so on!

Thanks again for all the work on this!
