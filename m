That program can't be some userspace application, because it will have to make
changes to the hardware and the kernel will not know that things have changed
under its feet. That leaves the option of the bootloader or some other kernel
module doing the changes.

If you have another kernel module that knows how to change clocks, that should
be implemented using the common clocks infrastructure, at which time you can
put it in the DT as the clock provider for the pixelclock.

If the bootloader does the changes, then the bootloader should edit the DT and
set the correct value for the pixel clock. Regardless, with your change and on
your platform the user can request any resolution and the driver will silently
fail to set that resolution.

One other problem is the one Robin raised, where the kernel is compiled for
multiple platforms, like what various Linux distributions do. That kernel will
either work on other SoC or not, depending on what CONFIG_ARCH_LAYERSCAPE is
set to.

In summary, for this patch, it's a NAK. There are proper ways of achieving what
you need, but this patch is not.
