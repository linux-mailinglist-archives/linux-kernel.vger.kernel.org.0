just to confirm that I understand this correctly:
even the VRX200 SoC only has one physical reset controller?
instead of a contiguous register area (let's say: 0x10 to 0x1c) it
uses four separate registers:
- 0x10 for asserting/deasserting/pulsing the first 32 reset lines
- 0x14 for the status of the first 32 reset lines
- 0x48 for asserting/deasserting/pulsing the second 32 reset lines
- 0x28 for the status of the second 32 reset lines

I'm not surprised that we got some of the IP block layout for the
VRX200 RCU "wrong" - all "documentation" we have is the old Lantiq UGW
(BSP).
with proper documentation (as in a "public datasheet for the SoC") it
would be easy to spot these mistakes (at least I assume that the
quality of the Infineon / Lantiq datasheets is excellent).

back to reset-intel-syscon:
assigning only one job to the RCU hardware is a good idea (in my opinion).
that brings up a question: why do we need the "syscon" compatible for
the RCU node?
this is typically used when registers are accessed by another IP block
and the other driver has to access these registers as well. does this
mean that there's more hidden in the RCU registers?

OK
you can still use syscon-reboot to set the soft reset bit if Rob
(dt-binding maintainer) doesn't like the "intel,global-reset" property

only now I realized that the reset-intel-syscon driver does not seem
to use the status registers (instead it's looking at the reset
registers when checking the status).
what happened to the status registers - do they still exist in newer
SoCs (like LGM)? why are they not used?

on VRX200 for example there seem to be some cases where the bits in
the reset and status registers are different (for example: the first
GPHY seems to use reset bit 31 but status bit 30)
this is currently not supported in reset-intel-syscon
