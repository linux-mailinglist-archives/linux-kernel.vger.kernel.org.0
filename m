Makes sense.

I am not very well aware about the user interaction with the drivers which
hotplug and manage ZONE_DEVICE memory in general. Hence will not be able to
comment on it's user visible runtime impact. I just figured this out from
code audit while testing ZONE_DEVICE on arm64 platform. But the fix makes
the function bit more expensive as it now involve some additional memory
references.
