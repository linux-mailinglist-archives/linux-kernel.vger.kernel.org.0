AFAICT, the only purpose for a console_lock would be to synchronize
between the console printing kthread and some other component that wants
to write to that same device. So a per-console console_lock should be
the proper solution. However, I will look into the details. My main
concerns about this are the suspend/resume logic and the code sitting
behind /dev/console. I will share details once I've sorted it all out.

Why would it not work so well? Basically the task calling pr_flush()
will monitor the lockless iterators of the various consoles until _all_
have hit/passed the latest sequence number from the time of the call.

You will be running in your own preemptible kthread, so any paths you
take should be safe.

Are you planning on basing the bsod stuff on write_atomic() (which is
used after entering an emergency state) or on the kmsg_dump facility? I
would expect kmsg_dump might be more appropriate, unless there are
concerns that the machine will die before getting that far (i.e. there
is a lot that happens between when an OOPS begins and when kmsg_dumpers
are invoked).
