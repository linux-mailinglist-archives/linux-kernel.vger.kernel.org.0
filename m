*head starts spinning*

I can't see how we can have double put_prev_task() in a row. Let me stare more
at the code.

+1

I think I got it now, it's the double_lock_balance() that can drop the lock.
It even has a comment above it!

Thanks. I had to ask as it was hard to walk all the paths.

Sometimes I get tempted to sprinkle comments or lockdep_assert() but then
I think that can easily get ugly and out of hand. I guess one just has to know
the code.
