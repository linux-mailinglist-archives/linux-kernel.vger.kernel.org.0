Hi,

I already commented on the interface in patch 2/3, so I just have a few
additional comments on the documentation itself.

Maybe move this to the beginning of the section, to make it clear that
you're describing an example API. On first read I found it odd that we're
documenting a userspace library in this document.

I don't think this belongs in the doc, more on a cover letter. Since the
SVA API is now upstream (implementation in progress), you could simply say
something like "the uacce device is built around the IOMMU SVA API".

That might be a bit too detailed, you can just say that the device can
access multiple address spaces, including the one without PASID. All IOMMU
architectures with PASID support this now.

Would it be correct and clearer to say "The fd of the queue is duplicated
on fork, but requests sent from the child process are blocked"?

I don't know if this particular rationale belongs here rather than a cover
letter, but some of this section can be useful to let users decide if they
need uacce or VFIO.

For the record I'm still not entirely convinced that a new solution is
preferable to vfio-mdev.
* Existing userspace drivers such as DPDK may someday benefit from
  adding SVA support to VFIO.
* Patch 2/3 does seem to duplicate a lot of VFIO code for the !SVA mode.
  I'd rather we avoided !SVA support altogether at first, to make the code
  simpler.
* The issue with fork should be fixed in VFIO anyway, if it's an actual
  concern for userspace drivers.

On the other hand, I do agree with the following paragraph that a lighter
solution such as uacce focusing on shared address space and queues could
mean less work for device drivers and libraries.

It would be interesting to write a device driver prototype that implements
both vfio-mdev (with added SVA support) and uacce interfaces and compare
them. But since I'm not the one writing this or the corresponding
userspace libs, I'll stop advocating vfio-mdev next time and focus on the
implementation details :)

Thanks,
Jean
