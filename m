I think we should avoid the use of "bypass" outside of the IOMMU probe()
routine if at all possible, since it leaves the thing wide open if we don't
subsequently probe the master.

Why can't we initialise a page-table early for StreamIDs with these
reserved regions, and then join that up later on if we see a device with
one of those StreamIDs attaching to a DMA domain? I suppose the nasty
case would be attaching to a domain that already has other masters
attached to it. Can we forbid that somehow for these devices? Otherwise,
I think we'd have to transiently switch to bypass whilst switching page
table.

What problems did you run into trying to implement this?
