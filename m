Just what Oleg said. CRIU can restore processes in a new PID namespaces
or in an existing. To restore a process into an existing PID namespace
has the possibility of a PID collision, but if the PID is not yet in use
there is no limitation from CRIU's side.

Restoring into an existing PID namespace which is used by other
processes always has the possibility that between writing to
/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid and clone() something else has fork()'d and
therefore it is racy.
