Hi Paul, I did not fully understand 4. The previous RCU reader section
could not have been IPI'ed or been preempted if interrupts were
disabled across. Also, if softirq/preempt is disabled across the
previous reader section, the previous reader could not be preempted in
these case.

That leaves us with the only scenario where the previous reader was
IPI'ed while softirq/preempt was disabled across it. Is that what you
meant? But in this scenario, the previous reader should have set
exp_hint to false in the previous reader's rcu_read_unlock_special()
invocation itself. So I would think t->rcu_read_unlock_special should
be 0 during the new reader's invocation thus I did not understand how
rcu_read_unlock_special can be called because of a previous reader.

I'll borrow some of that confused color paint if you don't mind ;-)
And we should document this somewhere for future sanity preservation
:-D

thanks,
 - Joel
