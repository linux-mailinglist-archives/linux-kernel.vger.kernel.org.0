Not really. The Soundwire code is dual licensed. Many of the soundwire
symbols are indeed exported as EXPORT_SYMBOL. But I agree this one is
'linux' specific so can be made _GPL.

Pierre, does Intel still care about this being dual licensed or not?

It is used by codec driver which are not upstream yet. So my suggestion
would be NOT to export this and only do so when we have users for it
That would be true for other APIs exported out as well.

The deubugfs code does hold a ref to slave object to read the data and
dump, this particular instance might be able to get rid of (should be
doable)

Yes, but then device exit routine is supposed to do debugfs cleanup as
well, so that would ensure these references are dropped at that point of
time. Greg should that not take care of it or we *should* always do
refcounting.
