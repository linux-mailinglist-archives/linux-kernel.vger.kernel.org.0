So far i have not had any paper with different kind of comparison. But
that is interested for sure, especially to analyze the model for example
based on B-Tree, so when we can fully utilize a cache performance.
Because regular binary trees are just pointer chasing.

As for binder driver and its allocator, is it O(lognN) complexity? Is
there any bottleneck in its implementation?

Thanks!
