It's been a while since this thread started, and I still don't quite get 
the concepts or logic.

First, I don't understand what the problem with "aux" devices is. All 
the SoundWire stuff is based on the concept of DAI, so I guess I am 
missing why introducing the "aux" device changes anything.

Next, a 'stream' connects multiple DAIs to transmit information from 
sources to sinks. A DAI in itself is created without having any notion 
of which stream it will be associated with. This can only be done with 
machine level information.

If you query a DAI to get a stream context, then how is this stream 
context allocated in the first place? It looks like a horse and cart 
problem. Or you are assuming that a specific DAI provides the context, 
and that all other DAIs do not expose this .get_sdw_stream()? What if 
more that 1 DAI provide a stream context?

And last, I am even more lost since w/ the existing codec drivers we 
have, sdw_stream_add_slave() is called from the dai .hw_params callback, 
once you have information on formats/rates, etc. using 
sdw_stream_add_slave() from a machine driver looks like an even bigger 
stretch. I really thought the machine driver would only propagate the 
notion of stream to all DAIs that are part of the same dailink.

I am not trying to block the Qualcomm implementation, just would like to 
make sure the assumptions are clear and that we are not using the same 
API in completely different ways.
