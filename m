I suppose the parent process cleared SSBS explicitly. Isn't the child
after fork() supposed to be nearly identical to the parent? If we did as
you suggest, someone else might complain that SSBS has been set in the
child after fork().

I think the fix is for user space to set SSBS in the child if it no
longer needs it.
