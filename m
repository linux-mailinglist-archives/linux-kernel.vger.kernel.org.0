Wondering if searching and preempting needs will ever be conflicting?
Otherwise sounds like a good direction to me. For the searching aspect, can
we map latency nice values to the % of cores we search in select_idle_cpu?
Thus the search cost can be controlled by latency nice value. But the issue
is if more latency tolerant workloads set to less search, we still need
some mechanism to achieve good spread of threads. Can we keep the sliding
window mechanism in that case? Also will latency nice do anything for
select_idle_core and select_idle_smt?
