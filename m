It wouldn't surprise me if the firmware was doing something funky. It 
was one of the first Thunderbolt equipped models and the support docs 
explicitly say only one Thunderbolt display in Windows and two in later 
versions of OSX. It almost needs a quirk to say "firmware does something 
we don't like, reset the controller and re-discover from scratch".

Anyway, I'm not in any hurry. It doesn't get rebooted often and it's not 
in any way preventing me using the machine. In fact, upgrading the third 
head from an old 24" 1920x1200 to the second Thunderbolt display has 
been invaluable.

> BTW, have you tried to chain the two monitors?

Not yet, but it was something I've been considering. I'll give it a go 
tomorrow. Due to cable length vs display dimensions it'll require me 
cleaning my desk, and that takes some forward planning.
