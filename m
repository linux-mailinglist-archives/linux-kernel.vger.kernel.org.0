Hi Raphael,

Sorry about the long delay.  I have some comments coming shortly.

One general comment: I noticed that several of the (mostly minor)
suggested changes I made for v1 haven't been fixed.

I'll try to suggest them again here for v4, so you don't need to go back
and find them.  But in the future please try to incorporate all the
comments from previous patch sets before posting new versions.  I'm sure
it wasn't intentional, as you did acknowledge and agree to most of the
changes.  But it does waste people's time and goodwill if you neglect to
incorporate their suggestions.  Thanks.
