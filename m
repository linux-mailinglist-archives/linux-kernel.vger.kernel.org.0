I understand that MADV_FREE helps in some situations.  And if the
application want to keep the "contract" after migration, they should
have a way to do that.

Yes.  mmap() can control whether to populate the underlying physical
pages.  But for migrating MADV_FREE pages, there's no control, all pages
will be populated again always by default.  Maybe we should avoid to do
that in some situations too.
