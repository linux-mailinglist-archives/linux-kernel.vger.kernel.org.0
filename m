Are you suggesting that even normal-guest, not use hcall-multi-tce?
or just secure-guest?

It is not sharing some random page. It is sharing a page that is
ear-marked for communicating TCE entries. Yes the address of the page
can be random, depending on where the allocator decides to allocate it.
The purpose of the page is not random.

That page is used for one specific purpose; to communicate the TCE
entries to the hypervisor.

I think, you are making a incorrect connection between this patch and
SWIOTLB.  This patch has nothing to do with SWIOTLB.

No. This patch is NOT for PCI+SWIOTLB.  The SWIOTLB pages are a
different set of pages allocated and earmarked for bounce buffering.

This patch is purely to help the hypervisor setup the TCE table, in the
presence of a IOMMU.

Well, I guess, the cover letter is probably confusing. There are two
patches, which togather enable virtio on secure guests, in the presence
of IOMMU.

The second patch enables virtio in the presence of a IOMMU, to use
DMA_ops+SWIOTLB infrastructure, to correctly navigate the I/O to virtio
devices.

However that by itself wont work if the TCE entires are not correctly
setup in the TCE tables.  The first patch; i.e this patch, helps
accomplish that.

Hope this clears up the confusion.
