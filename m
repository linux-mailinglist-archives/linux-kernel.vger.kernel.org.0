OK, I'm starting to see the bigger picture.

(To provide some rationale for the patch, I think devm is a huge
improvement for probe error-handling, and I did not understand
why every driver must do manual error-handling when dealing with
clocks in probe.)

I did envision kernel modules being loaded on an as-needed basis,
somewhat side-stepping the energy-waste issue you point out.
But I realize that such a use-case may be uncommon. (Especially
due to module auto-loading.)

A few months ago, I was discussing a similar issue with GKH:
Consider a device with a "START" register. Basically, if we write 0,
the device turns itself off; if we write 1, it runs as configured.

I was trying to start the device only when at least one user had
it "open". So I used reference counting, and started the device
on 0->1 open transitions, and stopped the device on 1->0 close
transitions. GKH told me that was the wrong way to do it, and IIRC
suggested to start the device in probe.

I probably misunderstood Greg's suggestion. Where is the right place
to start/stop a device (or gate its clocks)?

Regards.
