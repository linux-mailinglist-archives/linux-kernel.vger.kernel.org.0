Well, we're working on supporting huge puds and pmds in the graphics 
VMAs, although in the write-notify cases we're looking at here, we would 
probably want to split them down to PTE level. But if we would want to 
extend that or if we would want to make this interface general, we'd 
probably want to support also a pud_entry callback.

Looking at zap_pud_range() which when called from unmap_mapping_pages() 
uses identical locking (no mmap_sem), it seems we should be able to get 
away with i_mmap_lock(), making sure the whole page table doesn't 
disappear under us. So it's not clear to me why the mmap_sem is strictly 
needed here. Better to sort those restrictions out now rather than when 
huge entries start appearing.

Sure. Can do that.

Thanks,
