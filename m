Changing its INT interval during runtime seems not so easy, there's no device
drivers doing this to my knowledge. At least xhci needs to restart
endpoint to change
the interval. So I think patching ep descriptor at enumeration stage
is more convincing.

Yes, that's a difficult question here too, when the hub is external device,
it can't be fully controlled by here. Even though it's the same
VID:PID hub chip,
that's not the 100% same device. We don't know how much this will
impact to the other
external hub devices regarding power consumption and compatibility.

Actually the hub is the one to be applied, I don't care much about the
rare case that
a user connects an additional external hub with same PID and connect
external HID
under that hub.

We could reduce autosuspend delay for built-in touchpad when we know
that's better
for power savings only if response time of wake up is good enough. but
we don't know
the optimal values for external HIDs. So we could use the default long
delay for external
devices, or just disable autosuspend for all external HIDs,
so user might experience much less cursor lags even with that rare case.
