So ultimately we see an old northern norwegian idol of =E1=9A=A6yr haunting=
 computing space.
Characters such as Boba Fett, Turrican and Predator, and Metroid are inspir=
ed by it, and probably the 80s show Max Headroom aswell. And many others.

Esoterically it seems to be at the root of norwegian christianity, and inte=
rnational gay christianity, and may be a transvestite, suiting modern ideas=
 of it such as vocal feminization, and breast implants, already then.

Dating back to the mushroom god Tengri 4000BC, which goes even further back=
 into Africa and Tassili, before the typical idea of gods, and fits what ps=
ychiatry calls the model psychosis, and mushroom god belief. And a confused=
 bible.

And that is ofcourse the problem we need to deal with ultimately, and keep =
economic developments, and a worldwide goal of clearing up idolatry in indi=
a, where we clearly see what prophets meant with the vanity of idolatry, an=
d can easily connect to the sense of this.

In a modern day with computers, I/T X keeps all monotheistic developments b=
ack to Adams tablet, dispilio 5200 BC. And from this comes teachings such a=
s "One Dewa without company". In an indian context clearly sensible teachin=
g. And in computing context, fair pay, and a global optimized economy.

And so this should be the goal, and focus development of Source Available s=
pace, which is ofcourse not a new concept such as "GNU", Unix often came wi=
th this.

So then - my research is concluded, and should be easily comprehended by th=
e required people.

Hail The Dewa.
