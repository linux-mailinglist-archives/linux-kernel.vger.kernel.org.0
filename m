When we enter into fadump crash path via system reset we fail to update
the pstore.

On the system reset path we first update the pstore then we go for fadump
crash. But the problem here is when all the CPUs try to get the pstore
lock to initiate the pstore write, only one CPUs will acquire the lock
and proceed with the pstore write. Meanwhile, other CPUs who did not get
the lock, do not wait for their turn to write to the pstore and simply
proceed with the next operation which is fadump crash. One of the CPU who
proceeded with fadump crash path, triggers the crash and do not wait for
the CPU who gets the pstore lock to complete the pstore update.

Timeline diagram to depicts the sequence of events that leads to an
unsuccessful pstore update when we hit fadump crash path via system reset.

            Race: crash triggered before pstore
                  update completes

In order to avoid the race between the CPU who proceeds with the pstore
and the CPU who triggers the crash, a delay of 100 milliseconds is added
on fadump crash path to allow pstore update to complete before we trigger
the crash.
