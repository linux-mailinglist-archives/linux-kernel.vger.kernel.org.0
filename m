You are right, it is not different.

As for lru_add_drain_all(), I wonder at what point that
should happen?

It appears that the order in which things are done does
not really provide a good moment:
1) decide to attempt allocating a range of memory
2) scan each page block for unmovable pages
3) if no unmovable pages are found, mark the page block
   MIGRATE_ISOLATE

I wonder if we should do things the opposite way, first
marking the page block MIGRATE_ISOLATE (to prevent new
allocations), then scanning it, and calling lru_add_drain_all
if we encounter a page that looks like it could benefit from
that.

If we still see unmovable pages after that, it is cheap
enough to set the page block back to its previous state.

I have merged your suggestions into my code base. Thank
you for pointing out that 4kB pages have the exact same
restrictions as THPs, and why.

I'll run some tests and will post v2 of the series soon.
