I would agree with the move, but the files are not in
drivers/tty/serial/ for the drivers you are asking to configure in that
directory.

So unless we want to move these drivers (and it's not really worth it,
unless we want to create drivers/tty/serial/obsolete/ or something like
that), I would just leave this alone.
