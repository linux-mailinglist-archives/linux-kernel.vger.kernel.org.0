Duplicate code (logic) or just characters ?

IMHO, readability is an important aspect, so we could be careful about
that. Some of your other patches IMHO made it actually a bit easier
to read, but this particular case doesnt seem so to (just according
to my personal taste).

I believe the compiler can do optimize that, based on the given flags.
(eg. size vs. speed). Therefore, I think that readability for the
human reader should be primary argument.

Which criterias are you operating on ?

I think it's good that you're using tools like cocci for pointing out
*possible* points of useful refactoring. But that doesn't mean that a
particular patch can be accepted or not in the greater context.

Note that such issues are pretty subjective - it's not a technical but
an asthetic matter, so such issues can't be resolved by logic. Here, the
better something fits the personal taste of the maintainrs, the easier
it is for them to quickly understand the code (w/o having to give it any
deeper thoughts), thus reduces their brain load. Therefore that should
be the the primary argument left.

Don't see this as a judgment of your work as such - this kind of work
just tends to have a high rate of non-acceptable output (unless the
individual maintainer doing it himself).
