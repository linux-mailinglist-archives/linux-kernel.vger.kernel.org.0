I've been using schedviz - but have had to 'fixup' wrapped traces so that
all the cpu traces start at the same time to get it to load them.
I managed to find what the worker thread was running - but only
because it ran for the entire time 'echo t >/proc/sysrq-trigger' took
to finish. Then I looked at the sources to find the code...

I'm surprised the 'normal case' for tracing function entry isn't done
in assembler without saving all the registers (etc).
For tsc stamps I think it should be possible saving just 3 registers
in under 32 instructions. Scaling to ns is a bit harder.
It's a shame the ns scaling isn't left to the reading code.
