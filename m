Thanks Vlastimil, here is why I took the approach I did.

I instrumented some of the long stalls.  Here is one common example:
should_compact_retry returned true 5000000 consecutive times.  However,
the variable compaction_retries is zero.  We never get to the code that
increments the compaction_retries count because compaction_made_progress
is false and compaction_withdrawn is true.  As suggested earlier, I noted
why compaction_withdrawn is true.  Of the 5000000 calls,
4921875 were COMPACT_DEFERRED
78125 were COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED
Note that 5000000/64(1 << COMPACT_MAX_DEFER_SHIFT) == 78125

I then started looking into why COMPACT_DEFERRED and COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED
were being set/returned so often.
COMPACT_DEFERRED is set/returned in try_to_compact_pages.  Specifically,
		if (prio > MIN_COMPACT_PRIORITY
					&& compaction_deferred(zone, order)) {
			rc = max_t(enum compact_result, COMPACT_DEFERRED, rc);
			continue;
		}
COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED is set/returned in __compact_finished. Specifically,
	if (compact_scanners_met(cc)) {
		/* Let the next compaction start anew. */
		reset_cached_positions(cc->zone);

		/* ... */

		if (cc->direct_compaction)
			cc->zone->compact_blockskip_flush = true;

		if (cc->whole_zone)
			return COMPACT_COMPLETE;
		else
			return COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED;
	}

In both cases, compact_priority being MIN_COMPACT_COSTLY_PRIORITY and not
being able to go to MIN_COMPACT_PRIORITY caused the 'compaction_withdrawn'
result to be set/returned.

I do not know the subtleties of the compaction code, but it seems like
retrying in this manner does not make sense.

The example above, resulted in a stall of a little over 5 minutes.  However,
I have seen them last for hours.  Sure, the caller (admin for hugetlbfs)
knows there may be high costs.  But, I think minutes/hours to try and allocate
a single huge page is too much.  We should fail sooner that that.

I'll put something like this together to test.
