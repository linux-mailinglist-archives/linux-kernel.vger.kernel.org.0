I'm not speaking of blkfront/blkback only, but of net, tpm, scsi, pvcall
etc. frontends/backends. After all you are modifying a function common
to all PV driver pairs.

You are removing a state switc to "closed" in case the state was _not_
"closing" before. So any PV driver reacting to "closed" of the other end
in case the previous state might not have been "closing" before is at
risk to misbehave with your patch.
