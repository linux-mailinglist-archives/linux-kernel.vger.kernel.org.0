This needs supporting data. find_idlest_group_cpu is generally from
a fork() context where it's not particularly performance critical.
select_idle_sibling and the helpers it uses is wakeup context where is
is often much more critical to wake quickly than find the best CPU. The
biggest challenge of select_idle_sibling is making a "good enough decision"
quickly without disrupting cache but a fork-intensive workload making quick
decision can overload local domains requiring fixing by the load balancer.

As the patch stands, I think a fork-intensive workload where each
process is doing small amounts of work will suffer from overloading
domains and have variable performance depending on how quickly the load
balancer reacts.
