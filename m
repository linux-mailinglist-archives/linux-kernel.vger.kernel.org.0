Really? I'm surprised to know that... Sorry I didn't see such GICv2 
platforms in my work, so I made the wrong assumption.
I don't expect much performance improvement for GICv3 platforms. The 
precondition for this patch is that few platforms running KVM are using 
GICv2. If it is not right, please just ignore it.

Thanks,
