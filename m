Agreed, I will reword the description.

Sure. I started with the helpers in the hope that, I would need fewer
changes to individual subsystems, once I convert them to use the
new helpers.

i.e, driver A -> use new helper and the change the new helper.

rather than

change all callers of *_find_device() and then all to switch to new helper.

Anyways, looks like the latter is better in terms of splitting the series.
I will rework the series.

Thanks a lot for your input
