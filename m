That was an irc discussion, and I've changed my mind on that.

My big issue ended up being that autorefresh was enabled (which
basically turns the command panel into a pseudo video mode panel),
which appears incompatible with using the start kick.  If FW is
configuring things in autorefresh mode, the driver likely doesn't
know, and will make a mess of things by using the start kick.

Disabling autorefresh would make the driver work as is, but fbcon
wouldn't work well (you'd need to do a start kick per frame, which
doesn't seem to happen).  Removing the start kick and using the
autorefresh feature seemed better in my testing, but I haven't cleaned
up my code tree to send something up.

However, lets see how the hardware is actually configured in Brian's case.
