Not only commit 526f5b851a96 )("tipc: fix modprobe tipc failed after
switch order of device registration") has to be reverted, but also I
found commit 7e27e8d6130c ("tipc: switch order of device registration to
fix a crash") introduced a serious regression which makes tipc internal
topology service server failed to be created.

Today I will fix it with the following approaches:
1. Revert commit 7e27e8d6130c ("tipc: switch order of device
registration to fix a crash")
2. Use another method to solve the problem that commit 7e27e8d6130c
tries to fix.

Thanks,
Ying
