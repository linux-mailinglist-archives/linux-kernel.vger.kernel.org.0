"Your honor, I have no further questions at this time, but I reserve
the right to recall this witness."

Outside of things like MMIO (where one could argue that the corresponding
READ_ONCE() is in the device firmware), the use cases I can imagine
for WRITE_ONCE() with no READ_ONCE() are quite strange.  For example,
doing the WRITE_ONCE()s while read-holding a given lock and doing plain
reads while write-holding that same lock.  While at the same time being
worried about store tearing and similar.

Perhaps I am suffering a failure of imagination, but I am not seeing
a reasonable use for such things at the moment.

Agreed, especially given that only one bit of ->flag is most likely
ever changing.

Agreed, and I expect READ_ONCE() to continue to be used more heavily than
is WRITE_ONCE(), even including the documentation-only WRITE_ONCE() usage.
