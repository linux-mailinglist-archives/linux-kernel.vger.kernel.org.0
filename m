Also use the following trace script this time:

#!/bin/sh

MAJ=3D$1
MIN=3D$2
MAJ=3D$(( $MAJ << 20 ))
DEV=3D$(( $MAJ | $MIN ))

/usr/share/bcc/tools/trace -t -C \
    't:block:block_rq_issue (args->dev =3D=3D '$DEV') "%s %d %d", args->rwb=
s, args->sector, args->nr_sector' \
    't:block:block_rq_insert (args->dev =3D=3D '$DEV') "%s %d %d", args->rw=
bs, args->sector, args->nr_sector'


Thanks,
