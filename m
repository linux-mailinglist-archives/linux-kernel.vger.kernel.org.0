While in the process of preparing vchiq to support the Raspberry Pi 4, I
stumbled upon a bunch of dead code in it. Which this series deletes.

Ultimately the idea is to clean up vchiq_bcm2835_arm.c up to a point
where it'll be easy to join it with vchiq_arm.c, which IIRC the TODO
file states, should be the sole responsible for platform code.

With this we'll be able to introduce RPi4's functionality in a cleaner
way.

Overall it's a 500 line clean up, I tried to keep the patches as small and
manageable as possible, but I'd be happy to squash them if you prefer it
that way.

This was tested on a RPi3-B using the camera and HDMI audio and
vchiq_test app.

Changes since v1:
 - Reordered patches so as to have all of the suspend/resume state
   deletion together
 - Fix bug found by kbuild test robot
 - move "staging: vc04_services: Get rid of vc_suspend_state in struct
   vchiq_arm_state" into "staging: vc04_services: Get rid of unused
   suspend/resume states"
