Ah yes, I failed to mentally preprocess the debug config :)

I'm not sure it was a criticism so much as an observation of an aspect 
that deserved consideration (certainly it was on my part, and I read 
Dmitry's "It might still, ..." as implying the same). I'd say by this 
point it has been thoroughly considered, and personally I'm now happy 
with the conclusion that the kind of embedded platforms that will have 
many dozens of clocks are also the kind that will tend to have enough 
padding to make it moot, and thus the code simplification probably is 
worthwhile overall.
