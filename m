 rcu-fence into explanation.txt

This patch updates the Linux Kernel Memory Model's explanation.txt
file to incorporate the introduction of the rcu-order relation and
the redefinition of rcu-fence made by commit 15aa25cbf0cc
("tools/memory-model: Change definition of rcu-fence").

+The rcu-fence relation is a simple extension of rcu-order.  While
+rcu-order only links certain fence events (calls to synchronize_rcu(),
+rcu_read_lock(), or rcu_read_unlock()), rcu-fence links any events
+that are separated by an rcu-order link.  This is analogous to the way
+the strong-fence relation links events that are separated by an
+smp_mb() fence event (as mentioned above, rcu-order links act kind of

+there are fence events E and F such that:

+From the discussion above, we see this implies not only that X
+executes before Y, but also (if X is a store) that X propagates to

+"super-strong" fence: Unlike the original strong fences (smp_mb() and

+CPUs.  (Perhaps this fact should lead us to say that rcu-fence isn't
