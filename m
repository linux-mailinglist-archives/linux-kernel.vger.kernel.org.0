Maybe there's a misunderstanding: when you send a patchset which is not
marked RFC, I read this, as, this patchset is ready for application. But
then the 0day bot catches build errors which means, not ready yet.

And I believe you expected for the 0day bot to test the patches first
and they should then to be considered for application. Yes, no?

That's why I suggested you to do randconfig builds yourself and not
depend on the 0day bot as it is known to be unreliable.

So I didn't do anything to make you feel negative - definitely not
intentionally.

I believe I already explained what my problem with that is. If you don't
see it, then let's agree to disagree.

Yes, let's do that.
