Yeah, what's there at the cover letter doesn't apply to this specific
patch. The thing is that I wrote this series a lot of time ago (2016/17).

I revived those per a request at KS ML, as we still need to expose the
ABI content on some book that will be used by userspace people.

So, I just rebased it on the top of curent Kernel, add a cover letter
with the things I remembered and re-sent.

In the specific case of this patch, the ":" there actually makes sense
for someone that it is reading it as a text file, and it is an easy
hack to make it parse better.

Yeah, either that or provide an alternative to "Description" tag, to be
used with more complex ABI descriptions.

One of the things that occurred to me, back on 2017, is that we should
have a way to to specify that an specific ABI description would have
a rich format. Something like:

What:		/sys/bus/usb/devices/<busnum>-<devnum>:<config num>.<interface num>/<hid-bus>:<vendor-id>:<product-id>.<num>/pyra/roccatpyra<minor>/actual_cpi
Date:		August 2010
Contact:	Stefan Achatz <erazor_de@users.sourceforge.net>
RST-Description:
		It is possible to switch the cpi setting of the mouse with the
		press of a button.
		When read, this file returns the raw number of the actual cpi
		setting reported by the mouse. This number has to be further
		processed to receive the real dpi value:

		===== =====
		VALUE DPI
		===== =====
		1     400
		2     800
		4     1600
		===== =====

With that, the script will know that the description contents will be using
the ReST markup, and parse it accordingly. Right now, what it does, instead,
is to place the description on a code-block, e. g. it will produce this
output for the description:

::

		It is possible to switch the cpi setting of the mouse with the
		press of a button.
		When read, this file returns the raw number of the actual cpi
		setting reported by the mouse. This number has to be further

Greg, 

what do you think?

Thanks,
Mauro
