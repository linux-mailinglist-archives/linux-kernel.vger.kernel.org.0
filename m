Yes, it is clear to me, I absolutely agree that is not friendly :)

Previously without KASLR, one can check /proc/iomem to find a possible
free area and use it for next and future boot.  But in case KASLR
enabled nowadays it become harder to predict the persistent free areas.

We would suggest people to use crashkernel=X instead.  for the X@Y
I believe it is some historic thing, it *should* be able to be obsolete
at least on X86, (not sure other arches).
I expect people can comment if they have some use cases requiring this
X@Y way. 

We have modified the crashkernel=X to search 0 - 4G memory instead
of old 0 - 896M for low memory areas, so a possible case is people who
uses very old kexec-tools which can only load kernel to memory under
896M.

Another way is we just obsolete X@Y, but introduce another interface
like crahskernel=X,max=  (max will be used like the CRASH_ADDR_HIGH_MAX
in arch/x86/kernel/setup.c)

Maybe X@Y,max=..  Then kernel will search begin with Y, and stop until
max - 1;
