That's what I suggested at first. But then I saw at least one other place where 
this pattern is being used, and it shook my confidence. I don't clearly see what
the PageReserved check is protecting against here, but it's better to be
safe, and do things in two steps: step 1 is *only* convert from put_page()
to put_user_page(), and step 2 is to maybe remove the PageReserved() check,
once fully understood.
