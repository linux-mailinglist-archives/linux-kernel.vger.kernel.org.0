I have been running this for linux-next daily.

https://github.com/cailca/linux-mm

"test.sh" will give you some ideas. All the .config has almost all the MM
debugging options turned on, but it might need some modifications to run on QEMU
 etc.

"compile.sh" will have some additional MM debugging command-line options, and
some keywords to catch compilation warnings for MM.
