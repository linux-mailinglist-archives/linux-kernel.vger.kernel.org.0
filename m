Okay because kernel stack might be on vmalloc() space.

Because this test will be executed early during boot, alloc_contig_range()
makes sense for this purpose. Something like alloc_gigantic_page() which other
than getting the order from huge_page_order(h) is sort of a generic allocator.
Shall we make core part of the function a generic allocator for broader usage
in kernel in case the page allocator would not be sufficient like in this case
which requires a PUD size and a PUD aligned memory.

In case PUD aligned memory block cannot be allocated, pud_basic_tests() must
be skipped and a PMD aligned memory block should be used instead as fallback
for other tests.

The current proposal restricts itself to very basic operations at each page
table level for now. I have subsequent patches which adds various MM feature
related specific helpers with respect to SPECIAL, DEVMAP, HugeTLB entries
etc. We can also explore platform specific helpers for ioremap and vmalloc.
But that is for subsequent patches and scope for current proposal is limited.

THP (or PUD THP) config wrappers are here because these helpers mentioned in
the current proposal are present only when THP (or PUD THP) is enabled but
are absent otherwise. Without these wrappers, we will have build failures.
Hence these wrappers are necessary.
