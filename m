Not that I want to defend that code, but the mm patch that conflicts
already shows that removing the token is fine as nobody needs or
requires it. So the fixup patch in my tree was just a bridge to that patch,
which reduces conflicts. Rip the token out of the new API, pass it as NULL
to the old API until the mm patch is merged against it which drops the
token from the old API.
