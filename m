I am working on new version of patches but I have some concerns. Please
look below for more details...

Will do...

Is not possible to "identify which chunks of memory are occupied by
kernel data" today? I think that it is. So, this does not look like
a valid point for change. Am I missing something?

Yeah...

OK.

High mark seems better for me here.

Yep.

Anyway, I agree with the idea but I am not sure it makes sense to
introduce something which does not have users right now. Does it?

My first proposal have both fields...

I am not sure that I understand the idea of the main (root) structure.
Should it point to itself?

Sounds nice but I think that it is an overkill in many simple cases,
e.g. look at MLE entry point. In case of MLE entry point we do not need
nothing fancy. So, I think that this filed should be a member of the
kernel_info which points directly to new MLE entry point. I can agree
that we can use the mechanism mentioned by you above in more complicated
cases and it can be described in Documentation/x86/boot.rst. But I would
not enforce it for everything. Just for the sake of simplicity.

OK.

Make sense for me.

So, it seems to me that we have to have at least two patches:
  - one introducing the kernel_info structure,
  - another introducing the setup_indirect and bumping the
    boot protocol version number.

This thing has at least one cons: first patch introduces a new boot
protocol feature but it is not reflected in the protocol version change.
Not perfect but I do not think that we should bump the version number in
first patch. do you have better idea?
