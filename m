This is what I added, so I would drop this one.

Thanks for your explanation. I would keep this in mind.

Now I have one more question, hope it won't sound silly. (16KB / 256) = 64,
this means if each function call takes 256 space on stack, the max call depth
is 64. So how deep a kernel function call would be? or expected to be?

Also because of the limit space on stack, recursive function is not welcome in
kernel neither. Am I right?
