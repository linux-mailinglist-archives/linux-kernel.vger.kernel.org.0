Define "most". All the arm64 systems I have around (and trust me, that's
quite a number of them) can either use u-boot, which has more than
enough EFI support to use this functionality, or use EDK-II natively.

You're are missing the point. kexec with EFI has 0 overhead (no
non-kernel EFI code gets executed), doesn't impact your time budget, and
only relies on a single in-memory table. This can be pretty trivially
provided by the dumbest EFI shim.

All you are describing above is a set of self imposed limitations in
your bootloader, which you are fully in control of. So instead of
reinventing a square wheel, I suggest you adopt the existing implementation.

Another reason not to do this is interoperability: I want to be able to
kexec whatever Linux kernel I want, without having to cope with all
flavours of the same functionality. Effectively, the EFI table is a
private ABI between two Linux kernels. We're not changing it.
