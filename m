static const struct file_operations ima_measure_policy_ops = {
	.release = ima_release_policy,
};

ima_update_policy() is called from ima_release_policy() function.

On my test machine I have the IMA policy in /etc/ima/ima-policy file. 
When IMA policy is setup from this file, I see ima_release_policy() 
called (which in turn calls ima_update_policy()).

How can I have ima_update_policy() called before a custom policy is loaded?

If CONFIG_IMA_WRITE_POLICY is enabled, IMA policy can be updated at 
runtime - which would invoke ima_update_policy().

Is there any other way ima_update_policy() can get called?

When ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement() is called the first time, 
the flag ima_process_keys_for_measurement is set to true and all queued 
keys are processed at that time.

The queue is not used after this point - In the IMA hook the key is 
processed immediately when ima_process_keys_for_measurement is set to true.

ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement() can be called multiple times, 
but on 2nd and subsequent calls it will be a NOP.

Please let me know how using RCU method would help.
