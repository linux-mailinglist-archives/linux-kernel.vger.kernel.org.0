I am not totally sold on the idea to do so as much work as possible in
the IRQ context. I started to play with the patches from Keith [1] which
move the work to proper kernel thread.

As it turnes out, we missed one fix 2887e41b910b ("blk-wbt: Avoid lock
contention and thundering herd issue in wbt_wait") in our enterprise
kernel which helps but doesn't solve the real cause. But as I said
moving the work out of the IRQ context will address all those
problems. Obvious there is no free lunch, let's see if we find a way
to address all the performance issues.

Thanks,
Daniel
