I don't think that this makes sense; further I think that this
highlights that the current driver doesn't support such a configuration
for other reasons.

A DSU instance can only be accessed from a CPU associated with it, since
it's accessed via sysregs. The IRQ handler must run on one of those
CPUs.

To handle that, the DSU PMU driver will need to gain an understanding of
which CPUs are associated with the instance. As it stands the driver
seems to assume that there's a single DSU instance, and that all CPUs
are affine to that same instance.

So NAK to this patch, given the above.

Thanks,
Mark.
