Great, get the akcipher code merged then, that should solve your
problem.

No, do not try to route-around the proper api being present and hack up
something on your own, that way lies madness and you will then have to
support two apis for the hardware if your char driver is accepted.

Just work on the akcipher code to get that cleaned up properly and
merged, along with your driver that uses it, and all should be fine.

good luck!
