> Wow, __fpu__restore_sig is a mess. We have __copy_from... that is Obviously Incorrect (tm) even though it’s not obviously exploitable. (It’s wrong because the *wrong pointer* is checked with access_ok().). We have a fast path that will execute just enough of the time to make debugging the slow path really annoying. (We should probably delete the fast path.)  There are pagefault_disable() call in there mostly to confuse people. (So we take a fault and sleep — big deal.  We have temporarily corrupt state, but no one will ever read it.  The retry after sleeping will clobber xstate, but lazy save is long gone and this should be fine now.  The real issue is that, if we’re preempted after a successful a successful restore, then the new state will get lost.)

It causes corruption in other tasks, e.g. a non-CET task gets a control-protection fault.
