Subject: [PATCH 1/3 v2] char: group dev configs togther
Date:   Wed, 11 Mar 2020 15:57:34 -0700

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Group /dev/{mem,kmem,nvram,raw,port} driver configs together.
This also means that tty configs are now grouped together instead
of being split up.

This just moves Kconfig lines around. There are no other changes.
