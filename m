Er...I don't think so. Tim's patch is meant to solve fairness issue as
mine, it doesn't attempt to address the forced idle issue.

I actually think this is expected behaviour.

Without core scheduling, when deciding which task to run, we will first
decide which "se" to run from the CPU's root level cfs runqueue and then
go downwards. Let's call the chosen se on the root level cfs runqueue
the winner se. Then with core scheduling, we will also need compare the
two winner "se"s of each hyperthread and choose the core wide winner "se".

core wide vruntime makes sense when there are multiple tasks of
different cgroups queued on the same core. e.g. when there are two
tasks of cgroupA and one task of cgroupB are queued on the same core,
assume cgroupA's one task is on one hyperthread and its other task is on
the other hyperthread with cgroupB's task. With my current
implementation or Tim's, cgroupA will get more time than cgroupB. If we
maintain core wide vruntime for cgroupA and cgroupB, we should be able
to maintain fairness between cgroups on this core. Tim propose to solve
this problem by doing some kind of load balancing if I'm not mistaken, I
haven't taken a look at this yet.
