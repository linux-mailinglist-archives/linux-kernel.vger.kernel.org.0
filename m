I am completely new to GCC plugins but I had a look and I think I found 
a possible solution to retrieve at least part of this information using 
the RTL representation in GCC. I can't say it will work for sure but I 
would be happy to discuss it with you if you want.
Although there are still some area I need to investigate related to 
interacting with the RTL representation and storing info into the ELF
I'd be interested in giving it a try, if you are okay with that.

Thanks,
