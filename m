okay, more changelog as

1. Patched the Kdoc for both lock_area/unlock_area and _suspend/_resume
2. Created a helper to read default protected value (after device power 
on)
        for protection function detection.
3. patched the prefix for Macronix deep power down command, 0xB9
4. Patched the description of mxic_nand_resume() and add a small sleeping 
delay.
5. Created a helper for deep power down device part number detection.
