I'm tempted to say the other way around.

Consider the case where you claim fixed2 with a pinned event and then
have another fixed2 in the flexible list. At that point you're _never_
going to run any other flexible events (without Song's patch).

This patch isn't going to help with that. Similarly, Songs patch helps
with your situation where it will allow rotation to resume after you
disable/remove all active events (while you still have pending events).

This; so Song's patch fixes the fundamental problem of the rotation not
working right under certain conditions.

This I disagree with -- you don't get a guarantee other than
timer_period/n when you multiplex, and idling the counters until the
next tick doesn't violate that at all.

Disagreed, Song's patch removed the fundamental blind spot of rotation
completely failing.

This just slightly optimizes counter usage -- at a cost of having to
reprogram the counters more often.

Not saying we shouldn't do this, but this justification is just all
sorts of wrong.
