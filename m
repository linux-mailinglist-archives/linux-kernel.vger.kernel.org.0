Your spelling of "EFI" is like a random number generator in this
paragraph: "Efi", "efi" and "EFI". Can you please be more careful when
writing your commit messages? They're not some random text you hurriedly
jot down before sending the patch but a most important description of
why a change is being done.

And if you don't see their importance now, just try doing some git
archeology, trying to understand why a change has been done in the past
and then encounter a commit message two-liner which doesn't say sh*t.
Then you'll start appreciating properly written commit messages.

Why don't you simply explain what
choose_random_location()->find_random_virt_addr() does? That's the
problem you're solving, right? KASLR using LOAD_PHYSICAL_ADDR as the
minimum...

... or do you mean by that the dance in
arch/x86/boot/compressed/head_64.S where we move the kernel temporarily
to LOAD_PHYSICAL_ADDR for the decompression?

You can simply say that here...
