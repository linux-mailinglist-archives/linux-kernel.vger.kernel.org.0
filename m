It is very rare for such machine without any low memory in X86, at least
from what I know,  so the current way just works fine.

Since arm64 is quite different, I would agree with current way
proposed in the patch, but a question is, for those arm64 systems how can
admin know if low crashkernel memory is needed or not?  and just skip the
low reservation for machine with high memory installed only?

Agreed,  it is still a potential problem though.  Say we have both low
and high reserved.  Kdump kernel boots up, the kernel and drivers,
applications will use memory, I'm not sure if there is a memory
allocation policy to let them all use high mem first..  Anyway that is
beyond the kexec-tools and resource name.
