Then if your question is what to do with these "Reviewed-by", you should
edit your patches and place these fields next to your Signed-off-by line
to indicate that these persons have reviewed this code (and didn't have
anything particular to say about it). From this point you should not
modify the patches with this tag.

When you'll resend your final series to the maintainer, it will include
all these reviewed-by tags and will generally save the maintainer some
review time by skipping some of them.
