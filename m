On which SoC? Your commit message talks about heterogeneous systems (wrt
SSBS) as though they don't apply in your case. Could you provide us with
a reproducer?

I guess it could happen during sigreturn if the signal handler wasn't
careful about preserving bits in pstate, although it doesn't feel like
something you'd regularly run into.

But hang on a sec -- it looks like the context switch logic in
cbdf8a189a66 actually does the wrong thing for systems where all of the
CPUs implement SSBS. I don't think it explains the behaviour you're seeing,
but I do think it could end up in situations where SSBS is unexpectedly
*set*.
