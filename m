Subject: [PATCH v4 27/28] docs: scheduler: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst
Date:   Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:53:03 -0300
Message-Id: <ce9ca0101ef402821bb7b69e500b8662b87ca725.1560361364.git.mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In order to prepare to add them to the Kernel API book,
convert the files to ReST format.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
