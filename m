It would be better if we could stick to the same approach used by other 
Linux architectures.  That keeps things consistent across architectures.  
However, in the short term, as you note, the header file changes to get to 
that point are likely to be too intense for the late -rc series that we're 
in.

So, queued for v5.3-rc7.  Thanks very much for the speedy fix,
