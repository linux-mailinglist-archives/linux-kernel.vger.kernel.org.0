I'm not going to feel bad for trying to improve a piece of code and not
getting it right the first time.
Removal of a custom struct that is only used to copy bits of information
into another struct for which we have a dedicated in-kernel struct to
avoid exactly that seems like a valid use of
s/<custom-struct>/<dedicated-kernel-struct>/ to me; especially since I
needed to touch that file anyway.

If you're concerned about siginfo_t being used in more places than it is
right now, then please put a comment above it that it should be avoided
and that because of architectural nuances clear_signfo() needs to be
used to initialize it correctly.
