FWIW Clang has __attribute((uninitialized)) already:
https://reviews.llvm.org/rL349442
I agree that making it in GCC is easier if initialization itself is
implemented as part of GCC.

There've been concerns about such flags easily going out of control
(my original proposal for heap initialization contained such a flag).
To some extent their spread can be prevented by build-time checks, but
a simple grep can be insufficient, as people will start creating
helper functions to allocate with __GFP_UNINITIALIZED.

This sure makes sense. If this policy is adopted kernel-wide, we won't
need any debugging tools for uninit variables, so it's natural to
initialize them to zero.
