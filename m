There's no desire to call memblock_reserve() twice. It's just that leaving
the call for it in kaslr rather than in setup_arch() may end up with
unreserved FDT because kaslr was disabled or even compiled out.

I've suggested to use fixmap_remap_fdt() everywhere because IMHO this
improves readability and allows to un-export __fixmap_remap_fdt().
