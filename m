Adding a few people who may be interested in this discussion.

Peter suggested to try WRITE_ONCE for the two zero writes to see if that
"fixes" it.

However, according to Peter and Paul, but not Mary, Linus has argued
that normal aligned word stores shouldn't tear.  If that's our story
then it sounds like it's a compiler issue and WRITE_ONCE shouldn't
really be needed here to prevent the memset() call.
