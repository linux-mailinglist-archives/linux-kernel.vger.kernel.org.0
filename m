While I agree your general observation about GFP_NOFAIL, I am afraid the
discussion here is about "struct kmemleak_object" slab cache from a single call
site create_object().

Again, it seems you are talking about GFP_NOFAIL in general. I don't really see
much unpredictable MM behavior which would disrupt the testing or generate
false-positive bug reports when "struct kmemleak_object" allocations with
GFP_NOFAIL apart from some warnings. All I see is that kmemleak stay alive help
find real memory leaks.
