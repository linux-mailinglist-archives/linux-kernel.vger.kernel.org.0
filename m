Yes, but as per specification, the idea is to release the channel for
other communication.

Yes indeed, it's intentional and async is applicable for channel usage.

This is how notifications are designed and must work. I would suggest
to use notifications instead. Do you see any issues with that approach ?

Ah you do mention about overlap. I am replying as I read, sorry for that.
Anyways, let me know if we can just use notifications. Also the current
sync users(mainly clocks and sensors), may need even change in Linux
infrastructure if we need to make it work in notification style.

It would be good to know the use case you are referring.

Yes, I did think about this but I left it as is thinking it may not be
important. Do you think that makes a difference ? I am fine to change
if there are users that needs to handle the difference.
