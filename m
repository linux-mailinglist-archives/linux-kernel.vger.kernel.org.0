That should result in the same behavior if I'm not wrong.

a) Checking the head, skipping over the tail
b) Checking for every tail the head

However, if the compound page spans multiple pageblocks, I am not sure 
if your change is correct. (if you don't start at the compoound head - 
when page != compoound_head(page), you would still jump 1 << 
compound_order(page))
