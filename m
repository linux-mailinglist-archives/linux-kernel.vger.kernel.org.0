I have the opportunity of transferring the left over fund $5.4 Million
us dollars of one of my Bank clients who died in the collapsing of the
world trade center on september 11th 2001.I have placed this fund to
and escrow account without name of beneficiary.i will use my position
here in the bank to effect a hitch free transfer of the fund to your
bank account and there will be no trace.

I agree that 40% of this money will be for you as my foreign
partner,50% for me while 10% will be for the expenses that will occur
in this transaction .If you are really interested in my proposal
