Driver core patches for 5.4-rc1

Here is the big driver core update for 5.4-rc1.

There was a bit of a churn in here, with a number of core and OF
platform patches being added to the tree, and then after much discussion
and review and a day-long in-person meeting, they were decided to be
reverted and a new set of patches is currently being reviewed on the
mailing list.

Other than that churn, there are two "persistent" branches in here that
other trees will be pulling in as well during the merge window.  One
branch to add support for drivers to have the driver core automatically
add sysfs attribute files when a driver is bound to a device so that the
driver doesn't have to manually do it (and then clean it up, as it
always gets it wrong).

There's another branch in here for generic lookup helpers for the driver
core that lots of busses are starting to use.  That's the majority of
the non-driver-core changes in this patch series.

There's also some on-going debugfs file creation cleanup that has been
slowly happening over the past few releases, with the goal to hopefully
get that done sometime next year.

All of these have been in linux-next for a while now with no reported
issues.
