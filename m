Then you have a whole bunch of questions to answer.  For example:

What happens if you mprotect() or similar when the mapping is already
in use in a way that's incompatible with MAP_EXCLUSIVE?

Is it actually reasonable to malloc() some memory and then make it exclusiv=
e?

Are you permitted to map a file MAP_EXCLUSIVE?  What does it mean?

What does MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_EXCLUSIVE do?

How does one pass exclusive memory via SCM_RIGHTS?  (If it's a
memfd-like or chardev interface, it's trivial.  mmap(), not so much.)

And finally, there's my personal giant pet peeve: a major use of this
will be for virtualization.  I suspect that a lot of people would like
the majority of KVM guest memory to be unmapped from the host
pagetables.  But people might also like for guest memory to be
unmapped in *QEMU's* pagetables, and mmap() is a basically worthless
interface for this.  Getting fd-backed memory into a guest will take
some possibly major work in the kernel, but getting vma-backed memory
into a guest without mapping it in the host user address space seems
much, much worse.

Will people really want to do malloc() and then remap it exclusive?
This sounds dubiously useful at best.
