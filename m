Scratch that, I can't read. The registration is done in early initcalls (and
we have the unpark in the secondary bringup anyway), so when we spool up the
secondaries we'll get wakeups for the smpboot threads. AFAIR only softirqd
and cpuhp are CFS, but while this satisfied some of my curiosity this doesn't
seem super helpful on its own.
