----------------------------------------------------------------
regulator: Updates for v5.2

In terms of big picture changes this has been an extremely quiet release
however there's a lot of changes and a fairly big diffstat thanks to a
bunch of small fixes, mainly coming from Axel Lin.  Thanks to his work
this release removes code overall even though we've added a new (albiet
fairly small) driver.

Notable things:

 - A fix for a long standing issue with locking on error interrupts from
   Steve Twiss.
 - A new driver for ST Microelectonics STM32 PWR.
