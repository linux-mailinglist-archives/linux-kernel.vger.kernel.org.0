As you say, ifdefs are ugly. I try to stay away from them as much as
possible (as you may have noticed with the NOHZ stuff). They just make
code harder to read (I know someone who'd say "it's free code obfuscation"),
and that is especially true in the patch you reference where it conditions
variable declaration.

So it may not have been the "proper" fix after all...

To be super nitpicky, I'd argue the __maybe_unused attribute should be
placed before the variable name - the kernel/sched/* code goes with
prefixing rather than postfixing (there is *one* exception in deadline.c),
and I personally prefer prefixing as well (it just reads better).

To be (still, but slightly less) nitpicky, I'd remove the added newline
(keep the variable declaration as a single block) and even remove the
comment - it's redundant with the attribute.

With those changes:
