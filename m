Thanks for clarifying that!

Do you know if there's any existing mechanism that we can use to silence
the warning on a per-assignment basis? Either to say that an assignment
can be overridden, or that the assignment is expected to override an
existing assignment?

If not, who would be able to look at adding a mechanism to clang for
this?

If we could have some attribute or intrinsic that we could wrap like:

struct foo f = {
	.bar __defaultval = <default>,
	.bar = <newval>,		// no warning
	.bar = <anotherval>,		// warning
};

... or:

struct foo f = {
	.bar = <default>,
	.bar __override = <newval>,	// no warning
	.bar = <anotherval>,		// warning
};

... or:
	
	.bar = OVERRIDE(<newval>),	// no warning

... or:
	OVERRIDE(.bar) = <newval>,	// no warning

... then I think it would be possible to make use of the warning
effectively, as we could distinguish intentional overrides from
unintentional ones, and annotating assignments in this way doesn't seem
onerous to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
