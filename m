We have been "forced" to wait for conference dates.  That is much
different from what we are saying here (i.e. we do NOT want to have to
wait for that type of thing as that causes us all real work that is a
total waste of engineering effort.)

I don't think we want that, waiting for long periods of time like we
have been (and are currently) is a royal pain.  We are glad to take
these on a case-by-case basis, but doing delays for no other reason than
a specific conference date 6 months in the future when we have fixes now
benifits no one at all, and in fact HURTS everyone involved, including
our users the most.

I appreciate the disclaimer :)

I know Thomas and others are totally busy with Plumbers right now (as am
I), so I'll hold on to this and your next patch in my "to-review" queue
to give others a chance to weigh in on the tweaks to see if anyone
disagrees with my comments above.

thanks,
