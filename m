I am not mounting devtmpfs. However

  CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y
  CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT=y

They are not symlinks.

These device node names represent coresight sinks(collect traces) like 
ETR, ETF, ETB and coresight sources(generates traces) like STM.

ETR and ETF are misc device registered in drivers/hwtracing/coresight
/coresight-tmc.c. However STM is not a misc device.

No I do not have any udev rules.
