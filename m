Any specific idea what that justification should be?

Because this is not something that you could measure very easily. It is
very subjective and far from black and white. And I am fully aware of
that. Hence RFC. That is why we should apply some common sense
and cost/benefit evaluation.

The cost of an additional output should be quite clear. Now we can
argue about the benefit. I argue that for an absolute majority of oom
report I have seen throughout past many years the task list was the
least useful information of the report. Sure I could go there and double
check that the victim was selected as designed. In minority cases I
could use that the task list to confirm that expected-to-be-victim had
OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN for some reason and that was why something esle has
been selected. Those configuration issues tend to be reproducible and
are easier to debug with sysctl enabled.

All that being said, arguments tend to weigh more towards IMO.
