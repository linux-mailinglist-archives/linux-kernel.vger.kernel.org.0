This still doesn't address the overhead I mentioned in my arm_mhu_v1
series.

As per you suggestion, we will have one channel with all possible
bit mask value to specify the window. Let's imagine that 2 protocols
share the same channel, then the requests are serialised.
E.g. if bits 0 and 1 are allocated for say protocol#1 and bits 2 and 3
for protocol#2.

Further protocol#1 has higher latency requirements like sched-governor
DVFS and there are 3-4 pending requests on protocol#2, then the incoming
requests for protocol#1 is blocked.

This is definitely overhead and I have seen lots of issue around this
and hence I was requesting that we need to create individual channels
for each of these. Having abstraction on top to multiplex or arbitrate
won't help.
