Kdump usually also support dumping to a remote target via NFS, SSH etc=20=

There is also =E2=80=9Cmakedumpfile=E2=80=9D that could compress and =

the vmcore size and speed up the dumping process by utilizing =

I am not sure how the system needs some minutes to reboot would be =

another system as long as it having a matching =E2=80=9Cvmlinux.".=20
