Maybe sbitmap is not a good solution, max_inodes of tmpfs are controlled by mount options--nrinodes,

which can be modified by remountfs(bigger or smaller), as the comment of function sbitmap_resize says:

 * Doesn't reallocate anything. It's up to the caller to ensure that the new
 * depth doesn't exceed the depth that the sb was initialized with.

We can modify this to meet the growing requirements, there will still be questions as follows:

1. tmpfs is a ram filesystem, we need to allocate sbitmap memory for sbinfo->max_inodes(while this maybe huge)

2.If remountfs changes  max_inode, we have to deal with it, while this may take a long time

(bigger: we need to free the old sbitmap memory, allocate new memory, copy the old sbitmap to new sbitmap

smaller: How do we deal with it?ie: we use sb->map[inode number/8] to find the sbitmap, we need to change the exist

inode numbers?while this maybe used by userspace application.)

tmpfs is same with all the other filesystems that use get_next_ino(), but we need to solve this problem one by one.

If tmpfs is ok, we can modify the other filesystems too. Besides, I do not  recommend all file systems share the same

global variable, for performance impact consideration.

Agree, thanks.
