Good Day, 

I am establishing contact in respect to administration of financial resources as your qualities match our preferred personality based on your profile from linkedin, you would be responsible for our financial representation by receiving and disbursing financial resources within the United States. Though this may not be your area of specialization, we are confident that you would be able to handle this as we would supply you with all necessary tools/instructions you need to succeed.

For more information, please write back.

We look forward to working with you.

Nozomu Amano,
