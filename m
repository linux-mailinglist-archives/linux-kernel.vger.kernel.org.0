That looks like it can be done simpler; but my head is exploding, I'll
have to look at this in the AM.

What is really important is that we never have memory that is both
writable and executable (W^X).

Moving as much poking to before marking it RO (or moving the marking RO
later if that is the same thing) is a sane approach.

But once it gains X, we must never again mark it W, without first
removing X.

I thought create_trampoline() finished the whole thing; if it does not,
either make create_trampoline() do everything, or add a
finish_trampoline() callback to mark it complete.

The fact that it is executable; also the fact that you do it right after
we mark it ro. Flipping the memory protections back and forth is just
really poor everything.

Once this ftrace thing is sorted, we'll change x86 to _refuse_ to make
executable (kernel) memory writable.

Really the best solution is to move all the poking into
ftrace_module_init(), before we mark it RO+X. That's what I'm going to
do for jump_label and static_call as well, I just need to add that extra
notifier callback.
