Yes, that's my understanding as well.

Alright, so you're saying that keeping the clock rate to HS400 speed
(decrease it after CMD6) could be fine, if we implement the above
instead?

We already use MMC_CMD_RETRIES for CMD6. Is that sufficient you think
(again assuming we implement to allow CRC errors for these CMD6
commands)?

Or are you suggesting we may need a re-try of the hole re-tune thing?
Maybe a better option is then to simply bail out and do full re-init
of the card?
