Hi Daniel,

thanks for your comments!

Refresh on these displays is *extremely* slow (1 frame per 15s), so ideally I'd want the cursor to not blink. Is there some nice way to tell the vt/console driver to do this by default?

Thanks. I'll look into that.

I suspect not. I looked into these properties, but as far as I understood they're tied to a mode, and modes are kind of static? If you want to display an animation on the epaper you might have to change these on a frame-per-frame basis. Can that be done with kms properties?

>> (3) I read that any drm driver has to be committed along with a libdrm implementation. I think the most likely interface for anyone to interact with this driver would be the fb dev. Do I have to make some userspace implementation as well anyway? If so, where would that go: libdrm or some sort of new libepaper?

phew!

>> (4) The driver accepts both XRGB8888 and RGB565 (for compatibility with small LCDs). The driver's current approach to calculate a b/w/r "ternary" image from this data is to just take the MSBs of each color component, then make anything red (R>127, G,B<=127) red, anything black (R,G,B each <=127) black and anything else white. This is since the display's default state is white, and a pixel can turn either red or black from that. Note that it's the actual pixel changing color, i.e. there is no black and red sub-pixels. If you try to drive black and red at the same time, the chip just selects red for that pixel. What are your thoughts on this interface? I was thinking about using some indexed color mode, but that would limit possible future grayscale support[7].

I think I'll rip out the rgb565 part then.

I'm aware of that and I'll rebase when that's landed.
