I just checked back to see what happened here. In our product kernel
(which does undergo build test with multiple defconfigs), we are using
v6 of these patches which did not have this issue.

I think 0-day kbuild tester could have caught the issue as well. Within
boundaries of existing infrastructure, that probably was the best bet
here. Not sure why that did not happen (probably just build scheduling).

Thanks,
Sekhar
