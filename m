Well, for VMM just an indirection and for guest, it can choose to use=20
fixed mapping, just need to program once during probe.

Let's not limit the interface to be used by a specific case :).=20
Eliminating PCIE would be appealing for other scenarios.

Is this true? I think the spec does not forbid such usages, e.g using=20
the same MSI address/command for different queues or devices?

Yes, but it's a limitation only for virtio mmio transport. We can add it.

king, so irq masking/unmasking may be optional operations.


Yes, but as you said, it helps for performance and some other cases. I=20
still prefer to implement that consider it is not complex. If we do MSI=20
without masking/unmasking, I suspect we will implement MSI-X finally=20
somedays then maintaining MSI will become a burden... (still takes=20
virtio-pci as an example, it choose to implement MSI-X not MSI).

 irq masking/unmasking is mandatory for MMIO devices.

Yes, thanks.
