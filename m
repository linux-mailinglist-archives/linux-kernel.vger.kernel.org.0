So got a chance to start implementing this and it seems like it will
work. That said, it feels like I'm duplicating logic already in the
dwc-of-simple.c implementation (which already handles arbitrary clks
and resets), particularly if I try to implement the device specific
need_reset quirk used by HiKey960 (and rk3399).

Do you feel having that logic copied is worth avoiding the extra
bindings? Or is it too duplicative?
