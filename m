Subject: [PATCH 1/1] mm/migrate: fix list corruption in migration of non-LRU movable pages

From: Qiuyang Sun <sunqiuyang@huawei.com>

Currently, after a page is migrated, it
1) has its PG_isolated flag cleared in move_to_new_page(), and
2) is deleted from its LRU list (cc->migratepages) in unmap_and_move().
However, between steps 1) and 2), the page could be isolated by another
thread in isolate_movable_page(), and added to another LRU list, leading
to list_del corruption later.

This patch fixes the bug by moving list_del into the critical section
protected by lock_page(), so that a page will not be isolated again before
it has been deleted from its LRU list.
