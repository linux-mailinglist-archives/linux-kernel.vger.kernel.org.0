Yes you are right, it would have the same issue, thanks for bringing it up.
Should we rename this bit to PTE_IDLE and do the same thing that we are doing
for swap?

i.e. if (page_idle(page)) and page is a file page, then we write state
into the PTE of the page. Later on refault, the PTE bit would automatically
get cleared (just like it does on swap-in). But before refault, the idle
tracking code sees the page as still marked idle. Do you see any issue with that?

Ok, I will improve the changelog.

Ok, lets discuss more.

thanks Michal!
