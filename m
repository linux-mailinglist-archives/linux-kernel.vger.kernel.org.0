Hi Greg,

Technically, the motivation behind this patch is to enable Linux perf tool
to attribute IO traffic to IO device.

Currently, perf tool provides interface to configure IO PMUs only 
without any
context.

Understanding IIO stack concept to find which IIO stack that particular
IO device is connected to, or to identify an IIO PMON block to program
for monitoring specific IIO stack assumes a lot of implicit knowledge
about given Intel server platform architecture.


Please consider the following mapping schema:

1. new "mapping" directory is to be added under each uncore_iio_N directory
2. that "mapping" directory is supposed to contain symlinks named "dieN"
which are pointed to corresponding root bus.
Below is how it looks like for 2S machine:

# ll uncore_iio_0/mapping/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die0 -> 
../../pci0000:00/pci_bus/0000:00
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die1 -> 
../../pci0000:80/pci_bus/0000:80

# ll uncore_iio_1/mapping/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die0 -> 
../../pci0000:17/pci_bus/0000:17
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die1 -> 
../../pci0000:85/pci_bus/0000:85

# ll uncore_iio_2/mapping/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die0 -> 
../../pci0000:3a/pci_bus/0000:3a
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die1 -> 
../../pci0000:ae/pci_bus/0000:ae

# ll uncore_iio_3/mapping/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die0 -> 
../../pci0000:5d/pci_bus/0000:5d
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jan 20 23:55 die1 -> 
../../pci0000:d7/pci_bus/0000:d7


Thanks,
Roman
