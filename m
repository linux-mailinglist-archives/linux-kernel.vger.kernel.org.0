We've been through that discussion many times and the core point is that
this requires a large surgery to work properly. It is not just to add a
sleep into the page allocator and be done with that. Page allocator
cannot really do much on its own. It relies on many other contexts to
make a forward progress. What you really demand is far from trivial.
Maybe you are looking something much closer to the RT kernel than what
other preemption modes can offer currently.

Right now, you really have to be careful when running FIFO/RT processes
and plan their resources very carefully. Is that ideal? Not really but
considering that this is the status quo for many years it seems that
the usecases tend to find their way around that restriction.
