MADV_HWPOISON stands for hard-offline.
MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE stands for soft-offline.

MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE (since Linux 2.6.33)
              Soft offline the pages in the range specified by addr and
              length.  The memory of each page in the specified range is
              preserved (i.e., when next accessed, the same content will be
              visible, but in a new physical page frame), and the original
              page is offlined (i.e., no longer used, and taken out of
              normal memory management).  The effect of the
              MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE operation is invisible to (i.e., does not
              change the semantics of) the calling process.

              This feature is intended for testing of memory error-handling
              code; it is available only if the kernel was configured with
              CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE.


But both follow different approaches.

I think it is up to some controlers to trigger soft-offline or hard-offline:

static void ghes_handle_memory_failure(struct acpi_hest_generic_data *gdata, int sev)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_ACPI_APEI_MEMORY_FAILURE
	...
        /* iff following two events can be handled properly by now */
        if (sec_sev == GHES_SEV_CORRECTED &&
            (gdata->flags & CPER_SEC_ERROR_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED))
                flags = MF_SOFT_OFFLINE;
        if (sev == GHES_SEV_RECOVERABLE && sec_sev == GHES_SEV_RECOVERABLE)
                flags = 0;

        if (flags != -1)
                memory_failure_queue(pfn, flags);
	...
#endif
 }


static void memory_failure_work_func(struct work_struct *work)
{
	...
	for (;;) {
		spin_lock_irqsave(&mf_cpu->lock, proc_flags);
		gotten = kfifo_get(&mf_cpu->fifo, &entry);
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&mf_cpu->lock, proc_flags);
		if (!gotten)
			break;
		if (entry.flags & MF_SOFT_OFFLINE)
			soft_offline_page(pfn_to_page(entry.pfn), entry.flags);
		else
			memory_failure(entry.pfn, entry.flags);
	}
 }

AFAICS, for hard-offline case, a recovered event would be if:

- the page to shut down is already free
- the page was unmapped

In some cases we need to kill the process if it holds dirty pages.

But we never migrate contents in hard-offline path.
I guess it is because we cannot really trust the contents anymore.
