Does it seem like what the c2c does?

For example, my new update is like:

struct block_dimension {
        const char              *header;
        int                     idx;
        int                     width;
        struct sort_entry       *se;
        int64_t (*cmp)(struct perf_hpp_fmt *,
                       struct hist_entry *, struct hist_entry *);
        int64_t (*sort)(struct perf_hpp_fmt *,
                        struct hist_entry *, struct hist_entry *);
        int   (*entry)(struct perf_hpp_fmt *, struct perf_hpp *,
                       struct hist_entry *);
};

struct block_fmt {
        struct perf_hpp_fmt     fmt;
        struct report           *rep;
        struct block_dimension  *dim;
};

static struct block_dimension dim_total_cycles_pct {
        .header = "Sampled Cycles%",
        .idx = PERF_HPP_REPORT__BLOCK_TOTAL_CYCLES_PCT,
        .width = 15,
        .cmp = block_info__cmp;
        .sort = block_cycles_cov_sort;
        .entry = block_cycles_cov_entry;
};

......

Is above new update correct?

OK, I will move the code for block_info collection outside of display 
function.

Looks we have to gather the block_info after the sample processing. 
That's because in each sample processing, we will call 
hist__account_cycles(). Then finally __symbol__account_cycles() gets 
called for accounting one basic block in this symbol.

ch[offset].num_aggr++;
ch[offset].cycles_aggr += cycles;

So actually, after the sample processing, we will get the num_aggr and 
cycles_aggr for this basic block and compute the average cycles for this 
block (cycles_aggr / num_aggr).

That's why I think we should gather the block_info after the sample 
processing.
