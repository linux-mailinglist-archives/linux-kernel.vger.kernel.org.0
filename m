My concern is with the last sentence "Since ima_process_keys is set to
true above, any new key will be processed immediately and not queued."
  It's unlikely, but possible, that a second process will wait for the
ima_keys_mutex.  Either we remove this sentence or move setting
ima_process_keys to after taking the lock.
