I second that and dropping the useless printk() as Michal mentioned. I 
would beg to not uglify the offlining/isolation code with __nolock 
variants or dropping locks somewhere down in a function. If everything 
fails, I rather want to see the prinkt's gone or returning details in a 
struct back to the caller, that can print it instead.

e.g.,

struct unmovable_page_info {
	const char *reason;
	struct page *page;
...
};

You should get the idea.
