If i understand, you are asking me to address additional sysfs entries 
from the client side using "default attribute" groups.
I saw your patches about "dev_groups" usage which might be part of 
5.4-rc1.
If i go with above approach, i end up seeing the soc information at two 
different sysfs paths i.e.
Is this my understanding correct?

1. /sys/devices/soc0/*
2. /sys/bus/platform/drivers/msm-socinfo/*

Couple of things which i can think of addressing this issue is:
1. Modify the soc framework APIs to pass the client side sysfs 
attributes. This will ensure all the soc information fall under 
/sys/devices/soc0/*
2. Modify "struct soc_device_attribute" and add more entries. So that we 
do not need to change any soc framework.
Problem here is others might have a different requirement which will not 
be full fill if i do this.
