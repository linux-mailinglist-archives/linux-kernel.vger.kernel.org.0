rhkramer@gmail.com:
Bradley M. Kuhn is not an attorney, which is why he had to step down as 
head
of his organization and hire a lawyer to head the organization
in his place: Bar rules do not allow lawyers to serve under a non-lawyer 
in
an organization, and the organization was essentially a pro-bono law 
firm
(which really needed a attorney in it's ranks...)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_M._Kuhn

Yes the "oh I just stepped down because we need a woman to head this 
organization
now" claim he makes is, in fact, disingenuous. What they needed is a 
lawyer in
the organization: and the lawyer could not be directed by non-lawyers.

No J.D., No law license.


I have both.

I don't want to drag someone down, but I had to correct your mistake.
Once he applies to law school, gets his degree, and later his license 
I'm sure he will correct his as well.
