So unbinding the nvme driver goes bang:

[90139.090158] nvme nvme0: failed to set APST feature (-19)
[90141.966780] Aborting journal on device dm-1-8.
[90141.967124] Buffer I/O error on dev dm-1, logical block 26247168, lost sync page write
[90141.967169] JBD2: Error -5 detected when updating journal superblock for dm-1-8.
[90141.967403] Buffer I/O error on dev dm-1, logical block 0, lost sync page write
[90141.967454] EXT4-fs (dm-1): I/O error while writing superblock
[90141.967467] EXT4-fs error (device dm-1): ext4_journal_check_start:61: Detected aborted journal
[90141.967473] EXT4-fs (dm-1): Remounting filesystem read-only

[90141.967682] EXT4-fs (dm-1): I/O error while writing superblock

and I've not managed to recover the thing yet (it's stuck trying to reboot.)

What state was your system in after unbinding the SMMU?
