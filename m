I don't know much about early_param(), so I will assume this works as you
describe.  However, a quick grep shows hugepage options for ia64 also with
early_param.

It looks like you only have short circuited/prevented nr_hugepages via
sysfs/sysctl.  Theoretically, one could set nr_overcommit_hugepages and
still allocate hugetlb pages.  So, if you REALLY want to shut things down
you need to stop this as well.

There is already a macro hugepages_supported() that can be set by arch
specific code.  I wonder how difficult it would be to 'overwrite' the
macro if nohugepages is specified.  Perhaps just a level of naming
indirection.  This would use the existing code to prevent all hugetlb usage.

It seems like there may be some discussion about 'the right' way to
do kdump.  I can't add to that discussion, but if such an option as
nohugepages is needed, I can help.
