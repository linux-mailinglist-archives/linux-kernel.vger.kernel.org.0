Sorry, my bad, ia64 does not have NODES_SPAN_OTHER_NODES, but it does have
HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP.

I remember I've tried killing HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP, but I've run into
some problems and then I've got distracted. I too would like to have
HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP go away, maybe I'll take another look at it.

It's O(log(N)) where N is the amount of the memory banks (ie. memblock.memory.cnt)
