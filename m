I'm not a lawyer etc. but AIUI the date above is about the authorship,
ie. when it was originally written, not when it was published or
committed.

In general I don't think it matters too much, but in this case I'm
pretty sure Anshuman can't have possibly written it in 2019 on behalf of
IBM :)

So we can either change the date to 2018, or drop his name and just say
it's copyright 2019 by IBM.

cheers
