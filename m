That would seem fair but I do think it's something that could be done
later (maybe 1 release away?) to avoid a false bisection to this patch by
accident. I don't *think* there are any machines out there with a 1-hop
distance of 14 but if there is, your patch would make a difference to
MM behaviour.  In the same context, it might make sense to rename the
value to somewhat reflective of the fact that "reclaim distance" affects
scheduler placement. No good name springs to mind at the moment.
