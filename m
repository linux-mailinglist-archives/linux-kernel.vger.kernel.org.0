Thanks.  Sasha's proposed changes do address the two issues I pointed
out, so are an improvement.  However:

I also agree with this.

Yes, we should update the link, but maybe we should also drop the
posting e-mail address, which will ensure someone will have to check out
the link before they're able to post.  This should allow us to drop the
summary of linux-distros policy and posting instructions, although maybe
they're beneficial to keep if we're confident we'd be maintaining this
summary to reflect possible changes on the linked page.

OK.
