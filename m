Note, this is done at every sched switch, for both next and prev tasks.
And the update is only done at the enabling of a tracepoint (very rare
occurrence) If it missed it scheduling in, it has a really good chance
of getting it while scheduling out.

And 99.999% of my tracing that I do, the tasks scheduling in when
enabling a tracepoint is not what I even care about, as I enable
tracing then start what I want to trace.

I'm more OK with using a READ_ONCE() on the flags so it is consistent.
But the WRITE_ONCE() is going a bit overboard.

Which part of the code are you talking about here?
