That's exactly what I'm proposing. I think you're misunderstanding me.

I want the owner to handle all the list deletion work from the target.

Ok let's imagine a timer $ITIMER, owned by task $OWNER and whose target is task $TARGET.

So it's enqueued on $OWNER->signal->posix_timers and $TARGET->cputime_expires.

Two scenarios can happen:

1) $TARGET exits first and is released. So it calls posix_cpu_timers_exit()
   which deletes $ITIMER from $TARGET->cputime_expires.

   Later on, $OWNER exits and calls exit_itimers() -> timer_delete_hook($ITIMER)
   -> posix_cpu_timer_del($ITIMER). It finds $TARGET as the target of $ITIMER but no
   more sighand. So it returns.

2) $OWNER exits first and calls exit_itimer() -> timer_delete_hook($ITIMER)
   -> posix_cpu_timer_del($ITIMER). It finds $TARGET as the target of $ITIMER and it
   finds a sighand to lock. So it deletes $ITIMER from $TARGET->cputime_expires
   (see list_del(&timer->it.cpu.entry)).


So I propose to change the behaviour of case 1) so that $TARGET doesn't call
posix_cpu_timers_exit(). We instead wait for $OWNER to exit and call
exit_itimers()  -> timer_delete_hook($ITIMER) -> posix_cpu_timer_del($ITIMER).
It is going to find $TARGET as the target of $ITIMER but no more sighand. Then
finally it removes $ITIMER from $TARGET->cputime_expires.
We basically do the same thing as in 2) but without locking sighand since it's NULL
on $TARGET at this time.

I hope I'm less confusing (if not confused).

Thanks.
