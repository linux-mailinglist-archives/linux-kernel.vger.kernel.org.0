You are right on the premise. The whole knob thing came into existence
because I couldn't make the first level of search work conserving. I am
concerned that trying to make that work conserving can introduce
significant latency in the code path when SA is used. I have made the
second level of search work conserving when we search the LLC domain.

Having said that, SA need not necessarily be binary i.e only spill over to
the allowed set if the preferred set is 100% utilized (work conserving).
The spill over can happen before that and SA can have a degree of softness.

The above two points made me go down the knob path for the first level of
search.
