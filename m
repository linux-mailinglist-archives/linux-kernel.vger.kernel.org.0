Right, expected.

My bad, the other SID is 0x6D6.

Yea, one for GSI, and the other one for non-GSI DMA. I am unsure at this point
about the use of TZ SID, but i would assume this is the SID that's used by the
qup firmware, and therefore on MTP TZ programs this SID.

Sorry my bad, I missed the overriding part.
May be we add the lists of SIDs in board dts only. So, cheza dts will
have all these SIDs -
<&apps_smmu 0x6c0 0x3>   // for both 0x6c0 (TZ) and 0x6c3 (HLOS)
<&apps_smmu 0x6d6 0x0>   // if we want to use the GSI dma.
and
MTP will have
<&apps_smmu 0x6c3 0x0>
<&apps_smmu 0x6d6 0x0>
WDUT?

The other SID was 0x6D6.
