Hmm.

Right now, arm64 selects REFCOUNT_FULL, since I think it's important for
us to have this hardening enabled given the sorts of places we find
ourselves deployed. If the race above is a viable attack vector, then I'd
stick with the status quo, however Kees previously wrote this off as
"unrealistic":

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAGXu5jLXFA4=X5mC9ph9dZ0ZJaVkGXd2p1Vh8jH_EE15kVL6Hw@mail.gmail.com

and I'm inclined to agree with him given the conditions involved.

My understanding is that the current !FULL implementation (x86 only)
simply doesn't detect certain cases such as increment-from-zero, which
I think is different from being exposed to a theoretical race condition
involving billions of tasks each preempting each other one-by-one within
a handful of instructions. Even then, we'll still WARN!
