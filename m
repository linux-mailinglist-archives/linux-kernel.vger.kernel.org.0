Thrashing means more IPIs right? That's not what I observed, because idle task
has less chance onto CPU, rescheduling is reduced accordingly.

Yeah, I understand and agree with this, but 10-15% idle time on an overloaded
system makes me to try to figure out how this could happen and if we
can improve it.

Thrashing is not observed under an overloaded case but may happen under a
light load or a mid load case, I need more investigation.

Okay, thanks, it looks like the core functions pick_next_task() and pick_task()
have a lot of changes against v2. Need more brain power..

Is there any potential change between pre v3 and v3? I prefer working
based on v3 so that everyone are on the same page.
