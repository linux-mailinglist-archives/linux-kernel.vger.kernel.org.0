Got it, thanks.

Human readers probably depend on more on tabulation and white space.
When the preceding description wasn't using a colon to begin with (and
you just replace s/\./:/) it can even look weird, but no big deal.

But kernel-doc has a documented format, which was sort of the point I
was trying to make. If the new get_abi.pl scripts expects a colon I
think it should be mentioned somewhere (e.g. Documentation/ABI/README).

Grepping for attribute entries in linux-next still reveals a number
descriptions that still lack that colon and use varying formatting. More
are bound to be added later, but perhaps that's ok depending on what
you're aiming at here.
