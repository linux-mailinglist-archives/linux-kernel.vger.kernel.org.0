Right.   The question for now is: should the freeze silently succeed
(as it seems to do now) or should it fail instead?

I guess normally freezing should be okay, as long as the virtiofsd
remains connected while the system is frozen.

I tried to test this with "echo -n mem > /sys/power/state", which
indeed resulted in the virtio_fs_freeze() callback being called.
However, I couldn't find a way to wake up the system...

Thanks,
Miklos
