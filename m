Which is in a simplified view is what address range the DMA can address.
The DMA can not generate address beyond the mask.

True.

I see.

Hrm, why it is not correct?
The DMA can generate addresses up to 32 bits. Anything beyond that is
not accessible by DMA.
The interconnect makes part of a higher (not addressable memory space)
available within the 32 bits range, thus the DMA can address that.
We tell this via the dma-ranges.
I agree that for a correct dma-ranges for k2g should be:
dma-ranges = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x80000000>,
             <0x80000000 0x8 0x00000000 0x80000000>;

I agree on the phys_to_dma(). It should fail for addresses which does
not fall into any of the ranges.
It is just a that we in Linux don't have the concept atm for ranges, we
have only _one_ range which applies to every memory address.

I guess what I'm proposing is to _not_ apply the phys_to_dma() to the
DMA mask itself?

Or reverse check the dma-ranges against the dma_mask?

0x0 - 0x8000 0000 : direct mapped w/o pfn_offset
0x8000 0000 - 0xFFFF FFFF : mapped from 0x8 0000 0000 w/ pfn_offset

and this is the whole address range the DMA can address.

I understand that this is a bit more complex than I interpret it, but
the k2g is broken and currently the simplest way to make it work is to
use the arm dma_ops in case the pfn_offset is not 0.
It will be easy to test dma-direct changes trying to address the issue
in hand, but will allow k2g to be usable at the same time.
