This is what I mean in the commit message by:

So the expectation is that the caller takes care of it.

However, having checked again, it appears that mm/hmm.c now does use
this callback (merged in v5.2-rc1).

Jérôme - are you happy with this change in semantics? It looks like
hmm_vma_walk_pud() should deal gracefully with both normal and large
pages - although I'm unsure whether you are relying on the lock from
pud_trans_huge_lock()?

Thanks,

Steve
