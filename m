In fact there is no much difference that it is defined in acrn.h or one 
separate header file.
When it is sent with the driver stuff, I will add the hypercall into 
acrn.h. If the further extension is needed, we can then consider whether 
it is necessary to be moved into the separate header file.

My initial thought is that the acrn.h/acrn_hypercall.h defines the 
different contents.  Then the each source file in ACRN driver part can 
include "acrn.h" or "acrn_hypercall.h" based on its requirement.
Of course it is also ok that they are added in one header file. Then it 
is always included.

Sure.
