Anecdotally, it appears to be a fairly common problem for 32-bit capable
DMA masters to hit fragmentation problems with the current IOVA allocator
but yes, some numbers to show how that is improved using best-fit (as
opposed to e.g. worst-fit) are definitely required here.

It might be that we can simply swizzle the algorithm to focus on reduced
fragmentation for smaller (i.e. 32-bit) address spaces, but leave larger
domains with the current approach to avoid increasing the allocation
overhead.
