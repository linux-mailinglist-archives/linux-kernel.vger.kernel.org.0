Besides other still open considerations on latency, I spotted one certainly
not strictly needed event-payload-sized memcpy that I'm going to remove so as
to have only the bare minimum bytes copied in and out the queues. (it will
complicate a bit the code in the worker but not dramatically)
I'll do that not in today v3 but in the next v4 (due anyway to solve some
residual initialization corner cases).

Thanks
