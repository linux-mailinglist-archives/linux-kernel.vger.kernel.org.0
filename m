Let me explain, something more.

According to bsp there are clk_info.tcon_div which I will explain below.
clk_info.dsi_div which is dynamic and it depends on bpp/lanes, so it
is 6 for 24bpp and 4 lanes devices.

PLL rate here depends on dsi_div (not tcon_div)

Code here
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M64-bsp/blob/master/linux-sunxi/drivers/video/sunxi/disp2/disp/de/disp_lcd.c#L784

is computing the actual set rate, which depends on dsi_rate.

lcd_rate = dclk_rate * clk_info.dsi_div;
dsi_rate = pll_rate / clk_info.dsi_div;

Say if the dclk_rate 148MHz then the dsi_rate is 888MHz which set rate
for above link you mentioned.

Here are the evidence with some prints.

tcon_div from BSP point-of-view of there are two variants
00) clk_info.tcon_div which is 4 and same is set the divider position
in SUN4I_TCON0_DCLK_REG (like above link refer)
01) tcon_div which is 4 and used for edge timings computation
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M64-bsp/blob/master/linux-sunxi/drivers/video/sunxi/disp2/disp/de/lowlevel_sun50iw1/de_dsi.c#L12

The real reason for 01) is again 4 is they set the divider to 4 in 00)
which is technically wrong because the dividers which used during
dotclock in above (dsi_div) should be used here as well. Since there
is no dynamic way of doing this BSP hard-coding these values.

Patches 5,6,7 on this series doing this
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/60847/

Hope this explanation helps?
