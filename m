Looking at the x86 kexec EFI code, it seems that it has special
handling for the legacy SMBIOS table address, but not for the SMBIOS3
table address, which was introduced to accommodate SMBIOS tables
living in memory that is not 32-bit addressable.

Could anyone check whether these systems provide SMBIOS 3.0 tables,
and whether their address gets virtually remapped at ExitBootServices?
