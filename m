Not sure we should modify this for someone's downstream tree to work
around an issue they introduced.  If you want to file a bug
internally, I'd be happy to comment on it.

Does __builtin_memset detect support for `rep stosb`, then patch the
kernel to always use it or not?  The kernel is limited in that we use
-mno-sse and friends to avoid saving/restoring vector registers on
context switch unless kernel_fpu_{begin|end}() is called, which the
compiler doesn't insert for memcpy's.

Did you verify what this change does for other compilers?

Sounds like a linkage error or issue with symbol visibility; I don't
see how -ffreestanding should have any bearing on that.

I disagree.  The codegen in the kernel is very tricky to get right;
it's somewhat an embedded system, yet provides many symbols that would
have been provided by libc, yet it doesn't use vector operations for
the general case.  Adding -ffreestanding to optimize one hot memset in
one function is using a really big hammer to solve the wrong problem.
