That's a very good point.

What we have for debug UART etc is explicitly just for
debugging on one specific platform and not for production
code.

But as pointed out there is code like this already.

Not much to do about that, we need to support it already and
adding another usecase just makes it more reasonable to
support I think.

What we need to think about is whether we can imagine some
solution that would work with multiplatform.

At one point we discussed putting some easily accessible
values in the device tree for the "decompressing...." message,
so easy to get at that the decompressor could access them
easily, or even providing a small binary code snippet in the
DTB file to write to the UART. None of this worked out
IIUC.

I think nothing really materialized from this and the problem
is swept under the carpet: no decompress messages for
multiplatform. I tried to think about something and just feel
I would be reinventing mach-types.

Do we have an idea of whether it is possible to dig into
a DTB in early boot and find the node for the UART and
watchdog and use the physical address from there?
Is it really hard or is it just that no-one tried?
(Sorry if this is a naive question...)

Yours,
Linus Walleij
