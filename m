[Abhinav] The display driver for MSM chipsets relies on the drm_edid.c 
parsing for the CEA extension blocks. The parts which use this shall be 
posted later when we post our changes for HDR support for the display 
driver for MSM chipset. Meanwhile, if there are no further concerns on 
this, we would like to go ahead with this change and get it merged as 
its an important bug fix. Thanks.
