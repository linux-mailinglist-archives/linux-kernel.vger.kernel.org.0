I assume you mean LTC3883, not LTC3888.

I have always judged that checking this bit has no value, and it can be problematic. If the part is set to have a very long transition rate, like 5 seconds, this would hang the call for a long time. That seemed bad to me, and is why I did not poll this bit.

Your call, really. My major concern was that bit 5 is no longer polled
on LTC3883. From the above, it looks like it actually _is_ the pending
bit (5) that isn't supported on LTC3883. With that in mind, I'll apply
the series as-is and add the Fixes: tag myself; no need to resend.
