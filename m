The reasons for allocating a new model number are a mystery.
I've seen cases where I thought we'd get a new numnber for sure,
but then just bumped the stepping. I've also seen us allocate a
new number when it didn't look needed (to me, from my OS perspective).

As I mentioned above, there are some folks internally that think
NP == Network Processor is too narrow a pigeonhole for this CPU.

But _NPAOS (Network Processor And Other Stuff) doesn't sound helpful.

I'm sure that we will invent all sorts of strings for the "OPTDIFF"
part of the name (many of which will only be used once or twice).

Rationale for "AIRMONT2" is that this is derived from Airmont. So
you'd expect many model specific bits of code to do the same for
this as they did for plain AIRMONT. But in a few corner cases there
will be separate code.

Perhaps I need to update the rubric that I just added to the
head on intel-family.h to say that the MICROARCH element may
be followed by an optional number to differentiate SOCs that
use essentially the same core, but have different model numbers
because of SOC differences outside of the core.
