Thank you for your response!
It's true that the problem still exist if they are not the same£¨I
thougt they can't both exist£©. Perhaps I can do the renaming for both.

To avoid the race, I think we can take the lock 'blk_trace_mutex' while
renaming 'bt->dir'.

The deap loop will exist if 'debugfs_rename' keep failing for some
reason. I thougt about setting a limit for max loop count, however, It's
probably not a good solution.

Thanks!
