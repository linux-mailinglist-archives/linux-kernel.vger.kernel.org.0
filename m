This is a misunderstanding. I probably was not clear enough. It makes
perfect sense to have separate APIs for numlist and dataring. I agree
that they allow to split the problem into smaller pieces.

I only think that, especially, numlist API is too generic in v4.
It is not selfcontained. The consistency depends on external barriers.

I believe that it might become fully self-contained and consistent
if we reduce possibilities of the generic usage. In particular,
the numlist should allow only linking of reusable structures
stored in an array.

I explained in the previous mail that other use cases are
questionable. If anyone really finds another usecase,
the API might be made more generic. But we should start
with something simple.

I would actually go the other way. It would be nice to add numlist
and dataring API in separate patches.

I understand. I hope that it is more clear now.
