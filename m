No longer relevant with the changes below, but for completeness, I was trying to
refer to drm_atomic_crtc_state_for_each_plane and friends. I see now that I
wasn't terribly clear :)

Yeah, I wasn't particularly interested in encoders not in state. I had
considered going the connector route, but since you can have multiple connectors
per encoder, going through crtc seemed a bit more direct.

It seems like we could just tweak this function a bit to get the new or old crtc
for an encoder. Any particular reason for going through connector instead? Is it
to avoid the encoder_mask which is a helper thing? In that case, perhaps this
should use connector links and live in drm_atomic.c?

Thanks for the review!
