Good luck with that. As Miquel said, on most NAND controllers
select_target() is a dummy operation that just assigns nand_chip->target
to the specified value but doesn't assert the CS line. You could send a
dummy command here, like a READ_ID, but I guess you need CS to be
asserted for at least 20ns before asserting any other signals (CLE/ALE)
which might be an issue.

Just looked at the datasheet, and there's actually more than tCRDP:

- you have to make sure you entered power-down state for at least tDPDD
  before you try to wake up the device
- the device goes back to stand-by state tRDP after the CS pin has been
  deasserted.

I guess we can use ndelay() for those, since they happen before/after
the CS pin is asserted/de-asserted. Be careful with ndelay() though,
it's not guaranteed to wait the the time you pass, it can return
before (maybe we should add a helper to deal with that).
Another solution would be to describe CS assertion/de-assertion in
the instruction flow, but that requires patching all exec_op() drivers.

For the tCRDP timing, I think we should use a nand_operation, this way
we can check if the controller is able to deal with dummy CS-assertion
before entering deep-power mode.
In order to do that you'll have to add a NAND_OP_DUMMY_INSTR (or
NAND_OP_DELAY_INSTR), and then have something like:

struct nand_op_instr instrs[] = {
	NAND_OP_DUMMY(tCRDP),
};
