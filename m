Having copies of driver specific uapi headers is rather common,
and you won't have much success trying to get everyone to change
that.

The reasons why those applications do it are:

- The kernel already gives ABI guarantees so anything built with an
   old header file is expected to keep working indefinitely.
- Using a new header file won't help unless the application also
   knows about the added interfaces
- If an application uses more recent additions to the kernel headers,
  it either has to have a matching version of that header, or use a long
  series of #ifdef checks to deal with arbitrary versions.

The case that we are interested in is drivers that previously used
platform data in legacy board files that have since been replaced
with dtb based boots.

It's been done before, but usually with overlays that don't necessarily
make it any better than platform data. If you have a set of drivers where
one of them creates a platform device for the other driver, then platform
data is usually the easiest way, and I'm not aware of any move to
get rid of that.

As an alternative, you can use the generalized property support
from include/linux/property.h that works on top of DT, ACPI or
plain platform devices.
