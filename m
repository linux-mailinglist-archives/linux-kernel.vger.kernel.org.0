Hi Morten,

Just as a heads-up, I think those changes would better fit 2/3, or be
in their own patch. 1/3 is just a straight up code move, with no changes
to the existing comments.

Right, it's not a hard guarantee.

Sounds good.

Right, I don't think I've seen anything recent that uses that flag.

Agreed! I actually already have that one in 2/3.

Ack.

This probably dates back to when ASYM_PACKING was really just for
bubbling tasks up to the first CPU of each core, and hasn't been changed
when the asym_priority thing was introduced. I can add a pointer to that.
