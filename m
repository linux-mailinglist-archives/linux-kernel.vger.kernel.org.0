I don't like the trans_pgd_ name either, but I can't think of anything better, and its
only a name.

Please avoid the word 'subsystem',

Yup, all implied in the work of creation.

Which one is this?
The existing hibernate code has two PGD. One for the copy of the linear-map, one for this
safe page that contains the code doing the copying.

I think you are over generalising this, to support a case that doesn't exist.

Hibernate needs a copy of the linear map to relocate memory, without stepping in
page-table, and an executable page it can do that from.

To get kexec to relocate the kernel with the MMU on... you need the same.

When do you need to add an arbitrary page to either of these sets of tables? Its either a
copy of the linear-map, or the single executable page.

When would does 'trans_pgd_map_page()' get used outside those two?

(looking in your later series, I see you are using it to try and idmap stuff into the low
memory. We can't do stuff like this because there may not be any memory in range of the
page table helpers. More details in that patch)


Thanks,

James
