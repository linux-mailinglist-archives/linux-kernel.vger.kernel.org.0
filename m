Just a quick note, the snippest I posted:

    https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190914150206.GA2270@darwi-home-pc

is not PID 1.

It's just a lowly process called "systemd-random-seed". Its main
reason of existence is to load/restore a random seed file from and to
disk across reboots (just like what sysv scripts did).

The reason I posted it was to show that if we change getrandom() to
silently return weak crypto instead of blocking or an error code,
systemd-random-seed will break: it will save the resulting data to
disk, then even _credit_ it (if asked to) in the next boot cycle
through RNDADDENTROPY.

Yeah, because the problem was/is not with systemd :)

It is GDM/gnome-session which was blocking the graphical boot process.

Regarding reproducing the issue, through a quick trace_prink, all of
below processes are calling getrandom() on my Arch system at boot:

    https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190912034421.GA2085@darwi-home-pc

The fatal call was gnome-session's one, because gnome didn't continue
_its own_ boot due to this blockage.

It seems Arch is good at triggering this. For example, here is a
another Arch user on a Thinkpad (different model than mine), also with
GDM getting blocked on entropy:

    https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=248035
    
    "As you can see, the system is literally waiting a half minute for
    something - up until crng init is done"

(The NetworkManager logs are just noise. I also had them, but completely
 disabling NetworkManager didn't do anything .. just made the logs
 cleaner)
