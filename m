Works for me. Yet, I guess I tried that, back on 2017. 

If I'm not mistaken, the initial patchset to solve the broken things 
won't be small, and will be require a lot of attention in order to
identify what's broken and where.

Btw, one thing is to pass at ReST validation. Another thing is to
produce something that people can read. 

Right now, the pertinent logic at the script I wrote (scripts/get_abi.pl)
is here:

                if (!($desc =~ /^\s*$/)) {
                        if ($desc =~ m/\:\n/ || $desc =~ m/\n[\t ]+/  || $desc =~ m/[\x00-\x08\x0b-\x1f\x7b-\xff]/) {
                                # put everything inside a code block
                                $desc =~ s/\n/\n /g;

                                print "::\n\n";
                                print " $desc\n\n";
                        } else {
                                # Escape any special chars from description
                                $desc =~s/([\x00-\x08\x0b-\x1f\x21-\x2a\x2d\x2f\x3c-\x40\x5c\x5e-\x60\x7b-\xff])/\\$1/g;

                                print "$desc\n\n";
                        }
                }

If it discovers something weird enough, it just places everything
into a comment block. Otherwise, it assumes that it is a plain
text and that any special characters should be escaped.

If the above block is replaced by a simple:

		print "$desc\n\n";

The description content will be handled as a ReST file.

I don't have any time right now to do this change and to handle the
warnings that will start to popup.

Btw, a single replace there is enough to show the amount of problems that
it will rise, as it will basically break Sphinx build with:

	reading sources... [  1%] admin-guide/abi-testing
	reST markup error:
	get_abi.pl rest --dir $srctree/Documentation/ABI/testing:45261: (SEVERE/4) Missing matching underline for section title overline.
	
	==========================
	PCIe Device AER statistics
	These attributes show up under all the devices that are AER capable. These

Thanks,
Mauro
