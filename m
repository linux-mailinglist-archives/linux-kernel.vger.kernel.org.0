I have already forgot this discussion... But after I glanced at this code again
I still think the same, and I don't understand why do you disagree.

Sure, and I was only talking about x86. We can keep TIF_NOHZ and even
set_tsk_thread_flag(TIF_NOHZ) in context_tracking_cpu_set() if some arch needs
this but remove TIF_NOHZ from TIF_WORK_SYSCALL_ENTRY in arch/x86/include/asm/thread_info.h,
afaics this shouldn't make any difference.

And I see no reason why x86 needs to use TIF_WORK_SYSCALL_ENTRY in
syscall_trace_enter().
