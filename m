I agree - distros that are not sure or don't care about key measurement 
are anyway not going to choose this option. Only those that really care 
will opt in.

My goal is to not burden the vast majority of the users with this 
additional overhead if they don't need it - particularly, small systems 
such as embedded devices, etc.

If you have suggestions for how I can handle it in a different way 
(other than config option), I'll be happy to try it out.
