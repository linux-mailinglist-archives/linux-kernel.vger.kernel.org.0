/me confused. Is ETZPC accessible from the non-secure kernel space to
begin with ? If so, is it allowed to configure hardware blocks as secure
or trusted ? I am failing to understand the overall design of a system
with ETZPC controller.

I strongly have to disagree with the above and NACK any patch trying
to do so. AFAIK, no system designed has TZC with non-secure access.
So we simply can't access this in the kernel and hence need no driver
for the same. Please avoid adding above misleading information in future.
