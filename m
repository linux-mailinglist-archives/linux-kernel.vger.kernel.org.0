From my POV, it does not make much sense.

I am not able to find it. I only see that empty continuous framgments
are ignored in log_output(). Normal empty lines seems to be strored.

Well, I can't see any usecase for this. I think that we could ignore
all empty strings.

Sounds godo to me.

Yeah. They will see bump in the seq number. We would need to
distinguish empty records and lost records as you wrote above.
It looks better to ignore empty records already during write.
