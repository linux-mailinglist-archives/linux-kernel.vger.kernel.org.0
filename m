Use of DT_SCHEMA_FILES hiding problems or having to run 'make
dt_binding_check' on everything?

I could probably rework things such that you can check a single
binding example against all schema, but dtbs still get validated by
just a single schema.

The other option is proper makefiles in every directory so you can do
'make Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clk/'. But like compiling a
directory, that doesn't catch all issues (linking).

Yes, that's really where DT_SCHEMA_FILES is most useful IMO.

Been waiting on the fix to be applied since Dec...

Probably is. There are cases where a new schema breaks another file's
example. If someone has a gcc node in another example for example.
