From: Igor Opaniuk <igor.opaniuk@toradex.com>

1. Replace boiler plate licenses texts with the SPDX license
identifiers in Toradex i.MX7-based SoM device trees.
2. As X11 is identical to the MIT License, but with an extra sentence
that prohibits using the copyright holders' names for advertising or
promotional purposes without written permission, use MIT license instead
of X11 ('s/X11/MIT/g').
