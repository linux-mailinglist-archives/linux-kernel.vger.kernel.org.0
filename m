Hi Martin,

Thanks for your comment.

I would not say there is a fundamental difference since reset is a 
really simple

stuff from all reset drivers.  However, it did have some difference

from existing reset-lantiq.c since SoC becomes more and more complex.

1. reset-lantiq.c use index instead of register offset + bit position.

index reset is good for a small system (< 64). However, it will become very

difficult to use if you have  > 100 reset. So we use register offset + 
bit position

2. reset-lantiq.c does not support device restart which is part of the 
reset in

old lantiq SoC. It moved this part into arch/mips/lantiq directory.

3. reset-lantiqc reset callback doesn't implement what hardware implemented

function. In old SoCs, some bits in the same register can be hardware 
reset clear.

It just call assert + assert. For these SoCs, we should only call 
assert, hardware

will auto deassert.

4. Code not optimized and intel internal review not assessed.

Based on the above findings, I would suggest reset-lantiq.c to move to 
reset-intel-syscon.c

What is your opinion?
