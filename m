You could declare R/O MMIO region in controla and set up a translation using ranges
from slave's reg CS based reg mapping like:

+	hbmc: hyperbus@47034000 {
+		compatible = "ti,am654-hbmc";
+		reg = <0x0 0x47034000 0x0 0x100>,
+			<0x5 0x00000000 0x1 0x0000000>;
+		#address-cells = <2>;
+		#size-cells = <1>;
+		ranges = <0x0 0x0 0x5 0x00000000 0x4000000>, /* CS0 - 64MB */
+			 <0x1 0x0 0x5 0x04000000 0x4000000>; /* CS1 - 64MB */
+
+		/* Slave flash node */
+		flash@0,0 {
+			compatible = "cypress,hyperflash", "cfi-flash";
+			reg = <0x0 0x0 0x4000000>;
+		};
+	};

If you use just CS# how would you handle CS to MMIO region mapping? 
Does both CS use the same MMIO base for reads?

If multiple CS use same MMIO base, then I can make this part of code non fatal
when reg entry is a single cell and introduce notion of CS like SPI
