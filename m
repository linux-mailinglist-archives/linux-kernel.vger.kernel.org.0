Hi,

(CC: +devicetree list:
memreserving the initrd, which linux then frees causes a zombie memreserve in all future
kexec'd kernels)

(well, it generates the second DT, and it has the reserved /proc/iomem entries on hand)

Aha! Ugh.
arm64_memblock_init() memblock_reserves() this, as does fdt_init_reserved_mem().
But then we memblock_free() it in free_initrd_mem().

Right, so the options are:

(1) Delete the memreserve node from the DT when we free the initrd. I don't think this is
the sort of thing the kernel should be doing.

(2) Memreserving the initramfs implies 'keepinitrd' on the commandline. The DT has told us
to "exclude reserved memory from normal usage". If the bootloader didn't mean for us to
reserve this memory forever, it should drop the memreserve.

(3) kexec-tools determines this memreserve is no longer needed and removes it from the new
DT. It has the details to do this: /sys/firmware/fdt will show the physical addresses of
the initramfs. With your patch /proc/iomem will show that this region is regular memory.
(not covered by any reserved type). This is safe with older kernels.


My preference is 2 then 3.

If we've freed the memory and we can update that file, sure.
I think at the time of that patch the assumption was only the arch code does
memblock_reserve() early, so we never need to update /proc/iomem.
