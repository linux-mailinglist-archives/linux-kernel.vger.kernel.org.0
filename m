So that we know how often or where kernel entries happen,
how long every kernel execution is, and also can do an accurate break
down.

Okay. Can you provide details? When will it go away?

Anyways KVM async is just one case, my patch covers lots of other cases
too. Even if KVM async goes away it still makes sense
for the other entry points and can be easily rebased (just drop
that hunk)
