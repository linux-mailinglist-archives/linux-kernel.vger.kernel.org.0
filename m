we have custom hardware, so this was needed. But we used std. parts
with existing drivers, so the upcomming problems were hidden in details.
Of cause we tested the hardware but you can find only obvious problems.

We have noticed that also, *active* is a big point.

I used linux-arm and it worked surprisingly well (not all mails went truh the list)
but it look very silent and i was unsure if they were still alive. A big win
for everyone would be a FAQ/Lessons-learned something you can take to check a contract.
the customer will know what to expect and the contractor will know what to offer.

Having something a list of minimum requirements like that FAQ would improve the stand of
the hardware developed to support linux. Not everyone has a big budget or need to
produce in millions like the raspi guys did, and even they have sometimes troubles.

note: that will not solve every proble but even a starting point would be good.
