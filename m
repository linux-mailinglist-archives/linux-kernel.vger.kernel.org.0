I'm confused.  All I see so far is objections about some documentation
in comments that can be cleaned up, and a disagreement about the name of
some things (naming is hard, tie goes to the submitter).

But no logic issues, right?  Documentation and names can be fixed
anytime, the logic is all working properly, right?

What am I missing here?
