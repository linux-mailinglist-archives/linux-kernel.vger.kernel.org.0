Looks like I managed to figure out what's really going on:

  1. The BCM4329 doc clearly states that High Speed is supported, see
page 49 (Section 11: WLAN Interfaces, SDIO v1.2)

https://www.cypress.com/file/298626/download

  2. I googled for performance results of the BCM4329 SDIO WiFi and came
to a conclusion that ~40 Mbit/s is a realistic maximum of the WiFi-data
throughput for NVIDIA Tegra20 boards due to antenna configuration
limitations and whatever.

  3. The Tegra's SDHCI clock is pre-configured to 48MHz at the time of
kernel's boot-up.

  4. IIUC, the maximum clock rate for the legacy SD signaling mode is
~25MHz and that is more than enough for a 4-lane SDIO data-bus that
allows up to 100 Mbit/s for the WiFi which is capped to 40 Mbit/s anyways.

  5. Apparently MMC core doesn't limit the clock rate for the Normal
Speed cards.


So, I added "max-frequency = <25000000>;" to the SDHCI node of the
board's device-tree and ta-da! WiFi works absolutely fine without the
quirk! Thus the SDIO card quirk isn't really needed and I'm dropping it
for now.

Ulf, do you know if it's a bug or a feature of the MMC core that it
doesn't limit clock rate for the Normal Speed cards?
