I agree it should, but unfortunately that is not the case; when I first
posted the patch I was concerned that for a regulator to be supported by
this driver it should obey to the driver's internals (ie: comply with
all of the spmi_common_regulator_registers definitions).

However, since there was just a single range to support, the
modifications I had to do to support this SPMI regulator were minimal -
hence why I opted for the changes under discussion instead of writing a
new driver (which IMO it is an overkill).

what do you think?

ah, this definition I can remove and use the common one above. I'll do that.
