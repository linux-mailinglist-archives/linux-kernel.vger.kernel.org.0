So: you just made me realize that I'm not actually sure whether there's any
point to us clearing port->available_pbn here since the available_pbn (at
least the value that we cache on initial link address probing for bandwidth
constraint checking) shouldn't actually change on a port just because of a
hotplug. I bet this is probably causing more problems on it's own as well,
since reprobing the available_pbn might actually give us a value that reflects
allocations on other ports that are already in place.

So: I think what I'm going to do instead is make it so that we never clear
port->available_pbn; mainly to make things less complicated during
suspend/resume, since we want to make sure there's always some sort of PBN
value populated even during the middle of reprobing the link address on
resume. That way we don't have to pretend that it's ever disconnected either.
Will send a respin in a bit.
