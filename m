Some of the refcount_t tests don't trigger a WARN(), and there are
related benchmarking tests that don't either.

Sorry for my confusing reply! I meant that I don't want to apply the
patch, but I'm find to leave the stackleak check in LKDTM.

However, if you want to split it out into its own test, I think that
should be fine; similar to lib/test_user_copy.c if you want it to stand
alone and have its own semantics, etc.

I don't, unfortunately. The real "difficulty" is that some of the
crashes are architecture-specific (e.g. how MMU traps are reported
across different architectures), so it's not too easy to consolidate
the reporting. As a result, I've taken to trying to do best-effort on
the test running side. I'll send what I've got...
