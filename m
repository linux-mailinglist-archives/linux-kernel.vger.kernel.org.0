Pfff... Working blind without the HPG sucks...

I agree that it should be done separately.
I'll send a patch on top of yours.

Thanks for checking.

Here are my observations for a 8998 board:

1) If I apply only the readl_poll_timeout() fix (not the mask_pcs_ready fixup)
qcom_pcie_probe() fails with a timeout in phy_init.
=> this is in line with your regression analysis.

2) Your patch also fixes a long-standing bug in UFS init whereby sending
lots of information to the console during phy init would lead to an
incorrectly diagnosed time-out.

Good stuff!
