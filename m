Hi Thomas,

BTW, what email client do you use, because your replies seem to confuse
my email client (claws-mail) and it doesn't thread them at all.
Although they do look fine on mutt (when I view my LKML folder). Looks
like it doesn't create a "References:" header.

Hmm, I guess I still need to think about exactly what this is for.
Perhaps we could add a "oneshot" option to the function tracer, and
when set it will only trace a function once? Is there a strong reason
to add a new event type "oneshot_entry"? It may be useful to record the
parent of the function that triggered the first instance as well.

I'm still trying to get a grip around exactly what use cases this would
be good for. Especially when adding new functionality like this.
