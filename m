Right. The clocksource is determined at runtime. And if there is no high
resolution clocksource then that function will return crap.

Well, yes. But it's trivial enough to utilize parts of it for your
purposes.

Daniel could have replied, if you'd put him on Cc ....

Right, we can add a lot of things to the kernel which provide simple
generic mechanisms for special purposes and if all of them are enabled then
we are doing the same thing over and over.
