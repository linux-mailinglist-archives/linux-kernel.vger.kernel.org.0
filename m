What I was trying to do was something like:

oneOf:
     -minItems: 1
     -maxItems: 3
     -items:
       -const: a
       -const: b
       -const: c
     -items:
       -const: x
       -const: y
       -const: z

Where you have to have either [x, y, z] xor a set from [a, b, c].  One 
of the two items lists, where min/max is applied to the first one.  "-" 
on both of the items is needed since you can't seem to have the same tag 
more than one at the same scope level.

Probably this was a flawed idea from the start.

Yes, that looks completely different than what I read.  Thanks for the 
direct link.  I'm going to go read it.

Yes please.  Or atleast a "Hey, there are actually two specs, 'core' and 
'validation'. The 'validation' one is the relevant one.  Hopefully that 
clarifies any confusion"

You are right, order does matter in DT.  I think I've gotten used to 
just having -names, and assuming if a, b, c, and d are all listed as 
optional, that means you could have a and c.  However that kind of 
breaks the index mapping, so if you have c, you really need a and b as 
well.  I was attempting to apply that concept to schema, and it wasn't 
working.  I suspect that concept shouldn't be valid normally.

Ok, so I feel like I've misunderstood this except from writing-schema.md:

"The Devicetree schemas don't exactly match the YAML encoded DT data 
produced by dtc. They are simplified to make them more compact and avoid 
a bunch of boilerplate."

I thought this meant the bindings were simplified to be more readable, 
by skipping boilerplate text.  What does it actually mean?
