Not exactly in my opinion ;) The deleted text was not the problem. I
just deleted it because with the added text it turns to be redundant.

The issue that I found with the documentation (maybe just to my
newbie's eyes) is in this part:

"The trace buffers are allocated in pages (blocks of memory that the
kernel uses for allocation, usually 4 KB in size). If the last page
allocated has room for more bytes than requested, the rest of the
page will be used, making the actual allocation bigger than requested
or shown."

For me that "suggests" the interpretation that the number of pages
allocated in the current implementation correspond with the round
integer division of buffer_size_kb / PAGE_SIZE, which is inaccurate
(for 5 pages in the example that I mentioned).

Understood and agreed. It is funny that what I spotted as "a problem"
was precisely an incomplete description of the implementation (the
sentences that I quoted above). What do you think about removing
those two sentences?

You can count on it. I'm just starting to learn. I'm very grateful
that Joel took me under his wing ;) and with the time I hope to be
able to give back more to the community with the help of experts like
you Steve.

Thank you, Steve and Joel, for such quick feedback!
