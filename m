Thanks, didn't know git was assimilating formail functionality...

[reading git-mailsplit(1)]

The advantage of formail over git-mailsplit is that the former doesn't
create a bunch of files that need to be stored in a temporary place,
and cleant up afterwards.
But hey, that can be handled in yet-another-script...
