I understand that CCR would, in theory, allow to define that sort of
details. Still defining (and documenting) the default behavior would be
nice.

So the question is:
 * Can we rely set_rate() doing a root-to-leaf update until CCR comes
   around ?
 * If not, for use cases like the one described by Martin, I guess we
   are stuck with the notifier ? Or would you have something else to
   propose ?

It did but not anymore

I fixed that already :P
CLK_SET_RATE_GATE is a special case of clock protect. The clock is
protecting itself so it is going down through the tree.

Actually (ATM) the consumer is not even aware of it. If a clock with
CLK_SET_RATE_GATE is enabled, it will return the current rate to
.round_rate() and .set_rate() ... as if it was fixed.

ATM, yes ... if CCF cannot switch to another "unlocked" subtree (the
case here)

> Why can't the framework do this all in the clk_set_rate() call?

When there is multiple consumers the behavior would become a bit
difficult to predict and drivers may have troubles anticipating that,
maybe, the clock is locked.
