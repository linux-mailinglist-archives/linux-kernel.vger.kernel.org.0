Subject: [PATCH 2/3] sched/fair: Prevent active LB from preempting higher sched classes

The CFS load balancer can cause the cpu_stopper to run a function to
try and steal a rq's currently running task. However, it so happens
that while only CFS tasks will ever be migrated by that function, we
can end up preempting higher sched class tasks, since it is executed
by the cpu_stopper.

I don't expect this to be exceedingly common: we still need to have
had a busiest group in the first place, which needs

  busiest->sum_nr_running != 0

which is a cfs.h_nr_running sum, so we should have something to pull,
but if we fail to pull anything and the remote rq is executing
an RT/DL task we can hit this.

Add an extra check to not trigger the cpu_stopper if the remote
rq's running task isn't CFS.
