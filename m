So the concern is that we'd have extra call/ret activity in the stack?
That seems like a lot of hand-wringing over very little, but ok if so.

memcpy from what? For many of these xattrs, we need to format integer
data into strings. I could roll my own routine to do this formatting,
but that's sort of what sprintf and its variants are for and I'd rather
not reimplement all of it from scratch.

Sorry, if I'm being dense but I'm not sure I follow here.

Are you suggesting I should just copy/paste most of vsnprintf into a new
function that just leaves off the termination at the end, and leave the
original alone? That seems like a bit of a waste, but if that's the
consensus then ok.
