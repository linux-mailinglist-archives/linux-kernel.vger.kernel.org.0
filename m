The thing is we simply shouldn't introduce such the primitives since the thread
may migrate to another cpu, while you own the lock. This looks like a buggy design.

Have you tried temporary enabling interrupts in the middle of cycle after a huge enough
memory block is initialized? Something like:

deferred_init_memmap()
{
	while (spfn < epfn) {
		nr_pages += deferred_init_maxorder(&i, zone, &spfn, &epfn);
		local_irq_enable();
		local_irq_disable();
	}
}

Or, maybe, enable/disable interrupts somewhere inside deferred_init_maxorder().
