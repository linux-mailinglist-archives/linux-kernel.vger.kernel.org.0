This is the original approach which led to all sorts of problems and so
we switched the opt-out to opt-in. Have a look at a9bb7e620efd ("memcg:
only account kmem allocations marked as __GFP_ACCOUNT").
Our protection will never be perfect because that would require to
design the system with the protection in mind.

My memory is dim but AFAIR the memcg accounting was compromise between
usability and the whole system stability. Really large tables could be
allocated by untrusted users and that was seen as a _real_ problem. The
previous solution added _some_ protection which led to regressions
even for reasonable cases though. Memcg accounting was deemed as
reasonable middle ground.

The result is that a completely depleted memcg requires an admin
intervention and the admin has to know what to do to tear it down.
Kernel cannot do anything about that. And that is the trickiness I've
had in mind. Listing page tables is something admins can do quite
easily, right? There are many other objects which are much harder to act
about. E.g. what are you going to do with tmpfs mounts? Are you going to
remove them and cause potential data loss? That being said some objects
really have to be limited even before they start consuming memory IMHO.
