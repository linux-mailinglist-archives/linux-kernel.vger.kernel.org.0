How about this:

 A problem was found where identical configuration of planes leads
 to different register settings at the HW layer when using a X server
 with modesetting driver and one plane marked as a cursor.
  
 On first run of the X server, only the black screen and the layer
 containing the cursor is visible. Switching to console and back
 corrects the situation.
 
 I have dumped registers, and found out this:

 (In both cases there are two enabled planes, plane 1 with zpos 0 and
 plane 3 with zpos 1).
 
 1) First Xorg run:
 
   0x01101000 : 00000201
   0x01101080 : 00000030
 
   BLD_FILL_COLOR_CTL: (aka SUN8I_MIXER_BLEND_PIPE_CTL)
     P1_EN
 
   BLD_CH_RTCTL: (aka SUN8I_MIXER_BLEND_ROUTE)
     P0_RTCTL channel0
     P1_RTCTL channel3
 
 2) After switch to console and back to Xorg:
 
 0x01101000 : 00000301
 0x01101080 : 00000031
 
   BLD_FILL_COLOR_CTL:
     P1_EN and P0_EN
 
   BLD_CH_RTCTL:
     P0_RTCTL channel1
     P1_RTCTL channel3
 
 What happens is that sun8i_ui_layer_enable() function may disable
 blending pipes even if it is no longer assigned to its layer, because
 of incorrect state/zpos tracking in the driver.
 
 In particular, layer 1 is configured to zpos 0 and thus uses pipe 0.
 When layer 3 is enabled by X server, sun8i_ui_layer_enable() will get
 called with old_zpos=0 zpos=1, which will lead to disabling of pipe 0.
 
 In general this issue can happen to any layer during enable or zpos
 changes on multiple layers at once.
 
 To correct this we now pass previous enabled/disabled state of the
 layer, and pass real previous zpos of the layer to
 sun8i_ui_layer_enable() and rework the sun8i_ui_layer_enable() function
 to react to the state changes correctly. In order to not complicate
 the atomic_disable callback with all of the above changes, we simply
 remove it and implement all the chanes as part of atomic_update, which
 also reduces the code duplication.
 
 To make this all work, initial zpos positions of all layers need to be
 restored to initial values on reset.
