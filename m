This problem is still valid and not addressed by Vanya's patch (and
should not be as it is a disjoint issue).  However, calling
devm_ioremap() is somewhat racy as the NVS driver is not aware of that.

My take is that this should be fixed in the code that assigns regions to
the NVS driver e.g. it could look up the regions assigned to the
MSFT0101 and ignore those regions. In the end linux-acpi maintainers
have the say on this but this would be the angle that I'd take to
implement such patch probably.
