I think we can cast it and have a comment. This way the structure can be
placed in the RO section of memory.

It avoids one indirection to figure out something and makes the code
clearer. prv_data doesn't have any use for config otherwise.

Who is updating the accumulated time? This debugfs code? Or the
subsystems themselves?

Thanks, I understand the motivation.

Yes I'm missing subsystem restart. A comment would certainly help. If
this is the case, maybe this should be libified and each subsystem
driver should call some add/remove function in here so that we can
refetch the smem pointer. Doing the lookup each time isn't great.

What is the failure? Do you need to read 4 bytes at a time? On arm64
memcpy_fromio() looks to do byte size reads if the size isn't 8 bytes.
Maybe just use __raw_readl() then if it is only 4 bytes and you need a
word accessor.
