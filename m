Ok. So long as each of the contexts are migrated before the IRQ is, I
think that's sound. Otherwise there's a small window where the IRQ
handler for an instance won't see the state expected (and could end up
treated as a screaming IRQ).

Otherwise, in that case I think that's not so bad.

Whoops; I'd misread thhe DMC-620 code above assuming it was the SMMUv3
PMU.

Thanks,
