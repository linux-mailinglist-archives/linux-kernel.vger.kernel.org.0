- Add more information about listRCU patterns taking examples
from audit subsystem in the linux kernel.

- The initially written audit examples are kept, even though they are
slightly different in the kernel.

- Modify inline text for better passage quality.

- Fix typo in code-blocks and improve code comments.

- Add text formatting (italics, bold and code) for better emphasis.

v2:
- Balance out plain-text reading and Sphinx generated HTML.
- Remove code blocks from functions included in kerneldoc
  and other functions that currently don't have a kerneldoc
  entry, but may have one in the future.
- Leave in code blocks for:
	- CONSTANTS
	- variables
	- functions used as an example for explaining
		(audit_upd_rule(), timerfd_setup_cancel() etc)
	- macros (since they don't have a kerneldoc entry)
		(read_lock(), write_lock())

 =============================================
 
 One of the best applications of RCU is to protect read-mostly linked lists
-("struct list_head" in list.h).  One big advantage of this approach
+(``struct list_head`` in list.h).  One big advantage of this approach
 is that all of the required memory barriers are included for you in
 the list macros.  This document describes several applications of RCU,
 with the best fits first.
 
-Example 1: Read-Side Action Taken Outside of Lock, No In-Place Updates
+
+Example 1: Read-mostly list: Deferred Destruction
+-------------------------------------------------
+
+A widely used usecase for RCU lists in the kernel is lockless iteration over
+all processes in the system. ``task_struct::tasks`` represents the list node that
+links all the processes. The list can be traversed in parallel to any list
+additions or removals.
+
+The traversal of the list is done using ``for_each_process()`` which is defined
+by the 2 macros::
+
+	#define next_task(p) \
+		list_entry_rcu((p)->tasks.next, struct task_struct, tasks)
+
+	#define for_each_process(p) \
+		for (p = &init_task ; (p = next_task(p)) != &init_task ; )
+
+The code traversing the list of all processes typically looks like::
+
+	rcu_read_lock();
+	for_each_process(p) {
+		/* Do something with p */
+	}
+	rcu_read_unlock();
+
+The simplified code for removing a process from a task list is::
+
+	void release_task(struct task_struct *p)
+	{
+		write_lock(&tasklist_lock);
+		list_del_rcu(&p->tasks);
+		write_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
+		call_rcu(&p->rcu, delayed_put_task_struct);
+	}
+
+When a process exits, ``release_task()`` calls ``list_del_rcu(&p->tasks)`` under
+``tasklist_lock`` writer lock protection, to remove the task from the list of
+all tasks. The ``tasklist_lock`` prevents concurrent list additions/removals
+from corrupting the list. Readers using ``for_each_process()`` are not protected
+with the ``tasklist_lock``. To prevent readers from noticing changes in the list
+pointers, the ``task_struct`` object is freed only after one or more grace
+periods elapse (with the help of call_rcu()). This deferring of destruction
+ensures that any readers traversing the list will see valid ``p->tasks.next``
+pointers and deletion/freeing can happen in parallel with traversal of the list.
+This pattern is also called an **existence lock**, since RCU pins the object in
+memory until all existing readers finish.

+through a hashtable using an RCU-managed hlist for the hash chains. When a new
+limit is set, a new limit object is allocated and ``ct_limit_set()`` is called
+to replace the old limit object with the new one using list_replace_rcu().

+Example 5: Skipping Stale Objects
+---------------------------------
+
+For some usecases, reader performance can be improved by skipping stale objects
+during read-side list traversal if the object in concern is pending destruction
+after one or more grace periods. One such example can be found in the timerfd
+subsystem. When a ``CLOCK_REALTIME`` clock is reprogrammed - for example due to
+setting of the system time, then all programmed timerfds that depend on this
+clock get triggered and processes waiting on them to expire are woken up in
+advance of their scheduled expiry. To facilitate this, all such timers are added
+to an RCU-managed ``cancel_list`` when they are setup in
+``timerfd_setup_cancel()``::
+
+	static void timerfd_setup_cancel(struct timerfd_ctx *ctx, int flags)
+	{
+		spin_lock(&ctx->cancel_lock);
+		if ((ctx->clockid == CLOCK_REALTIME &&
+		    (flags & TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME) && (flags & TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET)) {
+			if (!ctx->might_cancel) {
+				ctx->might_cancel = true;
+				spin_lock(&cancel_lock);
+				list_add_rcu(&ctx->clist, &cancel_list);
+				spin_unlock(&cancel_lock);
+			}
+		}
+		spin_unlock(&ctx->cancel_lock);
+	}
+
+When a timerfd is freed (fd is closed), then the ``might_cancel`` flag of the
+timerfd object is cleared, the object removed from the ``cancel_list`` and
+destroyed::
+
+	int timerfd_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
+	{
+		struct timerfd_ctx *ctx = file->private_data;
+
+		spin_lock(&ctx->cancel_lock);
+		if (ctx->might_cancel) {
+			ctx->might_cancel = false;
+			spin_lock(&cancel_lock);
+			list_del_rcu(&ctx->clist);
+			spin_unlock(&cancel_lock);
+		}
+		spin_unlock(&ctx->cancel_lock);
+
+		hrtimer_cancel(&ctx->t.tmr);
+		kfree_rcu(ctx, rcu);
+		return 0;
+	}
+
+If the ``CLOCK_REALTIME`` clock is set, for example by a time server, the
+hrtimer framework calls ``timerfd_clock_was_set()`` which walks the
+``cancel_list`` and wakes up processes waiting on the timerfd. While iterating
+the ``cancel_list``, the ``might_cancel`` flag is consulted to skip stale
+objects::
+
+	void timerfd_clock_was_set(void)
+	{
+		struct timerfd_ctx *ctx;
+		unsigned long flags;
+
+		rcu_read_lock();
+		list_for_each_entry_rcu(ctx, &cancel_list, clist) {
+			if (!ctx->might_cancel)
+				continue;
+			spin_lock_irqsave(&ctx->wqh.lock, flags);
+			if (ctx->moffs != ktime_mono_to_real(0)) {
+				ctx->moffs = KTIME_MAX;
+				ctx->ticks++;
+				wake_up_locked_poll(&ctx->wqh, EPOLLIN);
+			}
+			spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ctx->wqh.lock, flags);
+		}
+		rcu_read_unlock();
+	}

+The key point here is, because RCU-traversal of the ``cancel_list`` happens

 	If the search function drops the per-entry lock before returning,
