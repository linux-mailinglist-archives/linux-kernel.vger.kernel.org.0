Implementing one callback or the other really depends on how the HW
behaves. The irq framework gives you a wide range of flows that allow
you to plug your driver in the stack, but the prerequisite is that you
know *exactly* how the HW behaves. Ack and EOI have very different
meanings, are called from different flows, and correspond to different
states in the interrupt life cycle.

Use the wrong one, and you will lose interrupts. If you don't know how
the HW behaves, then the chances of something bad happening are pretty
high (you'll end-up in deadlock land at some point). I'm afraid I 
cannot
help you with that, short of being given access to some documentation
that doesn't seem to exist.
