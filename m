The priority is raised if kswapd_shrink_node() returns false for kswapd 
(The direct reclaim would just raise the priority if sc->nr_reclaimed >= 
sc->nr_to_reclaim). The kswapd_shrink_node() returns "return 
sc->nr_scanned >= sc->nr_to_reclaim". So, the old "double pressure" 
doesn't work as it was designed anymore since it would prevent from make 
"sc->nr_scanned < sc->nr_to_reclaim".

And, the patch 2/2 would not make the priority go up too much since one 
THP would be accounted as 512 base page.
