That is okay for me, the thing that is bit confusing is having a probe
etc and no match.. (more below)..

Well the world is not PCI/ACPI... We have controllers which are DT
described and work in same manner as a PCI device.

The "big" difference is that probe is called by core (asoc) and not by
driver onto themselves.. IMO that needs to go away.

And if you look closely all this work is done by core not by drivers!
Drivers _should_ never do all this, it is the job of core to do that for
you.
