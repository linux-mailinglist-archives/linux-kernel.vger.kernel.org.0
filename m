You change the subject from irq mode vs polled mode device to some
other type of device:

I again try to get you to discuss the irq mode vs polled mode device:

And the thread is so deeply nested that you are missing the original
point that I made.

If the device _must_ operate in irq mode to achieve the throughput
that is _required_ for the system to be functional then that system
would need a devicetree to have a "depends-on" property for the irq.
But another system using the same exact hardware might be able to
tolerate the reduced throughput of operating in polled mode.  This
second system would need a devicetree that does _not_ have a
depends-on property for that same irq, as used by that same device.

This then becomes configuration, not hardware description, as noted
in my next paragraph:
