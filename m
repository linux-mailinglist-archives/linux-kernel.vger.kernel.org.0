This breaks the normal pattern of how '#.*-cells' works. While Arnd 
suggests removing it, I don't think that works well either with having a 
generic 'syscons' property. That means every syscon in a system has to 
have the same number of cells.

I don't really want to see syscon binding expanded. Really, I'd like 
'syscon' to go away. It's nothing more than a flag to create a regmap.

I think it is better to keep the property names specific to exactly what 
the functionality is for each syscon phandle rather than a generic 
binding.

What are the eamples of where you want to use this? Keep in mind that 
this sort of connection should *only* be used for things that have no 
other binding and kernel subsystem.
