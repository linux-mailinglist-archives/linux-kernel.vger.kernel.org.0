I am not sure if syscon parent really matches hardware implementation. 
In all our Networking SoCs, chiptop is kind of misc register collection. 
Some registers can't belong to any particular group, or they need to 
work together with other modules(therefore, these misc registers would 
be accessed by two or more modules). However, chiptop is not a hardware 
module.

I will check with Dilip about how we should move forward. syscon parent
