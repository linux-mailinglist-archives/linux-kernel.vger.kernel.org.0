OK, I like this idea. As the current approach "silently" adds the boot
config, it may be surprising to someone that the configs are changing
(if they don't know to look for /proc/bootconfig).

Having a "config=bootconfig" required for reading makes it implicit
that a bootconfig is added to the existing command line, from just
looking at /proc/cmdline, and removing an added "config=bootconfig"

I have no problem with this approach. Masami, are you OK with this?

I'll send a v2 implementing this change shortly.
