This needs to be 4 separate patches since the change to each subsystem
will go through a different maintainer.

Also: it'll be a lot easier to land this if you make the new
rpmh_start_transaction() and rpmh_end_transaction() calls _optional_
for now, especially since they are just a speed optimization and not
for correctness.  That is, if a driver makes a call to rpmh_write(),
rpmh_write_async(), rpmh_write_batch(), or rpmh_invalidate() without
doing rpmh_start_transaction() then it should still work--just flush
right away.  Since you have rpmh_start_transaction() refcounted that's
as simple as making a call to rpmh_start_transaction() at the
beginning of all public calls and rpmh_end_transaction() at the end.
If there was already a refcount then no harm done.  If there wasn't
you'll get a flush at the end.

Once you make the call optional, you can actually leave changing the
callers until after your series lands.  Then you don't end up
bothering all the other maintainers with the back-and-forth.

Once all callers are updated you can make the call required.  ...or
(as noted below) maybe we should just keep it optional...

One last note here: you have a regulator change here but aren't
sending it to the regulator maintainer.  That won't work.  You also
have an interconnect change without sending it to the interconnect
maintainer.

You can't do this.  "ret" is an integer and you're munging two error
codes into one int.  I don't think there is any clever way to do this,
but probably this would be fine (the compiler should optimize):

if (ret)
  rpmh_end_transaction(c->dev);
else
  ret = rpmh_end_transaction(c->dev);

...or just leave the "dev_err" and "return ret" where they were and
call rpmh_end_transaction() above without looking at the return value.

Technically the error message above is now misleading if the
"end_transaction" failed.  Namely it will blame things on the active
only state whereas that wasn't the problem.

Again, no |=

Also: one argument for keeping start_transaction and end_transaction
optional long term is that you could completely eliminate this change.

Personally I don't think "out" and "end" are very descriptive.  My own
favorite is to name these types of labels based on what has been done
so far.  So:

exit_started_rpmh_transaction:
exit_constructed_list:
