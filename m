Yes, agreed.

The third case is, for example, three devices A, B, C in a group. The
first device A is neutral about which type of default domain type is
used. So the iommu framework will use a static default domain. But the
device B requires to use a specific one which is different from the
default. Currently, this is handled in the vendor iommu driver and one
motivation of this patch set is to handle this in the generic layer.
