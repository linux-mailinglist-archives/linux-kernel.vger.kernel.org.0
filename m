So the scenario is DT describes the clk

 dpu_node {
     clocks =3D <&cc AHB_CLK>;
     clock-names =3D "iface";
 }

but the &cc node has a driver that doesn't probe?

I believe in this scenario we return -EPROBE_DEFER because we assume we
should wait for the clk driver to probe and provide the iface clk. See
of_clk_get_hw_from_clkspec() and how it looks through a list of clk
providers and tries to match the &cc phandle to some provider.

Once the driver probes, the match will happen and we'll be able to look
up the clk in the provider with __of_clk_get_hw_from_provider(). If
the clk provider decides that there isn't a clk object, it will return
NULL and then eventually clk_hw_create_clk() will turn the NULL return
value into a NULL pointer to return from clk_get().
