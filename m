I'm glad these systems are well designed, but that's not what SBSA 
mandates.

All it requires is that the all PEs are part of the same IS domain, and
that PCIe is part of the same IS domain as the PEs. Nothing more, and
certainly nothing about the GIC. Or anything else.

Linux works just fine as long as all the PEs are in the same IS domain.
There is no architectural requirement for anything else to be in that
domain.

It really looks odd that L3 would even contain non-shareable entries.

Anyway, I don't think that's a biggy. Given that GICv4 is almost
exclusively implemented on these two SoCs (unless someone revives
QC system), I think we can take this change after some testing.

Thanks,
