This is already happening because if the target node is short on memory
it will start to reclaim and if MADV_FREE pages are at the tail of
inactive file LRU list then they will be dropped. Please note how that
follows proper aging and doesn't introduce any special casing. Really
MADV_FREE is an inactive cache for anonymous memory and we treat it like
inactive page cache. This is not carved in stone of course but it really
requires very good justification to change.
