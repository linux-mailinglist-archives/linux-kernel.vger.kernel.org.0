I had wondered about perf events but I'm not sure that's any more suitable.

I mean in order to minimize IPI traffic something like: sample/calculate
all of a CPU's purr, idle_purr, spurr, idle_spurr in a single IPI upon a
read of any of the attributes, and cache the result for some time, so
that the anticipated subsequent reads of the other attributes use the
cached results instead of generating more IPIs.

That would keep the current sysfs interface at the cost of imposing a
certain coarseness in the results.

Anyway, that's a mitigation that could be considered if the
implementation in this patch is found to be too expensive in practice.
