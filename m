I saw there are internal functions which have code comments, e.g
shrink_slab() in mm/vmscan.c, not only this one place, there are several
places. I personally prefer to see code comment for function if
possible, this can save time, e.g people can skip the bitmap operation
when read code if not necessary. And here I mainly want to tell there
are different returned value to note different behaviour when call them.

Anyway, it's fine to me to remove them. The two functions are internal,
and not so complicated. I will remove them since you both object.
However, I disagree with the saying that we should not add code comment
for internal function.

Thanks
