well yes :)  though rather verbose.   There is still a minute window as 
we're comparing values in sysfs, prior to opening the device, so 
technically something could change in that window between when we 
checked sysfs and when we open'd.   We can certain check after we open 
the device to solve that issue.

There is some elegance to a 32-bit token for the controller (can be an 
incrementing value) passed in the event and used when servicing the 
event that avoids a bunch of work.

Doing either of these would eliminate what Hannes liked - looking for 
the discovery controller with those attributes. Although, I don't know 
that looking for it is all that meaningful.
