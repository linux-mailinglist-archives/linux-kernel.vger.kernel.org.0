Yes, I agree.

But I'm afraid I can't follow this point. After reading the code (with
Qemu) a bit further, the Redistributors are restored before the ITS. So
there should be _no_ LPI has been mapped when we're restoring GICR_CTLR
and enabling LPI, which says we will not scan the whole pending table
and restore pending by vgic_enable_lpis()/its_sync_lpi_pending_table(),
regardless of what the PTZ is.

Instead, vgic_its_restore_ite()/vgic_v3_lpi_sync_pending_status() is
where we actually read the guest RAM and restore the LPI pending state.
Which means we will still do the right thing even for non-Linux guests.
Not sure if I've got things correctly here.

In the end, let's keep the patch as it is.

If so, just by luck ;-)
