That's all kernel drivers are, vendor-specific quirks/hacks around
broken hardware :)

Splitting this out into logical fixes, like some of these are here, is
great.  But breaking non-qualcomm hardware like this patch would do, is
obviously not ok.

They have to be upstreamable, you don't want these in random vendor
trees as they go no where and atrophy and break users.  We want them in
our main tree for everyone to use for the obvious reason that they are
needed to get real hardware working.
