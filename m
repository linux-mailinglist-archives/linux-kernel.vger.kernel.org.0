do you plan on submitting these soonish? Because looking at your
termination-gpio change makes me want to do something similar for
my RE-gpio ... instead of trying to mangle this into the DTR thingy.

yep and on our board we have DE and RE on separate gpios, so I guess
it makes sense to use that pin how it was intended ;-) .

So I guess having that as rs485-re-gpios property might be the best way.
