Hi Masami,

After receiving this email, I replied to one email on the v1 thread,
so there will be a little bit of overlap in the ordering of the two
threads.  Feel free to reply to my comments in the v1 thread in this
thread instead.

Thanks for writing up some of what we discussed.

Let me add a problem statement and use case.  I'll probably get it at least
a little bit wrong, so please update as needed.

(1) You feel the ftrace kernel command line syntax is not sufficiently user
    friendly.

(2) The kernel command line is too small to contain the full set of desired
    ftrace commands and options.

(3) There is a desire to change the boot time ftrace commands and options
    without re-compiling or re-linking the Linux kernel.

Devicetree is not a universal data structure and communication channel.

Devicetree is a description of the hardware and also conveys bootloader
specific information that is need by the kernel to boot.

Base64 being one of possibly many ways to convert arbitrary binary data to
ascii safe data _if_ you want to transfer the ftrace options and commands
in a binary format.

Similar to the way initrd is handled, if I understand correctly.  (I am not
up to date on how initrd location is passed to the kernel for a non-devicetree
kernel.)

Compressed or not compressed would be an ftrace design choice.

Compressed or not compressed would be an ftrace design choice.

For the three options above:

Binary data if ftrace prefers structured data.
A list of strings if ftrace wants to use the existing kernel command line
syntax.

For the third of the above three options, the linker would provide the start
and end address of the ftrace options and commands section.

Not a "magic" command.  Either continue using the existing ftrace syntax or
add something like: ftrace_cmd="whatever format ftrace desires".

Why can the maximum size of the cmdline not be increased?

Hand typing a kernel command line is already not a fun exercise, even
before adding ftrace commands.  If you are hand typing kernel command
lines then I suggest you improve your tools (eg bootloader or whatever
is not allowing you to edit and store command lines).

I got lost in the next sentence, so for my benefit:
GSKBA == generic structured kernel boot arguments

Or if in a kernel data section then the linker can provide the begin and
end address of the blob.  This is already implemented for some other data
structures.

Why would the boot loader need to access the elf header?  The linker
can provide the location of the new kernel data section via kernel
variables.

This is still mis-use of the devicetree data structure.  This data
does not belong in the devicetree.
