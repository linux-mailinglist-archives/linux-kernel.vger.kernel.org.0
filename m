I have checked the history and the dependency is there since NUMA was
introduced in arm64. So it would be great to double check with arch
maintainers.

Sure the resulting code logic makes sense. I meant that it doesn't make
much sense wrt readability. There is a loop over all existing numa nodes
to have ifdef for NUMA inside the loop. See?

The loop is ok. Maybe we have other memblock API that would be better
but I am not really aware of it from top of my head. I would stick with
it. It just sucks that this API depends on HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP and
that it is not generally available. This is what I am complaining about.
Just look what kind of dirty hack it made you to create ;)

This is not the first time HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP has been problematic.
I might be missing something but I really do not get why do we really
need it these days. As for !NUMA, I suspect we can make it generate the
right thing when !NUMA.
