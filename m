Both DT and PCI would use a DIFFERENT matching on the parent bus, not a 
matching provided by the SoundWire subsystem itself.

What I did is not different from what existed already with platform 
devices. They were manually created, weren't they?

Please look at the code again, you have a USB probe that will manually 
call the GreyBus device creation.

static int ap_probe(struct usb_interface *interface,
		    const struct usb_device_id *id)
{
	hd = gb_hd_create(&es2_driver, &udev->dev, 	


static struct usb_driver es2_ap_driver = {
	.name =		"es2_ap_driver",
	.probe =	ap_probe, <<< code above
	.disconnect =	ap_disconnect,
	.id_table =	id_table,
	.soft_unbind =	1,
};

The master device probe suggested here is also called as part of the 
parent SOF PCI device probe, same as this USB example. I really don't 
see what your objection is, given that there is no way to deal with the 
SoundWire controller as a independent entity for Intel platforms.
