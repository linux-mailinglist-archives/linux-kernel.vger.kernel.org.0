Well, that's what the existing walker code does if you don't have that
"pud_entry()" callback.

That said, I assume you would *not* want to do that if the huge
pud/pmd is already clean and read-only, but just continue.

So you may want to have a special pud_entry() that handles that case.
Eventually. Maybe. Although honestly, if you're doing dirty tracking,
I doubt it makes much sense to use largepages.

zap_pud_range()actually does have that

               VM_BUG_ON_VMA(!rwsem_is_locked(&tlb->mm->mmap_sem), vma);

exactly for the case where it might have to split the pud entry.

Zapping the whole thing it does do without the assert.

I'm not going to swear the mmap_sem is absolutely required, since a
shared vma should be stable due to the i_mmap_lock, but splitting the
hugepage really is a fairly big deal.

It can't happen if you zap the *whole* mapping, but it can happen if
you have a start/end range. Like you do.

Also, in general it's probably not a great idea to look at
zap_page_range() (and copy_page_range()) for ideas.

They are kind of special, since they tend to be used for fundamental
whole-address-space operations (ie fork/exit) and so as a result they
get to do special things that a normal page walker generally shouldn't
do.

It's why they've never gotten translated to use the generic walker code.
