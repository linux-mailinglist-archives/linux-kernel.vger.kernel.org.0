Agreed. Also, we are already telling people what the right include path
is in at least two ways - and currently they are incompatible:

- The pkg-config file included with libbpf has a notion of include path;
  which does *not* include the bpf/ subdirectory.

- The skeleton generator puts an '#include <libbpf.h>' line into the
  generated files.

With this series we'll at least be consistent.

Yeah, I think being clear and explicit about what is the recommended way
to include libbpf is strictly an improvement. And making it possible to
move example programs seamlessly in and out of the kernel tree will only
make things easier for people.

I'll rebase and respin this series on top of the revert (and fix
Andrii's comments).
