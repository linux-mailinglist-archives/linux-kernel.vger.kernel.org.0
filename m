Subject: Re: [PATCH v3] mm: hugetlb: optionally allocate gigantic hugepages
 using cma 65;5803;1c Commit 944d9fec8d7a
 ("hugetlb: add support for gigantic page allocation at runtime") has added
 the run-time allocation of gigantic pages. However it actually works only
 at early stages of the system loading, when the majority of memory is free.
 After some time the memory gets fragmented by non-movable pages, so the
 chances to find a contiguous 1 GB block are getting close to zero. Even
 dropping caches manually doesn't help a lot.

Lots of review input on v2, but then everyone went quiet ;)

Has everything been addressed?
