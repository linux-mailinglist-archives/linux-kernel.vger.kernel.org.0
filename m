Added.

I also added a Sphinx extension to handle it as well. You'll notice that it
is almost a copy of kernel_abi.py. 

With regards to patch 2/2, it will generate both a feature x arch matrix 
at the admin-guide and a x86-specific features list.

IMO, it makes sense to have a per-arch feature file just like the one
I added to x86. As the patches converting documentation for other archs
are still being merged via docs tree, before adding the features list to
the other arch documents, it seems better to wait to do it after the
next merge window.

Those patches are applied after the ABI patches on this dir:

	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/log/?h=abi_patches_v4.1

The output with both scripts are at:

	https://www.infradead.org/~mchehab/rst_features/index.html

The relevant parts are: ABI:

	https://www.infradead.org/~mchehab/rst_features/admin-guide/abi.html

Feature list x architecture (at admin-guide:

	https://www.infradead.org/~mchehab/rst_features/admin-guide/features.html

X86 features:

	https://www.infradead.org/~mchehab/rst_features/x86/features.html

While I didn't write a patch, with the new get_feat.pl script, we can probably
get rid of the previous shell script at:

	Documentation/features/list-arch.sh

As calling:

	./scripts/get_feat.pl current

Will output the same content (with a different format, though).

Thanks,
Mauro
