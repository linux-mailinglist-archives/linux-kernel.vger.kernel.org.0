I like the idea, but yeah tend to agree the current approach might not be
enough.

I think the major problem here is that on generic systems where CFS is a first
class citizen, RT tasks can be hostile to them - not always necessarily for a
good reason.

To further complicate the matter, even among CFS tasks we can't tell which are
more important than the others - though hopefully latency-nice proposal will
make the situation better.

So I agree we have a problem here, but I think this patch is just a temporary
band aid and we need to do better. Though I have no concrete suggestion yet on
how to do that.

Another thing I couldn't quantify yet how common and how severe this problem is
yet. Jing-Ting, if you can share the details of your use case that'd be great.

Cheers
