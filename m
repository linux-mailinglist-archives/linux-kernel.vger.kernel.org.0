Andrey talked to me a little about this today. Andrey would prefer we
don't just let the TPM go into a wonky state if it's used during
suspend/resume so that it can stay resilient to errors. Sounds OK to me,
but my point still stands that we need to fix the callers.

I'll resurrect the IS_SUSPENDED flag and make it set generically by the
tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_pm_resume() functions and then spit out a big
WARN_ON() and return an error value like -EAGAIN if the TPM functions
are called when the TPM is suspended. I hope we don't hit the warning
message, but if we do then at least we can track it down rather quickly
and figure out how to fix the caller instead of just silently returning
-EAGAIN and hoping for that to be visible to the user.

This patch will still be required to avoid the WARN message, so I'll
resend with the Cc to crypto list so it can be picked up.
