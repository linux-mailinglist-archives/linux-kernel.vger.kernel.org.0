Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] locking/lockdep: Reuse zapped chain_hlocks entries
Date:   Wed, 15 Jan 2020 16:43:05 -0500
Message-Id: <20200115214313.13253-1-longman@redhat.com>

 v3:
  - Move the bug fix patches to the beginning of the series.
  - Include a number of changes as suggested by PeterZ.
  - Increase MAX_CHAIN_BUCKETS from 8 to 10 to reduce the chance of using
    the unsized list.
  - Add patch 7 to add a lockdep_early_init() call.
  - Add patch 8 to allocate chain hlocks by splitting large chain block
    as a last resort.

 v2:
  - Revamp the chain_hlocks reuse patch to store the freed chain_hlocks
    information in the chain_hlocks entries themselves avoiding the
    need of a separate set of tracking structures. This, however,
    requires a minimum allocation size of at least 2. Thanks to PeterZ
    for his review and inspiring this change.
  - Remove the leakage counter as it is no longer applicable.
  - Add patch 6 to make the output of /proc/lockdep_chains more readable.

It was found that when running a workload that kept on adding lock
classes and then zapping them repetitively, the system will eventually
run out of chain_hlocks[] entries even though there were still plenty
of other lockdep data buffers available.

  [ 4318.443670] BUG: MAX_LOCKDEP_CHAIN_HLOCKS too low!
  [ 4318.444809] turning off the locking correctness validator.

In order to fix this problem, we have to make chain_hlocks[] entries
reusable just like other lockdep arrays. Besides that, the patchset
also adds some zapped class and chain_hlocks counters to be tracked by
/proc/lockdep_stats. It also fixes leakage in the irq context counters
and makes the output of /proc/lockdep_chains more readable.

Waiman Long (8):
  locking/lockdep: Decrement irq context counters when removing lock
    chain
  locking/lockdep: Display irq_context names in /proc/lockdep_chains
  locking/lockdep: Track number of zapped classes
  locking/lockdep: Throw away all lock chains with zapped class
  locking/lockdep: Track number of zapped lock chains
  locking/lockdep: Reuse freed chain_hlocks entries
  locking/lockdep: Add lockdep_early_init() before any lock is taken
  locking/lockdep: Enable chain block splitting as last resort
