You're confused.  Because we have a shortage of bits in the page flags,
we use the same bit for both PageReadahead and PageReclaim.  That doesn't
mean that a page marked as PageReclaim should be treated as PageReadahead.

PageReclaim is always cleared before PageWriteback.  eg here:

void end_page_writeback(struct page *page)
...
        if (PageReclaim(page)) {
                ClearPageReclaim(page);
                rotate_reclaimable_page(page);
        }

        if (!test_clear_page_writeback(page))
                BUG();

so if PageWriteback is clear, PageReclaim must already be observable as clear.
