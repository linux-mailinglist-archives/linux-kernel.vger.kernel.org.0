We expect users to avoid making it too big, but we cannot rule it out.

Actually for the common perf stat for a long time case you can make it fairly
big because the percentages still work out over the complete run time.

The problem with letting it accumulate too much is mainly if you
want to use a continuously running metrics counter to time smaller
regions by taking deltas, for example using RDPMC. 

In this case the small regions would be too inaccurate after some time.

But to make the first case work absolutely need to handle the overflow
case. Otherwise the metrics would just randomly stop at some
point.
