Not at all.  That sort of thing occurs all the time; just look at a few 
commits in the kernel or patches on the mailing lists.  Especially ones 
that are bug fixes.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.  In any case, it would be 
completely wrong to think that usb_port_suspend isn't involved in 
runtime PM.

In fact, usb_port_suspend is _more_ important for runtime suspend than
for system sleep.  The reason is simple: If you want to put a USB
device into runtime suspend, you have to tell its upstream hub's port
to enable the suspend feature (i.e., call usb_port_suspend).  But if
you want to put an entire bus of USB devices to sleep for a system
suspend, all you have to do is tell the host controller to stop sending
packets; the ports don't need any notification.

(Actually the situation is more complicated for USB 3.  But you get the 
idea.)

No, the purpose of the sections you removed is to trigger port poweroff
when the device goes into any type of suspend, either system or
runtime.  Of course, as you discovered, during system sleep the code
doesn't actually turn off the port power -- that's a bug.  But during
runtime PM it does.

Okay, so long as they are static and won't conflict with the functions 
in hub.c.

Alan Stern

PS: There's one more thing you need to know -- I completely forgot 
about it until just now.  During system sleep, we have to make sure 
that the child device gets suspended _before_ and resumed _after_ the 
port.  If it happened the other way, we'd be in trouble.

(The proper ordering would be automatic if the child USB device was
registered under the port device, but for historical reasons it isn't;
it gets registered directly under the parent hub.)

This means you'll have to call device_pm_wait_for_dev() at the 
appropriate places in the suspend and resume pathways.
