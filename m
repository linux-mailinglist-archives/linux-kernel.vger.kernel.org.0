Does this look okay ?

mm/hotplug: Reorder memblock_[free|remove]() calls in try_remove_memory()

Currently during memory hot add procedure, memory gets into memblock before
calling arch_add_memory() which creates it's linear mapping.

add_memory_resource() {
        ..................
        memblock_add_node()
        ..................
        arch_add_memory()
        ..................
}

But during memory hot remove procedure, removal from memblock happens first
before it's linear mapping gets teared down with arch_remove_memory() which
is not coherent. Resource removal should happen in reverse order as they
were added.

try_remove_memory() {
        ..................
        memblock_free()
        memblock_remove()
        ..................
        arch_remove_memory()
        ..................
}

This changes the sequence of resource removal including memblock and linear
mapping tear down during memory hot remove which will now be the reverse
order in which they were added during memory hot add. The changed removal
order looks like the following.

try_remove_memory() {
        ..................
        arch_remove_memory()
        ..................
        memblock_free()
        memblock_remove()
        ..................
}
