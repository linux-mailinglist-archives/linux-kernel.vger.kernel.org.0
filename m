My original rewrite of this code did restrict the cases where
locks_delete_block() was called - but that didn't work.
See commit
  Commit 16306a61d3b7 ("fs/locks: always delete_block after waiting.")

There may be still be cases were we don't need to call
locks_delete_block(), but it is certainly safer - both now and after
possible future changes - to always call it.
If we can make it cheap to always call it - and I'm sure we can - then
that is the safest approach.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
