I can understand the fact that because there are no active users of this
return code, the current situation has been alright. But then I fail to
understand how can EBUSY be made ENOMEM and let the caller to think that
vmap_page_rage() failed because of lack of memory when it is clearly not
the case. It is really surprising how it can be acceptable inside kernel
(init_mm) page table functions which need to be thorough enough.
