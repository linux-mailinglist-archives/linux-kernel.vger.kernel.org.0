Correct, but there are also some cases that are only caught by
REFCOUNT_FULL.

My point was more general than that. If you want scalable concurrent code,
then you end up having to move away from the serialisation introduced by
locking. The main trick in the toolbox is cmpxchg() so, in the absence of
a zoo of special-purpose atomic instructions, it really needs to do better
than serialising.

I would like to see how it performs if we keep the checking inline, yes.
I suspect Ard could spin this in short order.

Maybe, but faced with the choice between your micro-benchmark results and
security-by-default for people using the arm64 Linux kernel, I really think
that's a no-brainer. I'm well aware that not everybody agrees with me on
that.
