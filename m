Sorry, but I'm not taking this.

I know you're trying to fix the issues I reported as quickly as you can (and
thank you for that), but I'm sure that you agree this needs more thought to
develop a proper solution to what is a much bigger issue than can be solved
by sprinkling #ifdefs. I can live with the warning on the basis that a
proper fix is in the pipeline, but in the meantime it can serve as a
reminder that we're not done here.

Will
