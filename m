But then what if cpu_up() fails? In this case I can think of only two
answers:

* Force the boot CPU as the housekeeper.
* Rollback the whole thing: nohz and all isolation.

The second solution looks sane to me. After all if the user doesn't
include CPU 0 in the housekeeping set, forcing it isn't going to
help much.

But that means we must enhance the isolation code (nohz included)
to be able to dynamically add/del CPUs to the houseeeping/isolation
set. That's not going to be easy but it's a necessary evolution
of that subsystem since we want to drive it through cpusets.

I should start working on that.
