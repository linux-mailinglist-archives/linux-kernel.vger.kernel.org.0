Right, so far we get that with task_fits_capacity().

Hmph thinking is hard but I think I agree with you.


Say you have

  rq.cpu_capacity_orig = 1024
  rq.util_avg = 300
  rq.uclamp.max = 600

  p.util_est = 600
  p.uclamp.max = 300

If we enqueue p on that rq, we shouldn't go above 600 util (or something
close, depending on the frequency this lets us select). But, AFAICT,
cpu_util_next() will see this as going to 900 util and we'll thus skip this
CPU for this task (because that would make us overutilized). With your
suggested change, we wouldn't skip this CPU. Plus this is what we end up
using in compute_energy(), so this would keep both ends aligned.


I think we have a similar problem for downmigration (with the current patch),
say you have:

  rq.cpu_capacity_orig = 462
  rq.util_avg = 50
  rq.uclamp.max = 100

  p.util_est = 512
  p.uclamp.max = 200

In this case I think we should get 200 cpu util, but we first do

  /* Skip CPUs that will be overutilized. */                                                         
  util = cpu_util_next(cpu, p, cpu);                                                                 
  cpu_cap = capacity_of(cpu);                                                                        
  if (!fits_capacity(util, cpu_cap))                                                                 
          continue;                    

which *doesn't* look at the clamps, so we would see ~562 util which doesn't
fit on that small CPU, so we'd skip it. With your approach we would correctly
clamp this to 200 and carry on.


One thing I'd like to point out is if we have tasks with default clamp values
(.min=0, .max=1024) enqueued, we won't "throttle" tasks with low uclamp.max.
So something to keep in mind.

One last thing: this makes CPU selection slightly different from what
wake_cap() will do (that latter only uses uclamp_task_util()), but I think
that is fine.
