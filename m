Yes, and yes. lparstat is part of powerpc-utils.

The 'physc' column represents cpu usage in units of physical cores.  
With 2 virtual cores ('lcpu=2') in uncapped, shared processor mode, we 
expect this to be closer to 2 when fully loaded (and spare capacity 
elsewhere in the system).

That's a fair point, and probably again points to this area getting less 
tested. One of the main reasons for this being caught now though, is 
that there are workloads being tested under lower SMT levels now. So, I 
suspect no one has been relying on this behavior and we can consider 
this to be a bug.
