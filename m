Right, which (as we discussed offline) is quite likely to happen if/when
we get stuff like SVE counters and we try to read them at boot time. Might
be worth adding a small note about that (0 != disabled).

Hmph, I'm a bit torn on that one. It would be really nice to provide *some*
amount of sanity checking at core level - e.g. by checking that at least
one of the four architected counters reads non-zero. But as you say these
could be disabled, while some other arch/aux counter is enabled, and we
could then mistakenly disable the feature. So we can't really do much
unless we handle *each* individual counter. Oh well :/

Right, the FIE support is actually a good example of that, I think.
