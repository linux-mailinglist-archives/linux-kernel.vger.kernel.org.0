Yes, that is better.

We could simply flush the workqueue in nvme_loop_delete_ctrl for
each controller?

Might be an overkill though, and its risking circular locking in case
we are going via the fatal error path (work context flushing a different 
workqueue always annoys lockdep even when its perfectly safe)

Then please fix tcp as well.
