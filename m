Ok, i will add as below:

# We need a select here so we don't match all nodes with 'simple-bus'
select:
   properties:
     compatible:
       contains:
         const: intel,combo-phy
   required:
     - compatible

Ok, I will remove this and use the 'aliases' to get the hardware instance.

No. Actually, this is specific to the combophy instance on the HSIO bus.
I see , this can be removed and value can be derived from the hardware 
instance value mentioned through 'aliases'

Sure, will update the code to use phys property and remove this entry,

2 children are required, as it is an example i just added one.
I will add the other child too.

Thanks for reviewing and giving the inputs.
