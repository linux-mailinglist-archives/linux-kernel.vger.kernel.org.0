But this is fine?

We only need to ensure that we have a full GP pass between the "last"
rcu_sync_exit() and GP_XXX -> GP_IDLE transition.

See above, it should not.

Again, I don't understand... GP_REPLAY ensures that we will have a full GP
before rcu_sync_func() sets GP_IDLE, note that it does another "recursive"
call_rcu() if it sees GP_REPLAY.

To ensure that if another CPU sees rcu_sync_is_idle() (GP_IDLE) after you
do rcu_sync_exit(), then it must also see all memory changes you did before
rcu_sync_exit().
