Hm, doing I3C transfers through sysfs sounds a bit odd. sysfs entries
are most of the time exposing human readable/writable stuff (plain text
data, that is).

Well, going for the spidev approach would solve that and make the
whole implementation more straightforward and less invasive (no
notifier, no need to expose internal device types to this i3cdev
driver, no concurrency issues, ...). We can always revisit this solution
if it proves to be to limited and we feel the need for a
kernel-driven i3cdev auto-binding logic, but I doubt we'll ever be
in that position since udev can handle that for us, and if we start
having actual userspace drivers (which is not the case yet), I expect
distros to add the relevant udev rules to take care of this auto-bind.
