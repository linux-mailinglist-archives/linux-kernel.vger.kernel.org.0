No, it's a no-op in this context and I meant to take the check out.

And that's what it is now. Functionally it's equivalent similar other
than imbalance could be potentially anything (but should be zero).

I couldn't convince myself to really push back hard on the sum_nr_runnable
versus idle_cpus.  If the local group has spare capacity and the busiest
group has multiple tasks stacked on CPUs then it's most likely due to
CPU affinity. In that case, there is no guarantee tasks can move to the
local group either. In that case, the difference between sum_nr_running
and idle_cpus is almost moot.  There may be common use cases where the
distinction really matters but right now, I'm at the point where I think
such a change could be a separate patch with the use case included and
supporting data on why it must be sum_nr_running.  Right now, I feel it's
mostly a cosmetic issue given the context and intent of the patch.
