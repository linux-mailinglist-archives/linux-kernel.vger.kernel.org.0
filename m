This I agree, but we are talking about my current situation.

This, I do not fully agree as bindings for the panel reset already
exist and we could have a reset on both: the bridge and the panel.
I choose to use a wrong (private) DT representation because I am not
willing to add an LVDS->RGB bridge: as you say, it is much more work to
do. But, IMHO, this is not related to the patch. If you consider this
patch wrong because a panel cannot have a reset, then it should be
stated clearly and maybe removed from the bindings?

Anyway if you think this change can't be useful, let's put it aside.

Thanks for your time,
Miqu√®l
