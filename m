The benefit is removing the kfree_rcu() special cases from the innards
of RCU, for example, in rcu_do_batch().  Another benefit is removing the
current restriction on the position of the rcu_head structure within the
enclosing data structure.

So it would be good to avoid the current kfree_rcu() special casing within
RCU itself.

Or are you using some trick that avoids both the batching and the current
kfree_rcu() special casing?

It would, but that (1) should not be all that complex, (2) only executes
the one time at boot rather than being an extra check on each callback,
and (3) is in memory that can be reclaimed (though I confess that I am
not sure how many architectures still do this).

Yes, but if I understand your approach correctly, it is unfortunately
not managing to avoid getting rid of the kfree_rcu() special casing.

If you have some trick to nevertheless get rid of the current kfree_rcu()
special casing within RCU proper, sure!
