Dear,

I was shocked you stopped communicating me, I really can't understand
your reason for doing so, but I am very happy now to inform you about
my success in getting the fund out of the bank with the help of a
staff working in the remittance office and also with the special
assistance of a French business woman that catered for other
logistics.

However, I left the sum of $800,000 (Eight Hundred Thousand U.S
Dollars Only) in an ATM cash withdrawal Card. This $800,000 is for you
and it is purposely for your compensation for your little effort in
this transaction. The ATM Card is a global payment card which is
acceptable, workable and usable worldwide in making daily withdrawal
of money from any ATM location.  So you can be able to make
withdrawals of money in any countries on daily basis.

I would have sent the ATM card to your address by myself, but I lack
the time to do that now because I have to urgently meet up with my
business colleagues in Russia. I will be heading to the airport as
soon as I send you this email because I will be traveling out of my
country to Russia where I shall continue with a petroleum business
engagements.

For your good, I left the ATM card with one Mrss.Sumon, now go on and
contact him through his email address so that he can dispatch to you
the ATM card at your contact address.  Simply contact Mrss.Sumon
immediately so that he can send the ATM card to you. Below is the
contact of Mrss.Sumon;

E-Mail:  mrsceline.sumon@yandex.com

Name:    Mrss Celine Sumon

I will no longer be able to email you again.

Bye and best regards,

Mr Ududonka Ahmed.
