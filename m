Yes, this is quite strange.  If setting a smaller timeout makes a
difference, that indicates we're not waking up soon enough.  I see
two possibilities; one is that a wakeup is missing somewhere -- ie the
conditions under which we call clear_wb_congested() are wrong.  Or we
need to wake up sooner.

Umm.  We have clear_wb_congested() called from exactly one spot --
clear_bdi_congested().  That is only called from:

drivers/block/pktcdvd.c
fs/ceph/addr.c
fs/fuse/control.c
fs/fuse/dev.c
fs/nfs/write.c

Jens, is something supposed to be calling clear_bdi_congested() in the
block layer?  blk_clear_congested() used to exist until October 29th
last year.  Or is something else supposed to be waking up tasks that
are sleeping on congestion?
