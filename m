Oops, I totally forgot about this discussion which is just three years
ago.  :)  The QE-HDLC on LS1021a is kind of a special case.

Can you try the 4.14 branch from a newer LSDK release?  LS1021a should
be supported platform on LSDK.  If it is broken, something is wrong.

Understood.  Zhao Qiang also maintains some patches similar to your
patchset and I think they are tested on ARM.  But the review of these
patches from last submission didn't finish.  It looks like your
patches are better divided but not really verified on ARM.  Zhao
Qiang's patches are tested but maybe need some final touch for
cleaning up.  I will let you guys decide what is the best approach to
make this upstreamed.

Leo
