OK, now I'm going to correct myself.  I hope I don't make
any mistakes here because things are confused enough...

Part of what I described previously is still true, namely
there are tables that need to be initialized (i.e., the
IPA needs to be told where they reside), and there is a
separate step is available to zero the content of the tables.

But there really is no need for the AP to hang onto this
DMA memory after this immediate command has been issued.
I will add comments in the code to make it less surprising.

But here's a summary of why.

I think there are two things at play that make it confusing.

The first thing is that these "header tables" are actually
located in a region of shared memory ("smem") that is local
to the IPA (not the AP).  The the IPA_CMD_HDR_INIT_LOCAL
immediate command is meant to:
1) define the header table location in IPA local memory
2) define the header table size
3) provide a buffer used to fill the table with its initial
   contents

The location and size are encoded in the flags field
of the payload (offset and size).

The initial contents are filled via DMA from a buffer
in main memory, whose DMA address is supplied in the
hdr_table_addr parameter in the payload.  The initial
contents we supply are all zero.  So this is why we
need to allocate DMA memory.

The second thing is that this is an instance where the
AP is responsible for performing some initialization
of resources it may not "own" thereafter.  The IPA
hardware owns this table, even though the AP needs to
tell it where it sits in IPA local memory.  The AP is
able to copy (using DMA) content into that table, but
doing so involves a DMA transfer.

More advanced features of the IPA would make more use
of this header table, but those features not yet
supported so this initialization (and a subsequent,
seemingly redundant zeroing) is all we do.

Does that make sense?
