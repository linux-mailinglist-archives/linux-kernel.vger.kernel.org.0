Well, cannot it happen that the flush worker will get stuck in D state
because some subsystem is already suspended and thus hibernation fails
(because AFAIK processes in uninterruptible sleep block hibernation)?

I was also somewhat worried that the hibernation image could be
inconsistent if flush workers do something while hibernation image is being
taken but that does not seem to be a valid concern as all kernel processes
get frozen before hibernation image is taken.
