I don't know why we need to draw a line in the sand and say that if the
kernel doesn't need to know about it then it shouldn't parse it. I want
there to be a consistent userspace ABI that doesn't just move things
straight from memory to userspace in some binary format. I'd rather we
have an ABI that decodes and exposes information about the coreboot
tables through existing frameworks/subsystems where possible and makes
up new ones otherwise.

One concern I have is endianness of the binary data. Is it big endian or
little endian or CPU native endian? The kernel can boot into big or
little endian on ARM platforms and userspace can be different vs. the
bootloader too. Userspace shouldn't need to know this detail, the kernel
should know and do the conversions and expose it somehow. That's why I'm
suggesting in this case we describe fmap as a sysfs class. I don't see
how we could export that information otherwise, besides in a binary blob
that falls into traps like this.

Right now we make devices for all the coreboot table entries, which is
pretty weird considering that some table entries are things like
LB_TAG_LINKER. That isn't a device. It's some information about how
coreboot was linked. We should probably blacklist tags so we don't make
devices and capture these ones in the bus code and expose them in
/sys/firware/coreboot/ somehow. We should also add device randomness
from the serial numbers, etc. that coreboot has stashed away in the
tables.
