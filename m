So I have tried again to reproduce this so that I can look into the
regression. When observing what is actually happening in the system I have
to say that this workfile (or actually its implementation in filebench) is
pretty dubious. The problem is that filebench first creates the files by
writing them through ordinary write(2). Then it immediately starts reading
the files with direct IO read. So what happens is that by the time direct
IO read is running, the system is still writing back the create files and
depending on how read vs writes get scheduled, you get different results.
Also direct IO read will first flush the range it is going to read from the
page cache so to some extent this is actually parallel small ranged
fsync(2) benchmark. Finally differences in how we achieve integrity of
direct IO reads with dirty page cache are going to impact this benchmark.

So overall can now see why this commit makes a difference but the workload
is IMHO largely irrelevant. What would make sense is to run filebench once,
then unmount & mount the fs to force files to disk and clear page cache and
then run it again. Filebench will reuse the files in this case and then
parallel direct IO readers without page cache are a sensible workload. But
I didn't see any difference in that (even with rotating disk) on my
machines.
