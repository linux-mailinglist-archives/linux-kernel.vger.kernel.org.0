Yup, I confirm that the quick patch kept the situation as-is. I was
going to debug why, but now we know the answer..

Hmmm, regarding "randomness request much too early", how much is time
really a factor here?

I tested leaving the machine even for 15+ minutes, and it still didn't
continue booting: the boot is practically blocked forever...

Or is the thoery that hopefully once the machine is un-stuck, more
sources of entropy will be available? If that's the case, then
possibly (rate-limited):

  "urandom: process XX asked for YY bytes. CRNG not yet initialized"
