The rationale for MOVNTI instruction is supposed to be that it avoids
cache pollution. Aside from the bench that shows MOVNTI to be faster for
the move itself, shouldn't it have an additional benefit in not trashing
the CPU caches?

As string instructions improve, why wouldn't the same improvements be
applied to MOVNTI?
