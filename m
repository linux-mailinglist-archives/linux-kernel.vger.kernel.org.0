I can't take this series without Acks on the firmware calling changes, and I
plan to send my 5.3 patches to Joerg at the end of the week so they get some
time in -next. In which case, I think it may be worth you having a play with
the branch above so we can get a better idea of any additional smmu_impl hooks
you may need.

Not sure I follow you here. Are you talking about qcom_iommu.c?
