My only concern is that the driver might conflict with ACPI methods trying
to do the same thing, e.g. there is one ACPI SDHC instance from GPDWin DSDT
with code like this:

  If ((Arg2 == 0x03))
   {
       ADBG ("DSM 1p8")
       If ((^^I2C7.AVBL == One))
       {
           If ((PMID == One))
           {
               DATA = 0x59
               ^^I2C7.DL03 = BUFF /* \_SB_.PCI0.SHC1.BUFF */
           }
           ElseIf ((PMID == 0x02))
           {
               BUFF = ^^I2C7.XD31 /* \_SB_.PCI0.I2C7.XD31 */
               If ((STAT == Zero))
               {
                   DATA |= 0x10
                   ^^I2C7.XD31 = BUFF /* \_SB_.PCI0.SHC1.BUFF */
               }

               BUFF = ^^I2C7.XD32 /* \_SB_.PCI0.I2C7.XD32 */
               If ((STAT == Zero))

               Sleep (0x0A)
               BUFF = ^^I2C7.XD31 /* \_SB_.PCI0.I2C7.XD31 */
               If ((STAT == Zero))

           }
           ElseIf ((PMID == 0x03))
           {
               Local0 = ^^I2C7.PMI5.GET (One, 0x6E, 0x67)
               Sleep (0x0A)
               Local0 &= 0xF8
               ^^I2C7.PMI5.SET (One, 0x6E, 0x67, Local0)
               Sleep (0x64)
               Local0 = ^^I2C7.PMI5.GET (One, 0x6E, 0x67)
               Sleep (0x0A)
               Local0 |= One

               Sleep (0x0A)
           }
       }

       SDVL = One
       Return (0x03)
   }
