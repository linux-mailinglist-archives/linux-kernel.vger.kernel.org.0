Sorry for making things too complicated.  So, below is the timeline:

2019-11-08
----------

Will posted a patchset containing a patch removing references to
[smp_]read_barrier_depends() from memory-barriers.txt.
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191108170120.22331-1-will@kernel.org/

2019-11-21
----------

I posted a translation of the patch (patchset 1):
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191121193209.15687-1-sj38.park@gmail.com/

2019-11-22
----------

I posted another patchset for the Korean translations (patchset 2):
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20191121234125.28032-1-sj38.park@gmail.com/

2019-11-26
----------

Paul queued the `patchset 1` and `patchset 2`.  He also asked me to
get a review from other Korean, if possible:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191126222004.GV2889@paulmck-ThinkPad-P72/

Same day, Jon queued the `patchset 2` (not `patchset 1`) and noticed the
conflict.  Paul dropped both `patchset 1` and `patchset 2` from his tree.
Maybe this is the start of the confusion.

2019-11-29
----------

I got a review results from another Korean for both patchset 1 and patchset 2.
Because patchset 1 has already merged in Linus's tree, I made another patchset
containing fix of the patchset 1 (patchset 1-1):
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20191129182823.8710-1-sjpark@amazon.de/

Because patchset 2 is not merged in any tree, I made and posted the second
version of the patchset 2 (patchset 2-1):
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191129180837.7233-1-sjpark@amazon.de/


So, patchset 1 is already merged by Jon, and patchset 2 is abandoned.
Patchset 1-1 is waiting for Jon's review, and patchset 2-1 is merged in Will's
tree.  Will would send the patchset 2-1 with his patches again in near future.

Sorry again for introducing messy confusion and hope this to finally make
things clear.  If you have any problem, please let me know.
