Makes sense.

Yes, I considered reusing the same structure and decided against it. I
simply created a common helper. It's trivial enough to do on top after
the fact in the name of clarity. Fundamentally it's cosmetic.

Well, we could but right now they should be the same. As it is, the NUMA
balancer and load balancer overrule each other. I think the scope for
changing that without causing regressions is limited.
