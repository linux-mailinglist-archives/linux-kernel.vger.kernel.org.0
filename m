Let me mention one more thing here...

This is about jiffies_till_sched_qs, I think, used to directly set
jiffies_to_sched_qs.

Of course, they are coupled in case jiffies_to_sched_qs is calculated
from jiffies_till_{first,next}_fqs though, I'm just talking about its
original motivation or concept.
