+MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) control
+=========================================
+
+:Authors: - Richard Gooch <rgooch@atnf.csiro.au> - 3 Jun 1999

+
+Phasing out MTRR use
+====================
+
+MTRR use is replaced on modern x86 hardware with PAT. Direct MTRR use by
+drivers on Linux is now completely phased out, device drivers should use
+arch_phys_wc_add() in combination with ioremap_wc() to make MTRR effective on
+non-PAT systems while a no-op but equally effective on PAT enabled systems.
+
+Even if Linux does not use MTRRs directly, some x86 platform firmware may still
+set up MTRRs early before booting the OS. They do this as some platform
+firmware may still have implemented access to MTRRs which would be controlled
+and handled by the platform firmware directly. An example of platform use of
+MTRRs is through the use of SMI handlers, one case could be for fan control,
+the platform code would need uncachable access to some of its fan control
+registers. Such platform access does not need any Operating System MTRR code in
+place other than mtrr_type_lookup() to ensure any OS specific mapping requests
+are aligned with platform MTRR setup. If MTRRs are only set up by the platform
+firmware code though and the OS does not make any specific MTRR mapping
+requests mtrr_type_lookup() should always return MTRR_TYPE_INVALID.
+
+For details refer to :doc:`pat`.
+
+.. tip::
+  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
+  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
+  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful when you have
+  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
+  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
+  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
+  of image write operations 2.5 times or more.
+
+  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
+  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
+  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
+
+  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
+  MTRRs. These are supported.  The AMD Athlon family provide 8 Intel
+  style MTRRs.
+
+  The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing write-combining. These
+  are supported.
+
+  The VIA Cyrix III and VIA C3 CPUs offer 8 Intel style MTRRs.
+
+  The CONFIG_MTRR option creates a /proc/mtrr file which may be used
+  to manipulate your MTRRs. Typically the X server should use
+  this. This should have a reasonably generic interface so that
+  similar control registers on other processors can be easily
+  supported.
+
+There are two interfaces to /proc/mtrr: one is an ASCII interface
+which allows you to read and write. The other is an ioctl()
+interface. The ASCII interface is meant for administration. The
+ioctl() interface is meant for C programs (i.e. the X server). The
+interfaces are described below, with sample commands and C code.
+
+
+Reading MTRRs from the shell
+============================
+::
+
+  % cat /proc/mtrr
+  reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
+  reg01: base=0x08000000 ( 128MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
+
+Creating MTRRs from the C-shell::
+
+  # echo "base=0xf8000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr
+
+or if you use bash::
+
+  # echo "base=0xf8000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" >| /proc/mtrr
+
+And the result thereof::
+
+  % cat /proc/mtrr
+  reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
+  reg01: base=0x08000000 ( 128MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
+  reg02: base=0xf8000000 (3968MB), size=   4MB: write-combining, count=1
+
+This is for video RAM at base address 0xf8000000 and size 4 megabytes. To
+find out your base address, you need to look at the output of your X
+server, which tells you where the linear framebuffer address is. A
+typical line that you may get is::
+
+  (--) S3: PCI: 968 rev 0, Linear FB @ 0xf8000000
+
+Note that you should only use the value from the X server, as it may
+move the framebuffer base address, so the only value you can trust is
+that reported by the X server.
+
+To find out the size of your framebuffer (what, you don't actually
+know?), the following line will tell you::
+
+  (--) S3: videoram:  4096k
+
+That's 4 megabytes, which is 0x400000 bytes (in hexadecimal).
+A patch is being written for XFree86 which will make this automatic:
+in other words the X server will manipulate /proc/mtrr using the
+ioctl() interface, so users won't have to do anything. If you use a
+commercial X server, lobby your vendor to add support for MTRRs.
+
+
+Creating overlapping MTRRs
+==========================
+::
+
+  %echo "base=0xfb000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-combining" >/proc/mtrr
+  %echo "base=0xfb000000 size=0x1000 type=uncachable" >/proc/mtrr
+
+And the results::
+
+  % cat /proc/mtrr
+  reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
+  reg01: base=0xfb000000 (4016MB), size=  16MB: write-combining, count=1
+  reg02: base=0xfb000000 (4016MB), size=   4kB: uncachable, count=1
+
+Some cards (especially Voodoo Graphics boards) need this 4 kB area
+excluded from the beginning of the region because it is used for
+registers.
+
+NOTE: You can only create type=uncachable region, if the first
+region that you created is type=write-combining.
+
+
+Removing MTRRs from the C-shel
+==============================
+::
+
+  % echo "disable=2" >! /proc/mtrr
+
+or using bash::
+
+  % echo "disable=2" >| /proc/mtrr
+
+
+Reading MTRRs from a C program using ioctl()'s

-Even if Linux does not use MTRRs directly, some x86 platform firmware may still
-set up MTRRs early before booting the OS. They do this as some platform
-firmware may still have implemented access to MTRRs which would be controlled
-and handled by the platform firmware directly. An example of platform use of
-MTRRs is through the use of SMI handlers, one case could be for fan control,
-the platform code would need uncachable access to some of its fan control
-registers. Such platform access does not need any Operating System MTRR code in
-place other than mtrr_type_lookup() to ensure any OS specific mapping requests
-are aligned with platform MTRR setup. If MTRRs are only set up by the platform
-firmware code though and the OS does not make any specific MTRR mapping
-requests mtrr_type_lookup() should always return MTRR_TYPE_INVALID.

-
-  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
-  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
-  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful when you have
-  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
-  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
-  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
-  of image write operations 2.5 times or more.
-
-  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
-  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
-  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.
-
-  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
-  MTRRs. These are supported.  The AMD Athlon family provide 8 Intel
-  style MTRRs.
-
-  The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing write-combining. These
-  are supported.
-
-  The VIA Cyrix III and VIA C3 CPUs offer 8 Intel style MTRRs.
-
-  The CONFIG_MTRR option creates a /proc/mtrr file which may be used
-  to manipulate your MTRRs. Typically the X server should use
-  this. This should have a reasonably generic interface so that
-  similar control registers on other processors can be easily
-  supported.
-
-
-There are two interfaces to /proc/mtrr: one is an ASCII interface
-which allows you to read and write. The other is an ioctl()
-interface. The ASCII interface is meant for administration. The
-ioctl() interface is meant for C programs (i.e. the X server). The
-interfaces are described below, with sample commands and C code.
-
-===============================================================================
-Reading MTRRs from the shell:
-
-% cat /proc/mtrr
-reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
-reg01: base=0x08000000 ( 128MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
-===============================================================================
-Creating MTRRs from the C-shell:
-# echo "base=0xf8000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr
-or if you use bash:
-# echo "base=0xf8000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" >| /proc/mtrr
-
-And the result thereof:
-% cat /proc/mtrr
-reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
-reg01: base=0x08000000 ( 128MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
-reg02: base=0xf8000000 (3968MB), size=   4MB: write-combining, count=1
-
-This is for video RAM at base address 0xf8000000 and size 4 megabytes. To
-find out your base address, you need to look at the output of your X
-server, which tells you where the linear framebuffer address is. A
-typical line that you may get is:
-
-(--) S3: PCI: 968 rev 0, Linear FB @ 0xf8000000
-
-Note that you should only use the value from the X server, as it may
-move the framebuffer base address, so the only value you can trust is
-that reported by the X server.
-
-To find out the size of your framebuffer (what, you don't actually
-know?), the following line will tell you:
-
-(--) S3: videoram:  4096k
-
-That's 4 megabytes, which is 0x400000 bytes (in hexadecimal).
-A patch is being written for XFree86 which will make this automatic:
-in other words the X server will manipulate /proc/mtrr using the
-ioctl() interface, so users won't have to do anything. If you use a
-commercial X server, lobby your vendor to add support for MTRRs.
-===============================================================================
-Creating overlapping MTRRs:
-
-%echo "base=0xfb000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-combining" >/proc/mtrr
-%echo "base=0xfb000000 size=0x1000 type=uncachable" >/proc/mtrr
-
-And the results: cat /proc/mtrr
-reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
-reg01: base=0xfb000000 (4016MB), size=  16MB: write-combining, count=1
-reg02: base=0xfb000000 (4016MB), size=   4kB: uncachable, count=1
-
-Some cards (especially Voodoo Graphics boards) need this 4 kB area
-excluded from the beginning of the region because it is used for
-registers.
-
-NOTE: You can only create type=uncachable region, if the first
-region that you created is type=write-combining.
-===============================================================================
-Removing MTRRs from the C-shell:
-% echo "disable=2" >! /proc/mtrr
-or using bash:
-% echo "disable=2" >| /proc/mtrr
