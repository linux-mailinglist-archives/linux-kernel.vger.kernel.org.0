If you don't understand English, it will be difficult to get any points 
across to you. I will try

In simple terms:
1) Look up the court case "Universal City Studios Inc v Reimerdes,"

2) In this case someone else' software was running at the same time as 
the other persons software, and made changes, extensions _ONLY_ when 
running. Just like a non-gpl'd (or gpl'd) module might make changes and 
extensions.

3) The court found this was obviously a modification of the Copyright 
owners Work and barred in on summary judgement.

That is why you're not allowed to do as you wish with non-gpl'd modules: 
the US Copyright Jurisprudence forbids marring a Copyright owners 
_running_ _in_memory_ property against his wishes: it's a Copyright 
violation.

That is the reason: people don't want to get sued. That is the ONLY 
reason. That's it.

The thing is, the linux copyright owners are wimps and won't sue anyone 
even for blatant infringement; so what is the conversation about?

It's like if you were in Russia, and you were copying DVDs. No one is 
going to punish you for it: so what is there to discuss? The US 
Copyright owners don't have the rocks to Invade Russia, Start a Nuclear 
Winter, and DESTROY you for your Copyright Infringement in Russia.

JUST AS, the DOG LIKE Linux Copyright owners don't have the BALLS to 
risk being blackballed from the programming industry for DEFENDING THEIR 
COPYRIGHT.

The GPL ___IS___ dead. The FSF doesn't protect GCC copyright, and is 
opposed to taking any action against blantant in-writing infringers 
(OpenSourceSecurity (Grsecurity)) of GCC, just as the LINUX COMMUNITY is 
OPPOSED to taking ANY action to defend its Copyrights and moves to 
PUNISH those rightsholders who do.

I'm a lawyer and a programmer, got something to say?


> How about talking with real names?
Why would I do that? Tell me? What is in it for me?
I can stand here, in the forest, taking shots at your bullshit. Safe. 
Secure. My words and their veracity the only measure.

But if I reveal the messanger; you'll just attack the messenger.
Tell me how _I_ benifit from telling YOU my name. Tell me.
Is it some sort of stupid werkin man white man bravado?

You sent a message to the LKML "Hey why can't I violate the GPL? Let's 
just do it!". IE: a licensing discussion. RMS and Bruce Perens, the 
founder of the Free Software Movement and the Open Source Initiative are 
relevant parties to the discussion.

You also suggested I reveal my identity on the internet...
