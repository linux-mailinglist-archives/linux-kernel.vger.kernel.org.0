I did a 12-hour run with the same configuration except for leaving out the
"nohz_full=1-7" kernel parameter without problems (aside from the RCU CPU
stall warnings due to the ftrace_dump() at the end of the run -- isn't
there some way to clear the ftrace buffer without actually printing it?).

My next step is to do an over-the-weekend run with the same configuration,
then a similar run with more recent kernel and qemu but with the
"nohz_full=1-7".  If both of those pass, I will consider this to be a
KVM/qemu bug that has since been fixed.

							Thanx, Paul
