Ah yes. Maybe the problem is that split_lock_init() is only
called on systems that support split loc detect, while we call
split_lock_init() unconditionally.

What if we start with sld_state = sld_off, and then have split_lock_setup
set it to either sld_warn, or whatever the user chose on the command
line.  Patch below (on top of patch so you can see what I'm saying,
but will just merge it in for next version.
