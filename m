Hi Andrew

    It sounds good. ButWe still have to look at the actual situation. In here, this comparisons with unsigned
quantities doesn't improvereadability. In turn, the code give user a wrongdescription  as man page said "
If arg2 is less than or equal to zero, the "current" timer slack is reset to the thread's default" timer slack value."

If we set -1 in user space, we pass it into kernel as ULONG_MAX, it will not use default timer_slack value.

Also, I guess that if value has no actual sense we can use this comparisons. In here, arg2 represents slack time.
time will never less than 0.

ps: whether we change or not change this comparisons, it doesn't affect logic. So if you think this patch is meaningless,
I will accept it.

Thanks
