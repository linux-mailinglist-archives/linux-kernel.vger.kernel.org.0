Well, I think my contribution is less than yours :)

Well, I had planned to review it again and promised to send out a new
version. But as usual this ToDo becomes hidden by always more important
tasks.

So I am fine if you can pick comments and resend it. I think there will
be others who help to make it even better in the future if the mount matrix
is more widely used.

Nikolaus
