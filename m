Hi Rob,

Thank you for the patch.

If your firmware can modify the status property of a panel, it can also
add DT nodes. As discussed before, I don't think this belongs to DT.
Even if panel-id isn't used by the operating system, you have Linux
kernel patches in this series that show that this isn't transparent.

This needs to be handled in the firmware (or, if not possible, in a
kernel board driver). The above DT fragment, visible to the kernel,
doesn't describe the actual hardware. Furthermore, you would require all
bridge drivers to be patched to support this method, which shows again
that the issue isn't handled in the right place.

Finally, unless I'm mistaken, this series is meant to support display
for an ACPI-based ARM machine. Using DT as a stop-gap measure because
ACPI support isn't there yet is fine out-of-tree, and fine by me in-tree
provided that the DT bindings are clean, but not when DT is abused like
this.

I'm sorry, but this is a NACK from me. Please handle this transparently
in the firmware if you want DT-based boot, or with ACPI.
