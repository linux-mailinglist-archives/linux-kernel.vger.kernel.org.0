I don't get it. That commit log talks about needing to ensure that the
backpointer is cleared under the lock which is fine, but I don't see why
we need to keep it in the inode's rbtree until that point.

Unhashing an object before you potentially free it is just good
practice, IMO. If we need to do something different here, then I think
it'd be good to add a comment explaining why.
