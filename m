The last patchset submission was here [1]. It had some issues but the
main one was that they wanted the page tables to be created and removed
dynamically. I took a crack at it and ran into some issues and haven't
had time to touch it since. I was waiting to see how arm64[2] solves
similar problems and then maybe it can be made common.

It's also a bit of a PITA because the RISC-V hardware we have with hacky
PCI support is fragile and stopped working on recent kernels, last I
tried. So this hasn't been a priority for us.

Agreed. I tried expanding the SG-list to allow for page-less entries and
it was a much bigger mess than what you describe.

Also, I think your analysis is a bit unfair, we don't need to create
pages for the entire 128GB of PCI memory space, we typically only need
the BARs of a subset of devices which is far less. If a system has only
1GB of memory it probably doesn't actually have 128GB of PCI bar spaces
that are sensibly usable.

Yes, it would be nice to get rid of this overhead, but that's a much
bigger long-term project.
