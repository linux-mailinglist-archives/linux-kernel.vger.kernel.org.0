I've always assumed it was for the same reason as the 64KB segment 
length, i.e. it was sufficiently common as an actual restriction, but 
still "good enough" for everyone else. I remember digging up all the 
history to understand what these were about back when I implemented the 
map_sg stuff, and from that I'd imagine the actual values are somewhat 
biased towards SCSI HBAs, since they originated in the block and SCSI 
layers.
