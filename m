Oh, I wasn't demanding anything! Just interested to know if big-endian is
actually being used because it's not something that I'm able to test
sensibly and I haven't see anywhere near the amount of (public) effort to
keep it supported as for little-endian. However, having asked the question,
it's clear that it does have some users so we'll keep maintaining it on a
best-effort basis and rely on those users to let us know if anything breaks.
