Sure I will not be pushing if that turns out to be unfeasible. But I
would like to explore that path before giving up on it.

Will this be the case for other potential users of the similar/same
mechanism? I thought that this would become a more spread mechanism.

I am assuming that has_unmovable_pages would skip over those pages. Your
patch already does that, no?

Well, this is fully under control of the driver, no? Reference count
shouldn't play any role here AFAIU.

Doesn't this return pages back to buddy only when they were marked Buddy
already?

MEM_CANCEL_OFFLINE could gain the reference back to balance the
MEM_GOING_OFFLINE step.

One think that I would like to clarify because my previous email could
be misleading a bit. You do not really have to drop the reference by
releasing the page to the allocator (via put_page). You can also set
the reference count to 0 explicitly. The driver is in control of the
page, right?  And that is the whole point I wanted to make. There is an
explicit control via the reference count which is the standard way to
control the struct page life cycle.

Anyway hooking into __put_page (which tends to be a hot path with
something that is barely used on most systems) doesn't sound nice to me.
This is the whole point which made me think about the whole reference
count approach in the first place.

I do realize that the reference count doesn't solve the problem with
onlining. Drivers still have to special case the onlining and that is
something I really dislike but I do not have a good answer for.

Hmm, so the driver might offline a part of the memory which never got
onlined? Is there really a sensible usecases for that?
