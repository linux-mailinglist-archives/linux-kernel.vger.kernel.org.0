I have an adapter. I also own several official Apple monitors of various
styles and capabilities. The problem is desk space. I need to clean before
I have enough room to setup anything bigger than a laptop.

My understanding has always been that Apple was really sloppy with how
the hardware handled interrupts. On many models, you can't actually
block interrupts in a sane fashion. Because of that, you usually have
to shut up the interrupts by talking to the actual device.

I would not be surprised in the slightest to see that register write
do absolutely nothing. It might be more interesting to just disable
the clear function for all models and see if it still works. I don't
have a PB 150 to test that style, but I do have the other two.

That makes sense. I need to do the same. It's just a pain since a few
models won't boot without a battery.
