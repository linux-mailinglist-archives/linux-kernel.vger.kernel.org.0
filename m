I've learn recently to dislike calling callbacks while holding a lock.
I don't think the current callbacks care, but the requirement imposes a
burden on future callbacks too.

We can combine the two ideas - move the list_del_init() later, and still
protect it with the wq locks.  This avoids holding the lock across the
callback, but provides clear atomicity guarantees.

Subject: [PATCH] Subject: [PATCH] locks: restore locks_delete_lock
 optimization

A recent patch (see Fixes: below) removed an optimization which is
important as it avoids taking a lock in a common case.

The comment justifying the optimisation was correct as far as it went,
in that if the tests succeeded, then the values would remain stable and
the test result will remain valid even without a lock.

However after the test succeeds the lock can be freed while some other
thread might have only just set ->blocker to NULL (thus allowing the
test to succeed) but has not yet called wake_up() on the wq in the lock.
If the wake_up happens after the lock is freed, a use-after-free error occu=
rs.

This patch restores the optimization and reorders code to avoid the
use-after-free.  Specifically we move the list_del_init on
fl_blocked_member to *after* the wake_up(), and add an extra test on
fl_block_member() to locks_delete_lock() before deciding to avoid taking
the spinlock.

To ensure correct ordering for the list_empty() test and the
list_del_init() call, we protect them both with the wq spinlock.  This
provides required atomicity, while scaling much better than taking the
global blocked_lock_lock.

Fixes: 6d390e4b5d48 ("locks: fix a potential use-after-free problem when wa=
keup a waiter")
