I have applied this patch set but it does not help completely. The timings are 
wrong. I don't have access to the hardware now but one thing i tested before i
left (the HW) was to write the NAND timings from the bootloader into the 
denali controller after the driver configured the timings in denali_init. 
After that the driver worked again for me.

Will try the above next week. Skimming over the socfpga.dtsi it seems as if 
on the Intel SocFPGA the OSC1 has a value of 25000000 set in 
socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi (I am currently not sure about the clock tree with all 
the plls and i am missing the value of osc2?). Also right now it seems i am to 
tired to parse denali_setup_data_interface...

As far as i understand the documentation it must be a multiple of 2. The most 
nand flashes i know need one byte for bad block marking so 2 seems to be a 
pretty sane value. The explanation why default value of 
spare_area_skip_bytes=0 of the boot rom is a little unfortunate is also in the 
documentation: The fact that the ECC values might spill into the spare area 
where the bad block marker of the nand is located.
