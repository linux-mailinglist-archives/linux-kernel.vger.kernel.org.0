It may be a case of my lack of understanding of object lifecycles here and not bad design, if as you say creation of sysfs is always part of initialisation then the problem I describe above should not exist (and it may well not, assumptions behind code are hard to grok).

Cool, I did work on adding your example from last week into samples/kobject but I wasn't able to come up with anything that I was totally happy with.  Hard to use API needs minimal concise correct examples right, I'm going to keep at that as I learn more from seeing/patching current kobject code.

Sure thing.

Things that bend ones brain are the funnest to work on ;)
