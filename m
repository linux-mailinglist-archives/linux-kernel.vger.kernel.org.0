Answering my own questions again...  I think the
array-of-chain-of-array case is also solvable.

For array-of-chain, we can simply add all unsignaled dma_fences in the
chain to the array.  The array won't signal until all of them have
which is exactly the same behavior as if we'd added the chain itself.

For chain-of-array, we can add all unsignaled dma_fences in the array
to the same point in the chain.  There may be some fiddling with the
chain numbering required here but I think we can get it so the chain
won't signal until everything in the array has signaled and we get the
same behavior as if we'd added the dma_fence_array to the chain.

In both cases, we end up with either a single array or a single and
destruction doesn't require recursion.  Thoughts?
