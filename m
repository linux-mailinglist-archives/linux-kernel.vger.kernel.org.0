I see; thanks for this explanation. It would be helpful to mention the
backtracking distinction explicitly in the commit message, since it
currently only alludes to it in the first sentence.

It's worth noting that the key values *can* be exposed to userspace when
CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE is selected. On such kernels, a user could
regenerate and read the keys an arbitrary number of times on a CPU of
their choice. From my limited understanding I presume backtracking may
be a concern there?

Great. That's what I'd prefer due to clarity of the code, and I'm not
too concerned by the figures below given it only adds 12 bytes to the
contemporary text size.

Thanks,
Mark.
