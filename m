I don't follow.  If PSTATE.SS is set and MDSCR_EL1.SS is set, the
processor will take a single-step exception as soon as the debug
exceptions are enabled.  That's what I'm seeing.  The hardware bug is
that PSTATE.SS is not cleared on an exception, and MDSCR_EL1.SS is not
cleared on kernel entry from el1.

I'm not 100% sure that PSTATE.SS is supposed to clear on an exception.
The debug handling documentation in the ARM64 manual is extremely hard
to follow.  But I'm pretty sure about this, as you would see this
problem on every processor and it would be obvious.  You could never
continue from a breakpoint, because the following happens when
continuing from a breakpoint in what I'm seeing:

* gdb disables the breakpoint
* gdb does a single step
* The single step triggers when debug excecption are enabled, not
  after the instruction in question.
* gdb restores the breakpoint and continues
* The breakpoint occurs again because the single step never really
  happened.

Not exactly.  If the processor clears PSTATE.SS, why would you need to
clear MDSCR_EL1.SS?  You can just ignore it.  But looking at the git
commit where that code was introduced, I can see that wasn't the reason.

Can a migration happen if kprobes sets up a single-step, does the step,
and an interrupt or page fault happens before the single step occurs?
If so, that single-step will never happen.

I would be hard to reproduce.  I think I could force this to happen by
modifying the kernel to force a migration in the single-step code, but
it would be hard without modifying the kernel.

Ok, here is the disconnect, I think.  If that is the case, then what I'm
seeing is working like it should.  That doesn't work with gdb, though,
gdb expects to be able to single-step and get to the next instruction.
The scenario I mentioned at the top of this email.

Let me look at this a bit more.  I'll look at this on qemu and maybe a
pi.
