They shouldn't be enabled in a production system either. Why would you
want the extra boot time?

I think what's really desired here is a 'Am I booting using DT' call.

That's pretty much the only case I do run. I use UML to run the tests.

That further breaks making it a module. The plan is also to move to
kunit which probably will preclude some hacky hook into setup_arch().
Side effects may need to be fixed for kunit though.

> 3. Can you use overlays for the unit tests if they are loaded as a module?

That was the idea, yes.


4. Make running the unittests a command line option instead of running
if enabled. Still has side effects, but you have to explicitly run it.

A module would still be my preference. If only there was someone
interested in making everything a module... ;)
