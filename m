The name of the function ought to encode its purpose, not its
signature. The system call under discussion operates on processes and
so should be called "process_madvise". That this system call happens
to accept a pidfd to identify the process on which it operates is not
its most interesting aspect of the system call. The argument type
isn't important enough to spotlight in the permanent name of an API.
Pidfds are novel now, but they won't be novel in the future.

We could name system calls with `cat /dev/urandom | xxd` and they'd
still get used. It doesn't follow that all names are equally good.
