Strange, I didn't had that problem (on Marvell platforms).

I understand.

What you propose is, IIRC what I sent in the early version. Here is
what Maxime Ripard pointed with this early implementation:

        I think this doesn't address all the cases. In your case, where you
        have one consumer that is not a clock, and one provider that is a
        clock, it works just fine.

        However, if you have clocks providers chained, for example with one
        oscillator, a clock controller, and a device, the link will be created
        between the device and the controller, but there will be no link
        between the controller and the oscillator.

Ok so this would be a clocks internal mechanism to handle clock
dependencies within the clock tree, with device links to handle
dependencies with external consumers and dependencies.

I get your point. Well, too bad that Lorenzo refused the PCI series
because of this one because PCIe S2RAM won't be supported at all even if
someday someone contributes the "framework ordering black box" you are
talking about, anyway I will not have the time to work on it I am sorry.
