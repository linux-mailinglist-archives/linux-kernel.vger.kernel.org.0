I believe at least initially, a set of statistics can be made
available only when rcutorture or rcuperf module is loaded. That way
they are purely only for debugging and nothing needs to be exposed to
normal kernels distributed thus reducing testability concerns.

rcu_state::gp_max would be trivial to expose through this, but for
other statistics that are more complicated - perhaps
tracepoint_probe_register can be used to add hooks on to the
tracepoints and generate statistics from them. Again the registration
of the probe and the probe handler itself would all be in
rcutorture/rcuperf test code and not a part of the kernel proper.
Thoughts?
