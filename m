For simple code injections eBPF or kprobe works and a tracepoint would
help with that. For example we could add our one line of task information
that we find very useful this way.

For adding controls to limit output for processes, slabs and vmalloc entries
it would be harder to inject code for that. Our solution was to use debugfs.
An alternate could to be add simple sysctl if using debugfs is not appropriate.
As our code illustrated this can be added without changing the existing report
in any substantive way. I think there is value in this and this is core to what
the OOM report should provide. Additional items may be add ons that are
environment specific but these are OOM reporting essentials IMHO.

Unfortunately my argument for this is moot, this can't be done with
eBPF, at least not now.
