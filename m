Yes, compared to regular rb_next() 'branchless' would be unnecessary.

However compared to other node representations that are easier on
the memory footprint (parent pointers or threaded trees) also have
O(1) but still have branches - but most importantly, these approaches
incur in higher overhead for modifications to the tree.

I don't think we want an all or nothing approach as different users in the
kernel have different needs and some users are simply unable to deal with
enlarging data structures, while others have no problem.

Right. We piggyback from the node info we already have available ie when user
iterates down the tree to find a point of insertion.

So we have lib/rbtree_test.c which does functional+latency testing - which I am
planning on updating if this series is merged. I first have some patches that
improve the overall module that are unrelated to this series and therefore
did not send it.
