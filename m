Agreed.

Agreed. But these fallback also need to first check non-availability of large
pages. I am not sure whether CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE config being clear indicates
that conclusively or not. Being a page table leaf entry has a broader meaning
than a large page but that is really not the case today. All leaf entries here
are large page entries from MMU perspective. This dependency can definitely be
removed when there are other types of leaf entries but for now IMHO it feels
bit problematic not to directly associate leaf entries with large pages in
config restriction while doing exactly the same.
