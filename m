Yes, I have seen this problem too. This is not limited to RT even fair class
(find_energy_efficient_cpu path) also have the same issue. There is a window
where we select a CPU for the task and the task being queued there. Because of
this, we may select the same CPU for two successive waking tasks. Turning off
TTWU_QUEUE sched feature addresses this up to some extent. At least it would
solve the cases like multiple tasks getting woken up from an interrupt handler.

Thanks,
Pavan
