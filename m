Split RSS accounting doesn't make reading from mm counters racy. It
makes these counters *wrong*. We flush task mm counters to the
mm_struct once every 64 page faults that a task incurs or when that
task exits. That means that if a thread takes 63 page faults and then
sleeps for a week, that thread's process's mm counters are wrong by 63
pages *for a week*. And some processes have a lot of threads,
compounding the error. Split RSS accounting means that memory usage
numbers don't add up. I don't think it's unreasonable to want a mode
where memory counters to agree with other indicators of system
activity.

Nobody has demonstrated that split RSS accounting actually helps in
the real world. But I've described above, concretely, how split RSS
accounting hurts. I've been trying for over a year to either disable
split RSS accounting or to let people opt out of it. If you won't
remove split RSS accounting and you won't let me add a configuration
knob that lets people opt out of it, what will you accept?
