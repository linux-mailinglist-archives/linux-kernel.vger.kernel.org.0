Dear  Sir,

It took a lot of time to finally find you.

I am Susan William from London; I work with Royal Bank of Scotland,
This letter is highly privileged and it requires your immediate
attention.

You are receiving this letter because your family name connected to a
deceased client Eng. Micheal,  who was a national of your country.

Eng.  Micheal  ,  was involved in a Plane crash with the wife and
Three children in 2003. Eng.  Micheal  ,  had a fixed-term Deposit
with our bank which worth 4.7 million Euros. Since the event of the
Crash, none of his extended family has been located for the claim of
this money.
There is urgent need to present a beneficiary to the bank for the
claim of the inheritance. The bank notified recent to their decision
to declare the inheritance to the government as their only option
since there is no available kin of the deceased to inherit the money.

Given to your nationality with Eng.  Micheal  ,I want to present you
to the bank as the beneficiary for the inheritance.
Forward me your full contact details to enable me call you on phone
for more details, I will offer you 40% of the total funds once the
money is transferred into your account OK.

I look forward to your immediate response.

Kind Regards,
Susan William.
