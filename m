This is obviously a matter of taste. I do not remember anybody
complaining about the data density for the global oom reports.
The amount of data is essentially the same so so there is no real
technical argument one way or another.

That being said, I still do not like the per line stats but I do not
think this is a strong enough matter to argue about. The missing
counters are interesting for oom reports analysis so the patch is
an improvement. If you really do see it important then I will not stand
in the way. One way or another feel free to add

I've had a suspicion something like that happened. In any case using
kvmalloc wouldn't be a bug. It would just be weird because we do not
even fall back to vmalloc for this size IIRC.

Yeah, using kmalloc is fine.
