No, I'm asking what is the case where the line

	*((u32 *)page_private(page)) == F2FS_COMPRESSED_PAGE_MAGIC

returns false?

The same place where the pages are stored.

This seems to be a bug in f2fs_kmalloc() -- it inappropriately falls back to
kvmalloc().  As per its name, it should only use kmalloc().  f2fs_kvmalloc()
already exists, so it can be used when the fallback is wanted.

It used to be the case that f2fs_msg() was ratelimited.  What stops it from
spamming the logs now?

The problem with a bare printk is that it doesn't show which filesystem instance
the message is coming from.

"Not enough room" is the only reasonable way for compression to fail, so all
that's needed is the ability for compression to report errors at all.  What
specifically prevents this approach from working?

The verity work can read pages from the file which require decryption.  I'm
concerned that it could deadlock if the work is scheduled on the same workqueue.
Granted, I'm not an expert in Linux workqueues, so if you've investigated this
and determined that it's safe, can you explain why?
