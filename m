Thanks your reply.

Let's to introduce why I hit this: I have a module driver that can works using
4.19 kernel version, it breaks when I use the 5.3 kernel. While I checked that
blk_init_queue has been removed by commit <a1ce35fa4985>
("block: remove dead elevator code"), but there is still something about it in
this document.
