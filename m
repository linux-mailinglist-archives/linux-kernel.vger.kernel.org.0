Indeed.

This is more or less what I had in mind with the exception that the "low
utilisation" part of the comment would go away. The 50% utilisation may
be unnecessary and was based simply on the idea that at that point memory
bandwidth, HT considerations or both would also be dominating factors. I
can leave out the check and add it in as a separate patch if proven to
be necessary.
