So, you results show that sched_idle class doesn't provide the
intended behavior because it still delay the scheduling of sched_other
tasks. In fact, the wakeup path of the scheduler doesn't make any
difference between a cpu running a sched_other and a cpu running a
sched_idle when looking for the idlest cpu and it can create some
contentions between sched_other tasks whereas a cpu runs sched_idle
task.
Viresh (cced to this email) is working on improving such behavior at
wake up and has sent an patch related to the subject:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/25/251
I'm curious if this would improve the results.

Vincent
