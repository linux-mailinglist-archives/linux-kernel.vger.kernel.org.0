I didn't get your comment here. Since you put the question under a pile of
words in the commit message, and actually in the changelog, not even in the
message, I repeated it clearly that clock maintainers can see it.

You already got one from Maxime.

It needs to be carefully tested on other platforms than yours.

Have you considered !CLK case?

So, this means that above code requires elaboration in the comments to explain
how it supposed to work.
