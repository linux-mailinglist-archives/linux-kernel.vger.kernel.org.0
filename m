LMKD is just Android's userspace low-memory-killer daemon. It's been around for
a while.

This patch (simple_lmk) is meant to serve as an immediate solution for the
devices that'll never see a single line of PSI code running on them, which
amounts to... well, most Android devices currently in existence. I'm more of a
cowboy who made this patch after waiting a few years for memory management
improvements on Android that never happened. Though it looks like it's going to
happen soon(ish?) for super new devices that'll have the privilege of shipping
with PSI in use.

I'd check for myself, but I can't seem to find kernel source for an Android Go
device...

This seems more confusing though. Why would the ultra-low-end devices use LMKD
while other devices use the broken lowmemorykiller driver?

Agreed, but nearly all OEMs that use Qualcomm chipsets roll with Qualcomm's
kernel decisions, so Qualcomm has a bit of influence here.

For the same mysterious reason that Qualcomm and others cling to
lowmemorykiller, I presume. This is part of what's been confusing me for quite
some time...

LMKD as in Android's low-memory-killer daemon. It is in AOSP, but it looks like
it's still a work in progress.
