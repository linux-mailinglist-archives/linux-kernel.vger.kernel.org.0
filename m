This seems really odd of an interface. Also I don't see how you can avoid
looking up reverse maps to determine if a page is really idle.

What is also more odd is that traditionally clear_refs does interfere with
reclaim due to clearing of accessed bit. Now you have one of the interfaces
with clear_refs that does not interfere with reclaim. That is makes it very
inconsistent. Also in this patch you have 2 interfaces to solve this, where
as my patch added a single clean interface that is easy to use and does not
need parsing of address ranges.

All in all, I don't see much the point of this honestly. But thanks for
poking at it.

thanks,
