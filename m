I have added a cond_resched() to the offending loop, but a close look implies
that code is called with a lock held in another (less common) path so that
can't be directly committed and so CONFIG_PREEMPT won't help.

Indeed requiring CONFIG_PREEMPT doesn't help when customers are running
the application, nor (probably) on AWS since I doubt it is ever the default.

Does the same apply to non-RT tasks?
I can select almost any priority, but RT ones are otherwise a lot better.

I've also seen RT processes delayed by the network stack 'bh' that runs
in a softint from the hardware interrupt.
That can take a while (clearing up tx and refilling rx) and I don't think we
have any control over the cpu it runs on?

The cost of ftrace function call entry/exit (about 200 clocks) makes it
rather unsuitable for any performance measurements unless only
a very few functions are traced - which rather requires you know
what the code is doing :-(
