Which means that if you have to call it N times then it is O(N^2) and
that is the case here because you are adding N memblocks. See
memory_dev_init
  for each memblock
    add_memory_block
      init_memory_block
        find_memory_block_by_id # checks all existing devices
        register_memory
	  device_register # add new device
  
In this particular case find_memory_block_by_id is called mostly to make
sure we are no re-registering something multiple times which shouldn't
happen so it sucks to spend a lot of time on that. We might think of
removing that for boot time but who knows what kind of surprises we
might see from crazy HW setups.

The main question is whether replacing the linked list with a radix tree
in the generic code is something more meaningful.
