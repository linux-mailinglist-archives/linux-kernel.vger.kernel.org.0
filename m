Yes, specifying that compaction in that context is for the entire zone
without any specific allocation context or request.

And in itself, why does that matter?

Sure, but then you have to check that every check on order understands
the new special value.

Yes, it can be expressed as unsigned but in itself why does that justify
the review of a large series? There is limited to no performance gain
and functionally it's equivalent.

No, but the existing code did make that choice and has been debugged
with that decision.

And the advantage is?

So, while it is possible, the point still holds. There is marginal to no
performance advantage (some CPUs perform fractionally better when an
index variable is unsigned rather than signed but it's difficult to
measure even when you're looking for it). It'll take time to review and
then debug the entire series. If this was in the context of a larger
functional enablement or performance optimisation then it would be
worthwhile but as it is, it looks more like churn for the sake of it.
