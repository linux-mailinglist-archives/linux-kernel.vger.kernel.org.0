Changes since v1:

* Changed to extend an existing regex line, instead of adding a new line
  (suggested by Joe Perches). Adjusted the commit description slightly
  to match.

In order to support the get-lore-mbox.py tool described in [1], I ran:

    git format-patch --base=3D<commit> --cover-letter <revrange>

...which generated a "base-commit: <commit-hash>" tag at the end of the
cover letter, just like you can see at the end of this cover letter.
However, checkpatch.pl generated an error upon encounting
"base-commit:" in the cover letter.

So, I suspect that no one is actually using the --base option yet, but
if [1] leads to get-lore-mbox.py and similar scripts becoming popular,
then we'll want checkpatch.pl to work well with them. This tiny patch
does that.

An alternative approach to fixing this would be to make the --base
option emit a checkpatch-friendly commit style. However, I think that's
much less desirable, because base-commit is really just for tools
(mainly "git am") to consume. And so we don't really want it to take up
any more valuable lines in the commit letter than it already does.

thanks,
