Looks good on a cursory check, and I'm inclined to go with this since
it's less fiddly for people to backport.

One other difference to note -- we are holding the fl_wait lock when
calling lm_notify, but I don't think it will matter to any of the
existing lm_notify functions.

If you want to clean up the changelog and resend that would be great.

Thanks,
