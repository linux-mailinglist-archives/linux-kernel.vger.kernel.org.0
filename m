Hi Jirka,

 > I see.. can't we just check sysid for uncore PMUs?

x86 will still alias PMUs (uncore or CPU) based on an alias table 
matched to the cpuid, as it is today. x86 has the benefit of fixed 
uncore PMUs for a given cpuid.

For other archs whose uncore or system PMUs are not fixed for a given 
CPU - like arm - we will support matching uncore and system PMUs on 
cpuid or sysid.

Uncore PMUs are a grey area for arm, as they may or may not be tied to a 
specific cpuid, so we will need to support both matching methods.

Not exactly.

The code will match on an alias table matched to the cpuid and also an 
alias table matched to the sysid (if perf could actually get a sysid and 
there is a table matching that sysid).

I hope that this makes sense....
