OK, so it seems the following two tests failed for them[0]:

>          ❌ Networking sctp-auth: sockopts test [10]

fuzz[1] seems to be a redhat test that was added to tests-beaker on May
20th this year. Similarly, sockopts[2] was added on May 7th.

We don't run tests-beaker. Maybe we should?

Major is coming to Linaro Connect in a few weeks to talk about CKI[3].
Topics such as test coverage and test suites are on our agenda to
discuss.

Hope that helps,
Dan
