Sure. I tested registering various callbacks against PERF events (since they're
what I have available on my platform implementation); I used probe() in scmi-genpd
and scmi-cpufreq to register generic testing callbacks like:

scmi_cpufrq_probe()

...
	src_id = 0x00;
	handle->notify_ops->register_event_notifier(handle, SCMI_PROTOCOL_PERF,
						    0x1, &src_id, &my_cpufreq_nb);

and removing similarly in remove().

I'll send you my debug patches that includes genpd/cpufreq callbacks registration and
an additional dummy driver that just registers perf callbacks so you can have a better idea
of the intended usage.

Regarding sensors it could be something like:


	sensor_id = 0x00;

	handle->notify_ops->register_event_notifier(handle, SCMI_PROTOCOL_SENSOR,
						    0x0, &sensor_id, &my_sensor_nb);

	handle->sensor_ops->trip_point_config(handle, sensor_id, 0, 10000);
  
Note that the notification core takes care on its own of enabling the specific events generation
when you register the first callback for a specific event as identified by (proto_id, event_id, src_id)
but in the case of the sensor protocol you'll need to explicitly setup the trip_point too.

As a result when the trip point is crossed you'll receive in your callback a sensor_report
(as in include/linux/scmi_protocol.h) as your data arg.

I just realized that being the notification enable method (trip_notify) also exposed by the ops directly,
I should probably add some sort of alert for a user...since it is not meant to be used directly when
the notification subsystem is being used....I'll think about this pitfall.

Sorry I did not get what you mean here.
