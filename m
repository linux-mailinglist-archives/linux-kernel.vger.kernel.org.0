Well, I don't think that's a good idea. ->cmd_buf is an array in the
middle of the spi_nor struct, which means it won't be aligned on a
cache line and you'll have to be extra careful not to touch the spi_nor
fields when calling spi_mem_exec_op(). Might work, but I wouldn't take
the risk if I were you.

Another option would be to allocate ->cmd_buf with kmalloc() instead of
having it defined as a static array.

I think I added the addr param for a good reason (probably to support
Octo mode cmds that take an address parameter). This being said, I
agree with you, we should just pass everything through the op parameter
(including the address if we ever need to add one).

But it breaks the reverse-xmas-tree formatting :-).

Hm, passing the buffer to send data from/receive data into is already
part of the spi_mem_op definition process (which is done in the caller
of this func) so why bother passing an extra arg to the function.
Note that you had the exact opposite argument for the
spi_nor_spimem_xfer_reg() prototype you suggested above (which I
agree with BTW) :P.

The semantic is well documented in the doc just above the function, but
I have the feeling that you're in 'nitpick' mode, so I'll just let you
pick the one you prefer :).

Indeed, doesn't make sense to pass this info since it could be passed
through the op->data field.
