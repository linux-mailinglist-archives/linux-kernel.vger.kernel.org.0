Agreed, in many cases we won't be able to panic() the system properly,
deadlocking somewhere in smp_send_stop().

Yes!

Great!

This is the only case when we actually need to pay attention to
num_online_cpus(), because there is an active logbuf_lock owner;
in any other case we can unconditionally re-init printk() locks.

But there is more to it.

Note, that the problem in scenario 3 is bigger than just logbuf_lock.
Regardless of logbuf implementation we will not be able to panic()
the system.

If we have a never ending source of printk() messages, coming from
misbehaving CPU which stuck in printing loop in IRQ context, then
flush_on_panic() will never end or kmsg dump will never stop, etc.
We need to cut off misbehaving CPUs. Panic CPU waits (for up to 1
second?) in smp_send_stop() for secondary CPUs to die, if some
secondary CPUs are still chatty after that then most likely those
CPUs don't have anything good to say, just a pointless flood of same
messages over and over again; which, however, will not let panic
CPU to proceed.

And this is where the idea of "disconnecting" those CPUs from main
logbuf come from.

So what we can do:
- smp_send_stop()
- disconnect all-but-self from logbuf (via printk-safe)
- wait for 1 or 2 more extra seconds for secondary CPUs to leave
  console_unlock() and to redirect printks to per-CPU buffers
- after that we are sort of good-to-go: re-init printk locks
  and do kmsg_dump, flush_on_panic().

Note, misbehaving CPUs will write to per-CPU buffers, they are not
expected to be able to flush per-CPU buffers to the main logbuf. That
will require enabled IRQs, which should deliver stop IPI. But we can
do even more - just disable print_safe irq work on disconnect CPUs.

So, shall we try one more time with the "disconnect" misbehaving CPUs
approach? I can send an RFC patch.
