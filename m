Yes, exactly. Our in-house implementation was just converted to use 
workqueue instead of dedicated kernel thread for each cgroup.

Actually I'm wondering if we really need account CPU cycles used by 
background reclaimer or not. For our usecase (this may be not general), 
the purpose of background reclaimer is to avoid latency sensitive 
workloads get into direct relcaim (avoid the stall from direct relcaim). 
In fact it just "steal" CPU cycles from lower priority or best-effort 
workloads to guarantee latency sensitive workloads behave well. If the 
"stolen" CPU cycles are accounted, it means the latency sensitive 
workloads would get throttled from somewhere else later, i.e. by CPU share.

We definitely don't want to the background reclaimer eat all CPU cycles. 
So, the whole background reclaimer is opt in stuff. The higher level 
cluster management and administration components make sure the cgroups 
are setup correctly, i.e. enable for specific cgroups, setup watermark 
properly, etc.

Of course, this may be not universal and may be just fine for some 
specific configurations or usecases.
