see other email, the platform bus is handled by a platform 
device/driver. There was no intention to change that, it's by design 
rather than an omission/error.

sdw_master_device_add() returns a struct_master_device *md, so the 
parent has a handle to that device. See the device creation here:

https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/blob/9c7487b33072040ab755d32ca173b75151c0160c/drivers/soundwire/intel_init.c#L238

This startup() would be called by the parent when all 
requirements/dependencies are met. Put differently, it allows the probe 
to run much earlier and check for platform firmware information (which 
links are enabled, what devices are exposed by platform firmware), while 
the startup is really when the bus clk/data lines will start toggling.

https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/blob/9c7487b33072040ab755d32ca173b75151c0160c/drivers/soundwire/intel_init.c#L341

and the call from the SOF layer is here:

https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/blob/9c7487b33072040ab755d32ca173b75151c0160c/sound/soc/sof/intel/hda-loader.c#L418

Again, if everything is ready at probe time there's no need to delay the 
actual bus startup. This is not needed for Qualcomm platforms where the 
Master device is part of a codec. It's actually irrelevant since there 
is no driver, so the startup callback does not even exist :-)

That's a fair point, we could add a state variable and a check that the 
probe happened before.

In practice the two cases of device creation and startup are different 
phases so it'd more of a paranoia check.

Thanks,
