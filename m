Sounds reasonable to me. From the current parameters for x86, it only
impact the bootloader during boot-time, e.g 'mem=3D ' says bootloader need
this to place initrd. It might not give the trouble, anyway, we will
say.

Just a little more, we have test case for memory hotplug which only test
the DIMM added after boot. And the old 'mem=3D ' implementation in x86
only erazes memory regions above 'mem=3D ' in e820 table. That is why the
behaviour change immediately gave me a surprise when I noticed people
back ported Jurgen's patch to our distros.=20

So glad to see all is clear, thanks.
