Hi Lakshmi,

Instead of loosing the cover letter, Jonathan Corbet suggested
including it as the merge comment.  I'd like to do that with this
cover letter.

The first sentence and the clause of the next sentence are
unnecessary.  I would begin the cover letter with "The IMA subsystem
supports" and add the reference afterwards.

Let's not limit the example to just the .builtin_trusted_keys keyring.
 Please update it as:

This includes keys added, for instance, to either the .ima or
.builtin_trusted_keys keyrings, which happens early in the boot
process.

As the merge message, this is too much information.  I would extend
the previous paragraph and drop this one, like:
"... (not queued).  In the case when a custom policy is not loaded
within 5 minutes of IMA initialization, the queued keys are freed."

> This is by design.

It's unclear what "is by design" refers to.  Perhaps expand this
sentence like: "Measuring the early boot keys, by design, requires
loading a custom policy.
