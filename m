Sort of.  The rcu delay happens when release_task calls
delayed_put_task_struct.  Which unfortunately means that anytime after
exit_notify, release_task can operate on a task.  So it is possible
that by the time do_dead_task is called the rcu grace period is up.


Which is the problem the users of task_rcu_dereference are fighting.
They are performing an rcu walk on the set of cups in task_numa_migrate
and in the userspace membarrier system calls.

For a short while we the rcu delay in put_task_struct but that required
changes all of the place and was just a pain to work with.

Then I did:

About a decade later task_struct grew some new rcu users and Oleg
introduced task_rcu_dereference to deal with them:

So I think it makes a lot of sense to change how we do this.  Either
moving the rcu delay back into put_task_struct or doing halfway like
creating a put_dead_task_struct that will perform the rcu delay after
a task has been taken off the run queues and has stopped being a zombie.
