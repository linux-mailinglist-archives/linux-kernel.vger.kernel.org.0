Which older kernels? This is a new binding, adding a new driver, so if
an older kernel uses a separate driver with its own binding, good for
them, but we don't have to support it.

A connector isn't a panel.

And the innolux,n116bge is certainly not a connector either.

No-one asked to do an edp-connector driver. You should use it in your
DT, but if you want to have some code in your driver that parses the
DT directly, I'm totally fine with that.

I guess you should describe why do you think it's "clear", because I'm
not sure this is obvious for everyone here. eDP allows to discover
which device is on the other side and its supported timings, just like
HDMI for example (or regular DP, for that matter). Would you think
it's clearly preferable to ship a DT with the DP/HDMI monitor
connected on the other side exposed as a panel as well?

The binding itself is the ABI, and we will have to support that
binding for pretty much forever.

Properly is arguable.

And that's bindings meant for another use-case.
