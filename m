Good question! I've had a look. Bearing in mind that I'm not an expert
in ppc64 early load, I think it would be possible, but a large chunk of
work.

One challenge is that - as I understand it - the early relocation code
in head_64.S currently allows the kernel to either:
 - run at the address it's loaded at by kexec/the bootloader, or
 - relocate the kernel to 0

As far as I can tell book3s 64bit doesn't have code to arbitrarily
relocate the kernel.

It's possible I'm wrong about this, in which case I'm happy to reasses!

If I'm right, I think we'd want to implement KASLR for book3s first,
along the lines of how book3e does it. That would allow the kernel to be
put at an arbitrary location at runtime. We could then leverage that.

Another challenge is that some of the interrupt vectors are not easy to
relocate, so we'd have to work around that. That's probably not too big
an issue and we'd pick that up in KASLR implementation.

So I think this is something we could come back to once we have KASLR.

Daniel
