I was going by our earlier discussion that the parameter is still writable at
boot time. You mentioned something like the following:
---
In Byungchul's defense, the current module_param() permissions are
0444, which really is read-only.  Although I do agree that they can
be written at boot, one could use this same line of reasoning to argue
that const variables can be written at compile time (or, for on-stack
const variables, at function-invocation time).  But we still call them
"const".
---

Sorry if I got confused. You are right that we could leave it as read-only.

Ok, thank you for the hints. I will try to poke around with these as well. I
am currently also thinking of spending my time on RCU with reviving the list
API patches:
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?series=396464

I noticed the occasional splat even with my preempt-disable test. But that
was just when trace dumping was interfering which we discussed at length last
week.
