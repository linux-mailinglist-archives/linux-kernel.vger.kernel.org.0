But you could extend the command line paradigm to meet your needs.

No.  This is not communicating boot loader information.

That is debugging.  Or if you want to be pedantic, a complex performance
measurement of the boot process (more than holding a stopwatch in your
hand).

Recompiling a single object file (containing the ftrace command data)
and re-linking the kernel is not a big price in that context).  Or if
you create a new communication channel, you will have the cost of
creating that data object (certainly not much different than compiling
a devicetree) and have the bootloader provide the ftrace data object
to the kernel.

Devicetree is not the universal dumping ground for communicating
information to a booting kernel.  Please create another communication
channel.
