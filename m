I'm just not convinced that folks running enclaves that can't communicate
their basic functionality will care one whit about SELinux restrictions,
i.e. will happily give EXECMOD even if it's not strictly necessary.

It would work and is easy to implement *if* SELinux ties permissions to
the process, as the SIGSTRUCT vma/file won't be available at
EAUG+mprotect().  I already have a set of patches to that effect, I'll
send 'em out in a bit.

FWIW, we still need to differentiate W->X from WX on SGX1, i.e. declaring
ALLOW_WRITE + ALLOW_EXEC shouldn't imply WX.  This is also addressed in
the forthcoming updated RFC.
