Last night I remembered there is one place where we currently take
i_mmap_rwsem in read mode and potentially call huge_pmd_unshare.  That
is in try_to_unmap_one.  Yes, there is a potential race here today.
But that race is somewhat contained as you need two threads doing some
combination of page migration and page poisoning to race.  This change
now allows migration or poisoning to race with page fault.  I would
really prefer if we do not open up the race window in this manner.

Getting this right in the try_to_unmap_one case is a bit tricky.  I had
code to do this in the past that was part of a bigger hugetlb synchronization
change.  All those changes got reverted (commit ddeaab32a89f), but I
believe it is possible to change try_to_unmap_one calling sequences
without introducing other issues.

Bottom line is that more changes are needed in this patch.  I'll work
on those changes unless someone else volunteers.  It will likely take me
one or two days to come up with and test proposed changes.
