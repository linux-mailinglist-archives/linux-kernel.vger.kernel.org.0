Live patching is the same as what you have. If not even more critical.

Note, it would be easy to also implement a "just give me IP regs" flag,
or have that be the default if IPMODIFY is set and REGS is not.

That only happens if you have more than one callback to a same
function. Otherwise you get a dedicated trampoline.

Why not have a single ftrace_ops() that calls this utility and do the
multiplexing then?

That was done because kprobes in general work off of int3. And the
saving of pt_regs was to reuse the code and allow kprobes to work both
with or without a ftrace helper.

What about the approach I showed here? Just register a ftrace_ops with
ip modify set, and then call you unique trampoline directly.

It would keep the modification all in one place instead of having
multiple implementations of it. We can make ftrace call your trampoline
just like it was called directly, without writing a whole new
infrastructure.
