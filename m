The iterator approach could be awkward for the likes of my generic
ptdump implementation[1]. It would require an iterator which returns all
levels and allows skipping levels when required (to prevent KASAN
slowing things down too much). So something like:

start_walk_range(&state);
for_each_page_range(&state, page) {
	switch(page->level) {
	case PTE:
		...
	case PMD:
		if (...)
			skip_pmd(&state);
		...
	case HOLE:
		....
	...
	}
}
end_walk_range(&state);

It seems a little fragile - e.g. we wouldn't (easily) get type checking
that you are actually treating a PTE as a pte_t. The state mutators like
skip_pmd() also seem a bit clumsy.
