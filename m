How about the codes as follows:

for (done = 0, retlen = 0; done < size; done += retlen) {
	ret = mtd_read(..., &retlen, ...);
	if (!ret)
		continue;
	/*
	 * do nothing if bitflip and ecc error occurs because whether
	 * it's bitflip or ECC error, just a small number of bits flip
	 * and the impact on log data is so small. The mtdpstore just
	 * hands over what it gets and user can judge whether the data
	 * is valid or not.
	 */
	if (mtd_is_bitflip(ret)) {
		dev_warn("bitflip at....");
		continue;
	} else if (mtd_is_eccerr(ret)) {
		dev_warn("eccerr at....");
		retlen = retlen == 0 ? size : retlen;
		continue;
	} else {
		dev_err("read failure at...");
		/* this zone is broken, try next one */
		return -ENEXT;
	}
}

The usual size of dmesg is 64K, usually be equal to log_buf size.

1. upper layer do not support to skip partially written page
The upper layer pstore/blk will not skip the end of the partially
written page since it is not only used for MTD device, but also
block device, which has no page limited. A common practice at the
upper layer is to check the size and limit size to be aligned. We
make dmesg_size to be a multiple of 4K for greater compatibility.

2. chunks management and size per write
The mtdpstore tells pstore/blk how large the device is. Then
pstore/blk will divide it into several chunks according to
dmesg_size. The pstore/blk will write dmesg_size data at a time.

In a word, the amount of data written each time can not lead to page
slicing, so, dmesg_size must be aligned to writesize.

I want to express that if the write fails due to busy, the next one
may succeed.
