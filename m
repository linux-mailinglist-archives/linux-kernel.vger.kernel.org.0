No it can't do that throughout posix_cpu_timer_del() because exit_itimers()
can only look at current->signal->posix_timers which does not contain the
posix timers owned by a different task/process.

We could of course invoke posix_cpu_timers_exit() from exit_itimers() but
does that buy anything?

We can't. The foreign owned cpu timers are not in cur->signal->posix_timers
so how should we invoke posix_cpu_timer_del() on them. Only the owner task
can. The only thing the exiting task can do is to remove the foreign timer
from it's expiry list which has nothing to do with cur->signal->posix_timers.

cur->signal->posix_timers only contains posix timers which are owned by
current not those which are owned by a different task and armed on the
exiting one.

exit_itimers() handles cur->signal->posix_timers, i.e. timers owned by
current.

posix_cpu_timers_exit() handles timers enqueued on current, which are
foreign owned timers because exit_itimers() removed those which were owned
by current already.

posix_cpu_timers_exit_group() handles timers enqueued on current->signal,
which are foreign owned timers because exit_itimers() removed those which
were owned by current already.

I think so :)
