This patch essentially stops kswapd from going overboard when a failed
allocation fires up kswapd. Otherwise, when memory pressure is really high,
kswapd just chomps through CPU time freeing pages nonstop when it isn't needed.
On a constrained system I tested (mem=2G), this patch had the positive effect of
improving overall responsiveness at high memory pressure.

On systems with more memory I tested (>=4G), kswapd becomes more expensive to
run at its higher scan depths, so stopping kswapd prematurely when there aren't
any memory allocations waiting for it prevents it from reaching the *really*
expensive scan depths and burning through even more resources.

Combine a large amount of memory with a slow CPU and the current problematic
behavior of kswapd at high memory pressure shows. My personal test scenario for
this was an arm64 CPU with a variable amount of memory (up to 4G RAM + 2G swap).
