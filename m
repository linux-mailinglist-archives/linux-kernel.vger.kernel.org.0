Not according to Rabeeh, the SolidRun CTO:

< rabeeh> all i.MX6 based machines from SolidRun are 1Gbps phys
< rabeeh> i thought that we fixed that information, documentation wise;
          but seems not

Even the Carrier1 board that pre-dates Hummingboards had the AR8035
with 1G magnetics.

The schematics I have for the Cubox-i state that the RJ45 jack (which
contains the magnetics) is to be "Gigabit".

There was a 10/100M option for the microsom, which is selected by where
a resistor pack is fitted, having the effect of configuring the AR8035
differently.  I seem to recall the 10/100M option in the early days was
to use a different Atheros PHY.

However, I'm not aware of 10/100M option making it into production, and
Rabeeh's comment (who was involved in the design) confirms that.
