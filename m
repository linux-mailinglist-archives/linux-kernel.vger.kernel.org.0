I understand your point. Unfortunately that would only work if the driver
doesn't set URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP.

$ git grep "=.*URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP" | wc
    115     498   10104

isn't exactly reassuring - a quick checks suggests that almost 50%
of USB drivers set this flag.

So all we'd really accomplish is to give people a false sense of
security.

In this context, I did play around with configuring the real receive
buffer size (ie in my reproducer 1522 instead of 1536). If I do that,
reading the HCTSIZ register after the transfer reports 0x7fff2
(or -14 = 1522-1536 if I treat the value as signed) as actual transfer
size. Maybe that would be an option, if properly handled, but who knows
what the IP actually does in this case, and what it does on other
implementations (not rk3288).
