There is a discussion around this subject in

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190926115548.44000-1-thomas_os@shipmail.org/

The main point is that there is an assert in pud_trans_huge_lock() that 
the mmap_sem is held, and we don't have it. Presumably we should be able 
to get away with the i_mmap_lock, but in addition I would have had to 
include the walk_as_pte_range() as the walk::pmd_entry anyway, so the 
amount of duplicated page walk code isn't that big.

That said, if people are OK with me modifying the assert in 
pud_trans_huge_lock() and make __walk_page_range non-static, it should 
probably be possible to make it work, yes.

Thanks,
Thomas
