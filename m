The pre-generated permutation which we're choosing a random starting
offset into was itself generated with prandom (in freelist_randomize()),
so there's not much point using a crypto-quality generator here.

Also, prandom_u32_max() uses a multiplicative algorithm for generating
random integers in a range, which is faster than modulo.

TODO: Figure out a better algorithm for the whole thing.  A single
permutation with a random starting point is a bit limiting.
Can we make a full shuffle fast enough. or do we need to stick
with something less general?

We could easily add an outer offset: off2 + random_seq[off1 + i]

Perhaps instead of just a random starting point, a random start
and step?  Unfortunately, the step must be relatively prime to the
count, and the latter is not chosen to make things convenient.
But it's easy enough to precompute a list of possible steps.
Or we could at least allow steps of +1 and -1.

Should random_seq be changed periodically?  It's a separately
allocated structure, so it's easy to allocate a new one and swap
it out atomically.

or even an Enigma-style double rotor:
page[i] = off3 + random_seq2[off2 + random_seq1[off1 + i]]
