You are right, It is not required.

Just a bit of history:

A while ago the hdmi-codec was keeping track of the substream pointer.
It was not used for anything useful, other than knowing if device was
busy or not, and it was causing problem with codec-to-codec links

I removed the saved substream pointer and replaced with a simple bit to
track the busy state. Protecting a single bit with a mutex seemed a bit
overkill to me, so I thought it was a good idea to replace the whole
thing with atomic bit ops. [0]

Mark told me he preferred the mutex method as it simpler to understand.
As long as as it works it's fine for me :)

I proposed something that uses the mutex as a busy flag but it turned
out to be a bad idea.

With the revert, we are back to the bit ops. Even if it works, Mark's
original comment on the bit ops still stands I think. This is why I'm
proposing patch 2 but I don't really mind if it is applied or not.
