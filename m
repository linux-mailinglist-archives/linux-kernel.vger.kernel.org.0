Hi,

On behalf of the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board (TAB), I'd =
like to
take this opportunity to announce the voting procedures for the 2019 TAB
elections. As was announced[1], this year we are moving to electronic =
voting.

Everyone who is registered for kernel summit (co-located with Linux =
Plumbers
Conference in Lisbon this year) by September 8th 2019 is eligible to =
vote in
this year's TAB elections. This includes everyone registered for =
Plumbers and
Maintainers summit. All eligible voters will receive a link from
Condorcet Internet Voting Service (https://civs.cs.cornell.edu) by the
start of the first Plumbers session (September 9th 10am UTC+1). The =
voting
will run until September 11th at 10am UTC+1.

The list of all candidates and their platform is available at the =
following
Google doc

=
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3_W1c-xJMx9o2PCnKiGt3vqs-mPh77yNO4GSq=
NipOQ/edit?usp=3Dsharing

We will also be hosting an open TAB session at Plumbers on Monday
September 9th at 18:30. A more detailed FAQ about voting procedures is
below.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to
tab@lists.linux-foundation.org .

Thanks,
Laura

P.S. Please consider this a reminder to send in your TAB nominations!

Q: Why are we making this change?
A: As explained in the previous announcement,
=
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2019-July/0065=
82.html
In person voting has a number of limitations. We'd like to move to =
electronic
voting with the objective of giving more members of our community a =
voice in
the membership of the TAB

Q: Who is eligible to vote?
A: All registered attendees of Plumbers and Kernel Maintainers Summit =
are
eligible.

Q: If I am registered for Plumbers but not attending can I still vote?
A: We will be sending the e-mail to all registered attendees before =
confirming
they are present.

Q: Can I register for Plumbers just to vote?
A: Plumbers is sold out this year.

Q: Why bother with electronic voting if the voting pool is still =
conference
attendees?
A: The kernel philosophy is small incremental changes. Based on =
discussions
with the TAB, changing the voting method and widening the voting pool
simultaneously was too much for one year. The goal is to run the =
electronic
voting this year with the same voting pool and then discuss how voting =
will
work in subsequent years.

Q: When does voting start?
A: E-mails with the voting link will be sent out before the start of the
first Plumbers session on Monday September 9th at 10am UTC+1

Q: When does voting end?
A: Voting ends on September 11th at 10am UTC+1

Q: What's the software used for voting?
A: We will be using the hosted version of the Condorcet Internet Voting =
Service
(CIVS) at https://civs.cs.cornell.edu

Q: Is this code open source?
A: Yes. The code is available under a BSD-like research license

Q: How do I vote?
A: You will receive an e-mail by Monday September 9th at 10am UTC+1 with
a link to vote.

Q: Is this method of voting secure?
A: Privacy and security is a focus of CIVS. See
https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/sec_priv.html for more information.

Q: The website mentions ranked choice voting. What is this?
A: In ranked choice voting, you rank your preferred choices from most
to least liked. The theory is this results in a more accurate =
representation
of what the voter pool wants. This is a different method than we've used
for TAB elections in the past where you indicated your preferred $n out
of $m candidates. Because we are using the hosted version of CIVS, we =
did
not have the option to use our old method of voting.

Q: The description mentions an 'election supervisor'. What is this role?
A: The election supervisor's role is to start and stop the poll, send
links to voters, and set various options for the poll. A single e-mail
address is used to e-mail the link to manage the election, after which
anyone with the link can manage the poll.

Q: Who is the election supervisor for the TAB elections?
A: We have created a mailing list for election management. This mailing
list contains individuals from the kernel community who are not running
for the TAB this year, similar to in-person proctors from past years.
We are still working on getting the mailing list set up, the address =
will
be announced when it is ready.

Q: What if I lose the e-mail before I vote?
A: Please e-mail the election list, address to be announced

Q: What if I want to change my vote?
A: This is not possible, please make sure you've made your final choices
when you click submit.

Q: What if I want to practice voting?
A: CIVS has a number of sample polls available. Feel free to vote in =
those
to see how the process works.

Q: What if something unforeseen happens with electronic voting and we =
don't
end up with results?
A: We will arrange an in person vote similar to previous years.

Q: What if I have questions not addressed here?
A: E-mail tab@lists.linuxfoundation.org for the current Technical =
Advisory
Board or the election list, address to be announced
