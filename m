I think this is really just a problem if there are no dedicated ACTIVE
TCS.  I think rpmh_flush() is pretty quick normally because all it's
doing is writing to register space, not waiting for any transactions
to finish.  The reason it's bad if there are no dedicated ACTIVE TCS
is that now we have to block waiting for the active transaction to
finish.

Grepping for "cpu_pm_notifications" finds nothing, but I think you
mean you're going to register for notifications with
register_pm_notifier().

OK.  I guess I'm a bit confused here, though.  Maybe you can help
clear up my understanding.  I thought that one of the things you were
trying to solve with all the "last man down" type solutions was to
handle when RPMH wanted to transition into its sleep mode without a
full system suspend.  I thought that the RPMH sleep mode ran sometimes
when all the CPUs were idle and we were pretty sure they were going to
be idle for a while.

If this whole time all you've needed is to run at suspend time then it
feels like we could have avoided a whole lot of complexity.  ...but
again, maybe I'm just misunderstanding.

I would just provide a pointer to it in the description.  If it was
already there and I missed it, then sorry.  :(

Ah, this was a patch I wasn't aware of.  I haven't had time to go scan
for patches that weren't pointed in my direction.  I'll go review it
now.  When I briefly looked at trying to solve this problem myself I
seem to remember it being harder to get all the locking right / races
fixed, so I'm a little surprised that patch is so short...  Maybe I
was overthinking...

If you have it working then no need to remove it.  ...but without that
patch it was clearly not working and it was adding a lot of complexity
to handle it.  In fact, this flushing patch series would have likely
been easy to get finalized / landed if we hadn't needed to deal with
the zero active TCS case.  It still feels like an option to say that
the "zero active TCS" case is only supported when you have OSI mode
unless you know of instances where we need that.


Hrm, I see you just posted v14 while I was writing this.  I guess I'll
go check that out now.  Maybe it will answer some of the questions I
had.
