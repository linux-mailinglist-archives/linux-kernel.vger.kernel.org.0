For my understanding, are you saying your AI is reading launchpad bug
reports etc? Because it is marked AUTOSEL.

That pages mentions

"""
2 upstream patch series are required to fix this:
 https://<email address hidden>/msg10328.html
Which provides an EFI facility consumed by:
 https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/21/1066
There were also some follow-on fixes to deal with ARM-specific
problems associated with this usage:
 https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg685751.html
"""

and without the other patches, we only add bugs and don't fix any.

Backporting a feature/fix like this requires careful consideration of
the patches involved, and doing actual testing on hardware.

Yes. By itself, it causes crashes at early boot and does not actually
solve the problem.

This is not a bugfix. kexec/kdump never worked correctly on the
hardware involved, and backporting a feature like that goes way beyond
what I am willing to accept for stable backports affecting the EFI
subsystem.
