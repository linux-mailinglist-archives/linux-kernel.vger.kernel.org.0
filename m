Thanks for the sharing, this patchset can not help the [1] case, since it's just relief the per container lock contention now. Yes, readtwice case could be more sensitive for this lru_lock changes in containers. I may try to use it in container with some tuning. But anyway, aim9 is also pretty good to show the problem and solutions. :)

We repeatly create or delete a lot of different containers according to servers load/usage, so normal workload could cause lots of pages alloc/remove. aim9 could reflect part of scenarios. I don't know the DB scenario yet.

the Setddev/CoeffVar case has about 50% performance increase. one of container's mmtests result as following:

Stddev    page_test      245.15 (   0.00%)      189.29 (  22.79%)
Stddev    brk_test      1258.60 (   0.00%)      629.16 (  50.01%)
CoeffVar  page_test        0.71 (   0.00%)        0.53 (  26.05%)
CoeffVar  brk_test         1.32 (   0.00%)        0.64 (  51.14%)
