Ulf,

Sorry to be a bother... Is anything remaining for this work to make
it into a second PR for 5.4 before the merge window closes?

It would be really convenient for the microsd readers in
current-generation thinkpads (for instance) to have hardware support out
of the box without having to wait another kernel release cycle, if
there's nothing otherwise remaining to change.  I confirmed that
it currently applies cleanly on top of Linus's kernel.

Thanks
