Hi Srinivas,

The properties can be handled at two levels.

First, you'd want to change include/linux/soundwire/sdw.h, and add a new 
field in

struct sdw_dpn_prop {
	u32 num;
	u32 max_word;
	u32 min_word;
	u32 num_words;
	u32 *words;
+       bool read_only_wordlength;

Once this is added, along with the code that bypasses the programming of 
DPn_BlockCtrl1, the implementation has two choices:

a) hard-code the field value in the codec driver.

b) read the property from firmware with the DisCo helpers.

There is no requirement that all properties be read from firmware, and 
if you look at existing code base sdw_slave_read_prop() is currently 
unused, each codec implements its own .read_prop() callback.

We really wanted to be pragmatic, and give the possibility to either 
override bad firmware or extend incomplete firmware to avoid coupling OS 
and firmware too much. If you foresee cases where this implementation 
might vary and firmware distribution is not a problem, then a property 
read would make sense.

Just once procedural reminder that all 'mipi-sdw' properties are handled 
by the MIPI software WG, so we'd need to have this property added in a 
formal MIPI document update.

I suggest you talk with Lior first on this.

Hope this helps
-Pierre
