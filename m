Attention

I am Mr. Atif Elkadi the Deputy Executive Director, Ontario
International Airport California USA. During our recent inspection a
package containing an ATM card value the sum of $6.5 Million was
found. However, I find out that  the package was abandoned because the
Contents of the packager was not properly declared ATM card, rather it
was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shipping
Agent, and also due to inability for delivery agent  to summit the sum
of $395.00 charged for GIS clearance permit certificate requested  by
the GIS investigation agency made your package to still be hold in our
custody till this moment.

However, I will advise you to provide your current address and Phone
Number if any change has been made, to avoid wrong delivery. Please
note that we have made arrangement to release your ATM card worth $6.5
Million to you immediately you provide all the necessary requirements
for the delivery of your ATM card, and remit the sum of $395.00
charged for GIS clearance certificate permit fee of your ATM card.

Thanks

Mr. Atif Elkadi
Deputy Executive Director,
