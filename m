The pre() and post() functions you have referenced above including the 
check for the flag are executed with the mutex held.

Please see Mimi's response to the v3 email. I have copied it below:

************************************
Reading the flag IS lock protected, just spread across two functions.
For performance, ima_post_key_create_or_update() checks
ima_process_keys, before calling ima_queue_key(), which takes the
mutex before checking ima_process_keys again.

As long as both the reader and writer, take the mutex before checking
the flag, the locking is fine.  The additional check, before taking
the mutex, is simply for performance.
************************************

The flag is checked with the mutex held in the "reader" - 
ima_queue_key(). The key is queued with the mutex held only if the flag 
is false.

The flag is protected in the "writer" also - ima_process_queued_keys(). 
The flag is checked with the mutex held, set to true, and queued keys 
(if any) are transferred to the temp list.

As Mimi has pointed out the additional check of the flag, before taking 
the mutex in ima_post_key_create_or_update() and in 
ima_process_queued_keys(), is for performance reason.

If the flag is true, there is no need to take the mutex to check it 
again in those functions.

thanks,
