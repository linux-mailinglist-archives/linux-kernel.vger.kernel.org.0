Right.

It should be clear why this is necessary when reading

Because of the following race condition which is open after

"[patch 2/3] timers: do not raise softirq unconditionally (spinlockless
version)": 


CPU-0				CPU-1

				jiffies=99
runs
add_timer_on, with 
timer->expires=100
				jiffies=100
				run_softirq(), sees pending bitmap clear

add_timer_on 
returns and 
timer was not executed

P)


This race did not exist before. 

So by raising a softirq on the remote CPU 
at point P), its ensured the timer will 
be executed ASAP.
