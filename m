Thank you for your time to share the best practices from the heart of
Linux kernel community. This looks like a reasonable blueprint to follow
and I will personally bookmark and quote it whenever appropriate.

The way I see "Originally-by" is that it attempts to replace the free
wording implied at #3 (i.e. patch rewrite case) and hence its benefit.

The less words I have to creatively write by myself, the less errors
I'll make, the less ambiguous my patch will be, the more time I'll have
to dedicate to the important parts of the patch description (feature
overview, bug reproduction, test scenario, etc).

I also understand the desire not to make the process more complicated
than it needs to be. I expect the signature to still pop up here and
there and whether it makes sense to whitelist it, time will tell.
