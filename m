There aren't too many changes between 5.0.7 and 5.0.8 that touch
PCI/ACPI. This is just a shot in the dark but could you try to revert:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable-rc.git/commit/?h=linux-5.0.y&id=da6a87fb0ad43ae811519d2e0aa325c7f792b13a

and see if it makes any difference?
