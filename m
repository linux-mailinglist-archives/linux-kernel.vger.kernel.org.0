But the cmdline (bootargs) is already supported, I think this is a kind of bootargs.

Tracing is not only debugging the kernel drivers, but also measures
performance or behavior and compare with different settings.
Also, in some case, we can not change the binary, like distro kernel.

Yeah, devicetree build time may not be matter, decoupling from the
kernel image is, I think, the key point.
