I must admit I fail to understand what that extra node would be good for.
Logically, the eDP far side is connected to the well-known n116bge.
Inside the laptop case it might as well be a flat ribbon cable or
soldered directly.
In good intention, that's all I wanted to express in the DT. I don't
know whether the relevant mechanical dimensions of the panel and the
connector are standardised, so whether one could in theory assemble it
with a different panel than the one it came with.

OTOH, as I checked during the discussion with anarsoul, the panel's
supply voltage is permanently connected to the main 3.3V rail.
We already agreed that the eDP output port must not neccessarily be
specified, this setup is a good example why: because the panel is
always powered, the anx6345 can always pull valid EDID data from it
so at this stage there's no need for any OS driver to reach beyond
the bridge. IIRC even the backlight got switched off for the blank
screen without.

All I wanted to say is that "there's usually an n116bge behind it";
but this is mostly redundant.

So, shall we just drop the output port specification (along with the
panel node) in order to get one step further?

Well, as I wrote: "in good intention". That's the panel that comes with
the kit but it is very well detected automatically, just like you describe.

So, just leave it out?
