Thanks, will publish the fixes on v3.

Cascading is used for control path events. For data path the HW is not 
cascaded (and usually even configured in MSI-X instead of wire interrupts)

FIC only support two sensing modes, rising-edge and level.

Indeed we use interrupt specifier that has the level type in it 
(dt-binding: "#interrupt-cells: must be 2.") which in turns causes to 
this irq_set_type callback.

Part of the FICs are connected to hws that generate pulse (for those, 
FIC shall be configured to rising-edge-triggered) and the others to hws 
that keep the line up (for those the FIC shall be configured to 
level-triggered).

Those error messages are control path messages. if we return the same 
error value from here and from the previous error, how can we 
differentiate between the two error cases by looking at the log?

Having informative printouts seems like a good idea for bad 
configuration cases as such, wouldn't you agree?
