I think we should drop the syscon compatible for LGM then
even for the legacy SoCs the reset controller should not have a syscon
compatible: instead it should have a syscon parent (as the current
"lantiq,xrx200-reset" binding requires and as suggested by Rob for
another IP block: [0])

keeping regmap is great in my opinion because it's a nice API and gets
rid of some boilerplate
even better if it makes things easier for accessing the secure processor

just so I know how the documentation looks like:
does the hardware spec document 8 registers, each with (up to) the 32
reset lines in it?

reset-meson.c does it like that, but the difference there is that the
reset registers are continuous because there's no status register in
between
so your existing way of describing the reset line seems fine if Rob is
happy with it as well

OK, let me summarize what we have so far.

all SoC have the following "shared" logic so far:
- all reset_control_ops callbacks are the same on VRX200 and LGM
(assuming we fix the issues you found in the reset-lantiq.c
implementation)
- internally we should use regmap (LGM for accessing the secure
processor, earlier SoCs because the parent is a syscon)
- each reset line consists of a reset register offset and bit as well
as a status register offset and bit

however, we have differences in:
- how to map the registers (LGM maps the RCU registers directly while
earlier SoCs fetch the parent syscon)
- calculation of the status register
- calculation of the status bit

I see two ways to use one common driver for LGM and the earlier SoCs:

1) use a reset line mapping table as for example reset-imx7.c does.
this would include reset register, reset bit, status register and status bit.
LGM can use a macro to get rid of the duplication between status bit
and reset bit (and the status register offset if you prefer)
this case would use #reset-cells = <1> and we wouldn't need to
implement the of_xlate callback

2) on VRX200 (and probably the older SoCs as well) we can encode the
following information in one 32-bit value:
- reset register (max value: 0x48)
- status register (max value: 0x24)
- reset bit (max value: 32)
- status bit (max value: 32)

if this also works for LGM we can determine all required information
for a reset line in the of_xlate callback and translate it to one
32-bit value.
LGM and earlier SoCs would each use it's own of_xlate implementation.
the reset_control_ops callback would then unpack the 32-bit value
("unsigned long id") into the reset register and bit as well as status
register and bit (as needed)

both ways can work, but it depends on what the dt-bindings maintainers
(like Rob) think of the binding itself.
(dt-bindings follow what the hardware implements, the driver only does
the translation between a vendor specific binding and a given
subsystem)
so we first need Rob's ACK on the binding, then we can figure out the
best driver implementation for that binding
