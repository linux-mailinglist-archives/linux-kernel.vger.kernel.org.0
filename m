If I don't get it wrong, it should not	 be dropped here. Like your words,
"mtd_is_bitflip() does not mean that you are reading a false buffer,
but that the data has been corrected as it contained bitflips.", the
data I get are valid even if mtd_is_bitflip() return true. It's correct
data and it's no need to go to handle error. To me, the codes
should be:
	if (ret < 0 && !mit_is_bitflip())
		[error handling]

Do you mean that mtdpstore should enforce this alignment while running?
The way I can think of is to handle a buffer aligned to writesize and
write to flash with this aligned buffer.

That causes some error. The MTD device will be divided into mutil
chunks accroding to dmesg_size. Each chunk stores a individual
OOPS/Panic log. If dmesg_size is misaligned to writesize, the last
write results in next write failure because the page of flash can only
be programed once before next erase and the page shared by two chunks
has been used by the last write. Besides, we can not read to buffer,
ersae and write back as there is no read/erase for panic case.

To me, it's unnecessary to check at all, however it is really there
on codes of mtdoops. I refer to module mtdoops when I design mtdpstore.
It may be helpfull for some cases out of my think, that's why I keep it.

This function will be called only when mtd device is removing. It's
useless to alert the user but try to flush the other valid data to
flash as mush as possible by which reduce losses. If it's just
because of busy, what happens next time?
