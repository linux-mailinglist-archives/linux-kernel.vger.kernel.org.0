This is actually a behavior change. Today's udelay() will continue
after processing the interrupt. Your patches don't

I don't think it's a problem though. The interrupt will cause
a long enough delay that exceed any reasonable udelay() requirements.

There would be a difference if someone did really long udelay()s, much
longer than typical interrupts, in this case you might end up
with a truncated udelay, but such long udelays are not something that we
would encourage.

I don't think you need to change anything in the code, but should
probably document this behavior.
