I like this, but:

I think you answered your question of why firmware is loaded from the
namespace of systemd-udevd at times, it happens due to a module being
asked to be loaded which then called out and asked for firmware as part
of its probe process.

Now saying that the firmware load namespace is going to be tied always
to the modprobe namespace is problematic, as we can't guarantee that
will always happen for all bus and driver types.

So resetting this all back to the init namespace seems to make sense to
me, and odds are it will not break anything.

But, as you are adding a new firmware feature, any chance you can write
an additional test to the firmware self-tests so that we can verify that
this really is working the way you are saying it does, so we can trust
it and verify it doesn't break in the future?

thanks,
