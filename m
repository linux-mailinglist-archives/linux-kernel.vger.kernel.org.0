Indeed.  If add_timer_on() should always be used when with pinned
timers, IMHO it would be good to comment probably above TIMER_PINNED
about the fact so people will never misuse the interfaces (it seems to
be mis-used somehow but I cannot be 100% sure, please see below).

Purely for curiousity - why would we like to use current cpu base even
if it's unpinned?  My humble opinion is that if we use base directly
at least we can avoid potential migration of the timer.  But I can be
missing some real reason here...

It's not a lot of places that used TIMER_PINNED so I gave a quick look
on it.  Two conditions are always correct:

- when add_timer_on is used as explained, or,

- when timer_setup(..., TIMER_PINNED) is used in the same context as
  timer_mod() (e.g., mod_timer is called right after timer_setup).

For above two cases, the timer will always be running with expected
CPU that was pinned.

Though, I see two outliers:

======================

*** drivers/cpufreq/powernv-cpufreq.c:
powernv_cpufreq_cpu_init[867]  TIMER_PINNED | TIMER_DEFERRABLE);

*** net/ipv4/inet_timewait_sock.c:
inet_twsk_alloc[189]           timer_setup(&tw->tw_timer, tw_timer_handler, TIMER_PINNED);

======================

For the first one I can't say it's problematic since even if it's not
pinned correctly it has the logic to re-pin the timer so it'll finally
be fine:

void gpstate_timer_handler(struct timer_list *t)
{
        ...
	/*
	 * If the timer has migrated to the different cpu then bring
	 * it back to one of the policy->cpus
	 */
	if (!cpumask_test_cpu(raw_smp_processor_id(), policy->cpus)) {
		gpstates->timer.expires = jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(1);
		add_timer_on(&gpstates->timer, cpumask_first(policy->cpus));
		spin_unlock(&gpstates->gpstate_lock);
		return;
	}
        ...
}

For the other one, the timer is setup during inet_twsk_alloc(), but
the mod_timer() is in __inet_twsk_schedule() which seems to be
problematic.
