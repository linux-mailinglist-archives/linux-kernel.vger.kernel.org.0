I don't remember the original discussion either, but in retrospect that=20
does seem much simpler--especially since hte client is conditioning=20
sending this based on the the require_osd_release.  It seems like passing=
=20
a flag to the copy-from op would be more reasonable instead of conditional=
=20
feature-based behavior.
