Thanks for the clarification. This is an even better explanation. 

Fwiw, I ran some of my cfs throttling tests with this, none of which are
designed to measure or hit this particular issue. They are more focused
on starvation and hard lockups that I've hit. But I did not see any issues
or oddities with this patch. 

Cheers,
Phil
