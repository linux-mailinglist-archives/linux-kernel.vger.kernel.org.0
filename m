I am new to yaml, is there a way to say the number of entries here must
match arm,num-chans ? And not sure if min/maxItems matter then ?

Why is arm,func-ids optional ? Is there any standard arm,func-ids we can
resort to. Sorry I know you expect ARM Ltd to answer that, but I just want
to raise the point that we don't have one today and hence it can't be
optional. Or I am missing something ?
