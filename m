AFAICS some abstraction is needed to carry on the needed stuff
like mmaps, counts, group links, PMU details (type, cpus..)

well, besides that we wanted to do this separation for tools/* sake,
I think that once libperf shares more interface on sampling and pmu
events parsing, it will be considerable choice also for out of the
tree tools

yea, as I wrote in the perf_evsel__open patch changelog:

  It's a simplified version of evsel__open without fallback
  stuff. We can try to merge it in the future to libperf,
  but it has many glitches.

some of the API can be shared right away, some needs more
changes and consideration
