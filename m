Ok, thanks for confirming.

Yeah, those AOSP commits doesn't make much sense, especially not the
first one since it doesn't provide any means to define the client.

I spent some time looking into this today, and this doesn't seem to be
an issue for mainline unless we are reloading 8250 drivers.

Specifically, the statically defined ports that 8250 core would register
when an 8250 driver is being unbound could end up with a NULL client
ops.

This is seems unlikely to be an issue in practice, but I think we should
plug this nonetheless.

I already fixed the related issue of serdev not resetting the client_ops
on failed registration in aee5da783878 ("serdev: fix tty-port client
deregistration"), and I think the unregistration case should be handled
similarly by the serdev ttyport controller driver (rather than by tty
core).

I've prepared a patch with a commit message outlining how this may
affect mainline and included a stable tag. This should fix the issue in
AOSP as well, even that first commit [1] above really should be
reverted.
