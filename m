We are talking about two things.

First thing is about whether we should automatically add KERN_UNSUPPRESSED
to all printks down the op_p->handler() line. I initially thought that we
should automatically add KERN_UNSUPPRESSED, but I realized that we should
not do it. I want to allow users to configure not to show all messages
on the console when syslog is enough.

Right. Some distributions do the opposite thing in order to speed up
the boot sequence; increase console_loglevel to hide most of messages
on the console by default. We can trigger "SysRq-9" -> "SysRq-t" ->
"SysRq-4" from keyboard in order to print all SysRq-t messages to
the consoles when we need to do.

Since vkdb_printf() uses CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL_SILENT, KERN_UNSUPPRESSED alone
is not sufficient for avoid playing with console loglevel for tree wide.
If we want to get rid of temporary manipulation of console loglevel for
only SysRq, introducing KERN_UNSUPPRESSED would be OK. But we want to get
rid of temporary manipulation of console loglevel for tree wide, don't we?
If yes, I think that we will need per context "always print to consoles" /
"never print to consoles" / "print to consoles based on console loglevel"
control, for explicitly passing that control to foo()->dump_stack()->printk()
will be (not impossible but) a huge change.

Second thing is about whether we can defer console_unlock() from specific
callers.

What I suggest is to enforce "never deferred" on e.g. SysRq-h and enforce
"always deferred" on e.g. SysRq-t. Since console_unlock() enforces flushing
of printk() buffer, users can trigger "SysRq-t" -> "SysRq-h" when SysRq-t
failed to flush printk() buffer.

Is this about only SysRq messages? Or any printk() messages?
If this is about SysRq messages, I don't think "always defer" is
possible. We need a way to force flushing of printk() buffer when
"always deferred" SysRq messages did not get printed to consoles.

Which patch does "Sergey's patchsets adding the offload logic into
console_unlock()" refer to? As far as I am aware, any attempt to
"almost always" offload to a in_task() context will be unlikely
accepted (like Andrew Morton worried at
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20160404155149.a3e3307def2d1315e2099c63@linux-foundation.org ).
I'm not expecting that we can define the limit appropriately, for
the amount of data which needs to be printed on to console is
unpredictable.

My should_defer_output() attempt offloads only when the caller is willing
to defer console_unlock(). oom_kill_process() and warn_alloc() would
generate less amount of data than SysRq-t, but these callers cannot make
forward progress until printk() returns. Thus, should_defer_output() helps
avoiding stalls at at least oom_kill_process() and warn_alloc() because
deferred printk() allows __ratelimit() based on e.g. frequency, amount of
data which is waiting for being printed to consoles. And per context
"defer printing to consoles if oops is not in progress but the caller is
willing to defer printing to consoles" control should be viable.
