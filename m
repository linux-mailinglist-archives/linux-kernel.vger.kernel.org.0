Ah, right.  In the previous version of the patch it was a problem
because you flushed in cache_rpm_request() and then clobbered it right
away in __rpmh_write() when you did rpmh_rsc_send_data().  With v13
that is not the case anymore.  So this case should be OK.

I guess we'd have to confirm that there's no way for the cache to
_not_ become dirty but you do an "active" transaction.  Let's imagine
this case:

start transaction
rpmh_write(RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x99);
rpmh_write(RPMH_SLEEP_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x11);
rpmh_write(RPMH_WAKE_ONLY_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x99);
end transaction

start transaction
rpmh_write(RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x99);
rpmh_write(RPMH_SLEEP_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x11);
rpmh_write(RPMH_WAKE_ONLY_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x99);
end transaction

In other words the client does the same sequence twice in a row with
no change in data.  After the first set I think you'd be fine.  ...but
after the second set you'll be in trouble.  That's because none of the
calls in the second set would cause the "dirty" to be set.  ...but for
"active only" calls we don't have any sort of cache--we just fire it
off.  When we fire off the active only we'll clobber the sleep/wake
TCS.  ...and then nothing will write them again because the cache
isn't dirty.

Ah, interesting.  I still think you have problems I pointed out in
another response because you never enable interrupts for the "WAKE
TCS", but I can see how this could be made to work.  In this case
"async" becomes a little silly here because the flush will essentially
be forced to wait until the transaction is totally done (so the TCS is
free again), but it should be able to work.  This might actually point
out something that needs to be changed in my "clean up" series since I
guess "tcs_in_use" could sometimes be present in a wake TCS now.

I don't really understand, but maybe it'll be obvious when I see the code.

Yes, but it will catch buggy clients much more quickly.  What are the downs=

Right, I want to warn on underflow.  AKA:

WARN_ON(!ctrlr->active_clients);
ctrlr->active_clients--;

Generally it's handy to detect mismatches of start/end.  It could be
that someone accidentally starts twice and ends once.  Starts zero
times and ends once.  Starts once and ends twice.  All of these are
interesting cases to warn about.
