Right.

If something needs special mockery and is not generic, I'd just
come up with whatever string PWM needs, like
"pwm-idle", "pwm-sleep", "pwm-init" etc instead of
complicating the stuff done before probe(). These states are
only handled there to make probe() simple in simple cases.

I think Paul hashed it out. Or will.

I would say the driver can come up with whatever state it need for
that and handle it explicitly. When there are so many of them that
it warrants growing the device core, we can move it into
drivers/base/pinctrl.c. But no upfront design.

I would suggest doing that.

The helpers are just for the dirt-simple cases anyway.
At one point one developer thought that the "default" set up
before probe would be the only thing any system would ever
want to do with pin control. It seems like not.
