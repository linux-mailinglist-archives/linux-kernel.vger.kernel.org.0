Oh, yes - that actually is the right thing to do here.  If you already
have it please just send it out.

->dma_mask is a complete mess.  It is a pointer when it really should
just be a u64, and that means every driver layer has to allocate space
for it.  We don't really do that for platform_devices, as that breaks
horribly assumptions in the usb code.  That is why
dma_coerce_mask_and_coherent exists as a nasty workaround that sets
the dma_mask to the coherent_dma_mask for devices that don't have
space for ->dma_mask allocated, which works as long as the device
doesn't have differnet addressing requirements for both.

I'm actually working to fix that mess up at the moment, but it is going
to take a few cycles until everything falls into place.
