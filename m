I have not seen one happened before except the NUMA_NO_NODE case.
Even with NUMA_NO_NODE case, we did not see it until we turn on
the KASAN detection.

It seems that there is no protection that prevent setting the node
of device to an invalid node.
And the kernel does have a few different check now:
1) some does " < 0" check;
2) some does "== NUMA_NO_NODE" check;
3) some does ">= MAX_NUMNODES" check;
4) some does "< 0 || >= MAX_NUMNODES || !node_online(node)" check.

We need to be consistent about the checking, right?
