Shiping, you also need to address the binding comment here.

If Lei is coming back soon then it may be best to wait for her?

submitting patches in the source tree:
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.

Also, some of your other coworkers must know how to upstream code and 
can help you follow the process?
