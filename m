Sounds a little long yes.  And doesn't fix the additional problem that
we don't just it for mmap but also for the in-kernel remapping these
days.

I've sent a ping to the mips folks.  While we'are at it:  arm64
and arm32 (optionally) map dma coherent allocations as write combine.
I suspect this hasn't always just been busted but intentional (of course!),
but is there any chance to get a quote from the arm architecture spec
on why this is fine as it looks rather confusion?

Also if we assume mips is buggy DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE really just seems
to be there for old arm platforms, which makes the scope pretty limited.
