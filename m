I spent a little time thinking about that during the recent round of
reviews.

My rough thoughts were that LED triggers would be a good way to
handle it in the kernel code and would trivially solve a backlight
composed of multiple LED devices (since all could attach to the same
trigger). However I think it would be difficult to use the existing DT
bindings for triggers to express things like brightness curves and to
handle systems with multiple heads.

I'm not *too* worried about conflict with the existing backlight trigger
(which isn't actually a backlight... just a hook into the framebuffer
code to operate a binary LED). People like Daniel Vetter are
labouring diligently to get rid of the notifier it depends on so turning
it into a proper backlight device would probably help with that effort.

Anyhow... having thought the above I then shook myself a bit and
figured it was more important to focus on sane bindings that on what
the kernel does under the covers to realize them ;-) and decided to keep
quiet until the next set of bindings is proposed.

However... since you asked...



Daniel.
