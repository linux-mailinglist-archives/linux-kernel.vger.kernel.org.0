So nor HMM nor driver should dereference the struct page (i do not
think any iommu driver would either), they only care about the pfn.
So even if we race with a teardown as soon as we get the mmu notifier
callback to invalidate the mmapping we will do so. The pattern is:

    mydriver_populate_vaddr_range(start, end) {
        hmm_range_register(range, start, end)
    again:
        ret = hmm_range_fault(start, end)
        if (ret < 0)
            return ret;

        take_driver_page_table_lock();
        if (range.valid) {
            populate_device_page_table();
            release_driver_page_table_lock();
        } else {
            release_driver_page_table_lock();
            goto again;
        }
    }

The mmu notifier callback do use the same page table lock and we
also have the range tracking going on. So either we populate
device page table before racing with teardown in which case the
device page table entry are clear through the mmu notifier call
back. Or if we race, but then we can see the racing mmu notifier
calls and retry again which will trigger a regular page fault
which will return an error i assume.

So in the end we have the exact same behavior as if a CPU was trying
to access that virtual address. This is the whole point of HMM, to
behave exactly as if it was a CPU access. Fails in the same way,
race in the same way. So if DAX teardown are safe versus racing
CPU access to some vma that have that memory map, it will be the
same for HMM users.


GPU driver test suite are not good at testing this. They are geared
to test the GPU itself not the interaction of the GPU driver with
rest of the kernel.
