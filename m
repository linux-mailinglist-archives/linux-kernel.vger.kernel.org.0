I've been going through the various codepaths and that change should be
fine. The places I looked at that worried me were release_task(),
reparent_leader(), wait_consider_task() and their callers.
But all of these either take read_lock(&tasklist_lock) or
write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock) themselves or are called with them held,
same for ptrace_attach() and ptrace_detach(). And the whole sequence
that switches to autoreaping when the parent ingores SIGCHLD in
do_notify_parent() and wait_task_zombie() is under
write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock) as well so setting it to EXIT_ZOMBIE
before do_notify_parent() and switching it to EXIT_DEAD when the parent
ignores SIGCHLD should be safe.
If we missed a sublety then we'll know pretty soon I'm sure.

I'll pick this up now. We'll have some time anyway.

wake_up_all() which is used in do_notify_pidfd() implies a general
memory barrier if something is actually woken up.

> and waiting implies acquire barrier AFAIU. I am still not fully sure though,

poll_wait() when used with eventpoll hits add_wait_queue which takes
spin_lock_irqsave() which implies an acquire barrier if I remember
memory_barriers right.

I didn't see it as an issue either.
