I'd vote for 1 (duh) but won't fight for it, if it comes to it I'd be
happy with a random draw :D

As I said in the original thread by Subhra, this range should be plenty
enough IMO. You get ~5% deltas in each direction after all.

IIUC you're describing a scenario where we fail to find an idle core due to
a wakee being latency-sensitive (thus shorter scan), and place it on a rq
that already has runnable tasks (despite idle rqs being available).

In this case yes, we could potentially have a balance attempt trying to pull
from that rq. We'd try to pull the non-running tasks first, and if a
latency-sensitive task happens to be one of them we should be careful with
what we do - a migration could lead to unwanted latency.

It might be a bit more clear when you're balancing between busy cores - 
overall I think you should try to migrate the non-latency-sensitive
tasks first. Playing with task_hot() could be one of the ways to do that, but
it's just a suggestion at this time.
