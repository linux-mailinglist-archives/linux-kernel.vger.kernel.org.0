Something like that.  There is no really satisfying way for doing huge
inline asm, and maybe that is a good thing ;-)

Often people write \n\t at the end of each line of inline asm.  This works
pretty well (but then there are labels, oh joy).

That is what + means, yes -- that this output is an input as well.  It is
the same to write

  asm("mov %1,%0 ; mov %0,42" : "+r"(x), "=r"(y));
or to write
  asm("mov %1,%0 ; mov %0,42" : "=r"(x), "=r"(y) : "0"(x));

(So not "at the same time" as in "in the same machine instruction", but
more loosely, as in "in the same inline asm statement").

> "to be made earlyclobbers", what does this means exactly ? How to do that ?

You write &, like "+&r" in this case.  It means the machine code writes
to this register before it has consumed all asm inputs (remember, GCC
does not understand (or even parse!) the assembler string).

So just

		: "+&r" (loop1), "+&r" (loop2)

will do.  (Why are they separate though?  It could just be one loop var).
