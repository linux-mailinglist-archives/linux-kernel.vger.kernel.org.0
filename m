This is a relic of a too quick copy from marvell_nand.c. Please match
the structure with your controller memory layout instead.

What Helmut proposes is, I think, saving the clock frequency to avoid
requesting it everytime you want to use it (if this is done many times).

I did not check diskonchip.c's implementation but turning it into const
seems reasonable to me. However in the scope of this driver, Naga, you
can keep it as it is right now.

This answer is scary, there are probably many other places where you
deleted useful code then?

Also, you probably don't need addr5 and addr6 here, they were needed in
marvell_nand.c because addresses are stored in three different
registers and are limited to 6 cycles, but this is probably not the
case in your driver.

Yes please, be careful and not in a hurry when re-posting, it already
takes quite some time to review the entire driver.
