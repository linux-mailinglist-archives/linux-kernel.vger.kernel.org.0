In my case performance is 2nd place to a transfer not getting
interrupted once started (so we don't break the 8ms rule of the EC).
My solution in v2 of my series is to take out the forcing in the case
that the controller wanted "rt" priority and then to add "force" to
the parameter name.  If someone wants rt priority for the thread but
doesn't want to force all transfers to the thread we can later add a
different parameter for that?
