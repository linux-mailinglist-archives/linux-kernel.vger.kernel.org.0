actually I would really do it like this:

	1) read params
	2) overwrite values from DT
	2) write params (if transport mode is different)

The advantage with this is that when you have to debug things, then the btmon trace will contain the default values the firmware has. So it is in all trace files all the time. We do that with other parameters as for exactly that reason.

That also means you can drop has_pcm_params variable.

Marcel
