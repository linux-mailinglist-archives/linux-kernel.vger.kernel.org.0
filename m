On our Colibri iMX6ULL board there is a circuit for switching the
power supply of the ethernet PHY with the 50MHz RMII clock.

This works quite fine but has one big problem. It is quite slow when
switching the supply, so Linux has to wait there. I think this switch
is at best represented as a fixed-regulator. In that way I can use
"startup-delay-us" to represent slow switching regulator.

But there's no current possibility to enable fixed-regulator with a
clock. In this RFC I send a patch after we would be able to add a clock
to a fixed-regulator in devicetree and then add the "startup-delay-us"
which would solve all my problems relatively elegant.
This works also the other way, if the PHY now needs power the
clock is not powered off because regulator depends on it.

Because this would need to change code in regulator core I like to
ask for your oppinion first, or if anyone has another idea how
I could solve that problem.

Thanks in advance for your feedback!

Philippe
