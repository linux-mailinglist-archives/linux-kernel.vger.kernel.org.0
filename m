OK.

Cool.

I'll try and revise that as I post the patch, probably at some point
between now and Christmas. I still think we should find a way to
address this for the D05 SAS driver though, maybe by managing the
affinity yourself in the driver. But this requires experimentation.

I've also managed to trigger some of them now that I have access to
a decent box with nvme storage. Out of curiosity, have you tried
with the SMMU disabled? I'm wondering whether we hit some livelock
condition on unmapping buffers...

Yup, much appreciated!

Thanks,
