If my understanding is correct, split_huge_page() succeeds the THP would be
tear down to normal page.

Function hwpoison_user_mappings() just handle user space mapping. If my
understanding is correct, we just have three type of pages would be used in
user space mapping:

    * normal page
    * THP
    * hugetlb

Since THP would be split or already returned and hugetlb is handled in another
branch, this means for other pages hwpoison_user_mappings() would just return
true.
