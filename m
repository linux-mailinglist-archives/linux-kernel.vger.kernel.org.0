Subject: Will RMS be back to Programming now?

I was wondering; will RMS be back to programming now, for the gnu 
system, and other things perhaps?
I think all us hackers missed him. People kept saying "he doesn't 
program anymore, what has he done lately" etc.
Will he do it now? And at an ever increasing clip?

I totally relate to everything he says on the talks he's given (I've 
been hacking free-software videogames for almost 2 decades now, plus 
system software and all that)... I only recently really begun to read 
his ideas (I knew the free software points, but to read the history he 
gives of everything) and watch the videos.

The video in Putins Russia this year was very good; you should put that 
on the GNU page, also the biography video he did this year also was 
spectacular. Together they really explain everything from top to bottom, 
and concisely.

So, will RMS be /back/ after a decade(s) or so on the road now? Back 
with his hacker friends he's created?
