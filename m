Thanks for the explanation. I guess I'll wait for the other patches to
see how all fits together. In general I'm not keen on per-CPU variables
exposed to the rest of the kernel. For example, is it always read in a
non-preemptible context? I'd rather have an accessor function with the
corresponding WARN_ON_ONCE(preemptible()). This may come with the rest
of the patches.

As long as that's a realistic possibility (not just a theoretical one)
and the in-kernel code can handle such asymmetry, it's fine by me. This
could be another reason to never expose the AMU counters to user-space
or guests. You can control preemption in the kernel but can't run
user-space in a non-preemptible context.
