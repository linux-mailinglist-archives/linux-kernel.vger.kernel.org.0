Hi Alan,

I spend some time reading this, really helpful! Thanks.

Please see comments below:

I wonder whehter we could add an optional ->coe or ->fre between X and
the possibly empty sequence of cumul-fence, smiliar to the definition
of ->prop. This makes sense because if we have

	X ->coe X' (and X' in on CPU C)

, X must be already propagated to C before X' executed, according to our
operation model:

"... In particular, it must arrange for the store to be co-later than
(i.e., to overwrite) any other store to the same location which has
already propagated to CPU C."

In other words, we can define ->vis as:

	let vis =3D prop ; ((strong-fence ; [Marked] ; xbstar) | (xbstar & int))

, and for this document, reference the "prop" section in
explanation.txt. This could make the model simple (both for description
and explanation), and one better thing is that we won't need commit in
Paul's dev branch:
=09
	c683f2c807d2 "tools/memory-model: Fix data race detection for unordered st=
ore and load"

, and data race rules will look more symmetrical ;-)

Thoughts? Or am I missing something subtle here?
