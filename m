Can you provide an explicit example please? As the changelog mentions
it is the "low numbers" that is really interesting when debugging
fragmentation issues. Because we are running out of a respective migrate
type and it is interesting to see why and what compaction is doing etc.

Having more than 100k pages on the respective migrate type list is a
good sign that the migrate type is not in problems. Comparing multiple
migrate types with >100k pages doesn't really need a large precision
AFAIU.

Now, I do agree that some debugging tools might get confused by > in the
output but can we wait for reports and see whether anybody actually
cares? It is more likely that fixing one off debugging tools wouldn't be
a big deal.
