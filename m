I placed it just below the firmware-guide at the main index file.

I have split thoughts about moving the files to there, though. From
one side, it may fit better from the PoV of organizing the documentation.

=46rom other side, newcomers working with DT may expect looking at the
text files inside Documentation/devicetree/.

Maybe I could add an extra patch at the end of this series with the
move, adding a "RFC" on his title. This way, we can better discuss it,
and either merge the last one or not depending on the comments.

Yeah, that would make sense. I'm using get-maintainers script to
prepare the c/c list, as it is simply too much work to find the
right maintainers by hand, for every single patch.

I just noticed today that there's just *one entry* at MAINTAINERS
file for Documentation/devicetree, and that points to you:

	DOCUMENTATION
	M:	Jonathan Corbet <corbet@lwn.net>
	L:      linux-doc@vger.kernel.org
	S:	Maintained
	F:      Documentation/
	F:	scripts/documentation-file-ref-check
	F:	scripts/kernel-doc
	F:	scripts/sphinx-pre-install
	X:      Documentation/ABI/
	X:	Documentation/firmware-guide/acpi/
	X:	Documentation/devicetree/

So, perhaps we should add something like this to MAINTAINERS:

diff --git a/MAINTAINERS b/MAINTAINERS
