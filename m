Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] crypto: engine - support for parallel and batch requests
Date:   Tue,  4 Feb 2020 14:34:18 +0200

Added support for executing multiple, independent or not, requests
for crypto engine. This is based on a callback, can_enqueue_more, which
asks the driver if the hardware has free space, to enqueue a new request.
If hardware supports batch requests, crypto-engine can handle this use-case
through do_batch_requests callback.

Since, these new features, cannot be supported by all hardware,
the crypto-engine framework is backward compatible:
- by using the crypto_engine_alloc_init function, to initialize
crypto-engine, the new callbacks are NULL and the engine will work
as before these changes;
- to support only multiple requests, in parallel, the can_enqueue_more
callback must be implemented in driver. On crypto_pump_requests, if
can_enqueue_more callback returns true, a new request is send
to hardware, until there is no space and the callback returns false.
- to support batch requests, do_batch_requests callback must be
implemented in driver, to execute a batch of requests. The link
between the requests, is expected to be done in driver, in do_one_request().

Changes since V1:
- changed the name of can_enqueue_hardware callback to can_enqueue_more, and
the argument of this callback to crypto_engine structure (for cases when more
than ore crypto-engine is used).
- added a new patch with support for batch requests.

Changes since V0 (RFC):
- removed max_no_req and no_req, as the number of request that can be
processed in parallel;
- added a new callback, can_enqueue_more, to check whether the hardware
can process a new request.
