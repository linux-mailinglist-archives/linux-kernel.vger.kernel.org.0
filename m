Yes, another way to look at it is, for a given address space:
* PASID tags device-IOTLB (ATC) entries.
* ASID (here called archid) tags IOTLB entries.

They could have the same value, but it depends on the guest's allocation
policy which isn't in our control. With my PASID patches for SMMUv3,
they have different values. So we need both fields if we intend to
invalidate both ATC and IOTLB with a single call.

Thanks,
