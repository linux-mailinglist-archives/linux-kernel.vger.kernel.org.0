There is no point in caring about this, simply because if you look at
the 5 callsites on x86:

    - Three are debug stuff which handle the error return and do not care
      about whether its EBUSY or not

    - One is the boot time cpu onlining which ignores any error code on
      purpose because there are enough reasons why this can fail and we
      want at least get up to init.

    - The last one is the sysfs interface which you are tripping over.

We don't know whats the proper timeout for everyone. You picked one and
it fits your expectation, but its bound to break other peoples
expectations.

That's the exact reason why these kind of heuristics are bad and
horrible and should be avoided in general.

If you have that isolation thingies on the kernel command line there is
no point in doing the cpu up/down dance. It's not providing you anything
useful except steering interrupts away which you can do on the kernel
command line as well with 'irqaffinity=...'.
