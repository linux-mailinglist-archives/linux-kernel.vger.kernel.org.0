I'm still considering of post_init() in nand_scan_tail() for
MTD layer default call-back function replacement because
there would be more call-back functions need it.
i.e., 
MTD->_lock/_unlokc
MTD->_suspend/_resume
NTD->_point/_unpoint
...


actually, my patch series are including MTD->_locl/_unlock and 
MTD->_suspend/_resume. how do you think ?


thanks for your time & comments.
Mason
