Let me amend the above statement:
We have the H/W infrastructure for that in GOYA. In GAUDI (I don't
know if you saw the press release), we don't have it, as the use-case
of that asic (training) doesn't require multiple processes support.
Therefore, when I will upstream that ASIC code, I will have to always
prevent multiple processes from opening file descriptors at the same
time, due to the above security concerns.
