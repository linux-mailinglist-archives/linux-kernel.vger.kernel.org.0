Please do not do separate clean up patches.  The series that Greg has is
not ready for acceptance and I am going to ask him to revert it as we
work through the needed changes.

I suspect there will be at least two more versions of the series.  The
first is to get the patches I commented in good shape.  Then I will
look at the patches later in the series to see how they fit into the
big picture.

In the end, there should be one coherent patch series that implements
the feature.
