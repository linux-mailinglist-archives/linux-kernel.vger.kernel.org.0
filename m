And is that any different from where you would choose to "just" set a 
generic bypass flag?

If intel-iommu gets fully converted such that everyone using default 
domains is also using iommu-dma, that should be it as far as the generic 
DMA ops are concerned (ultimately we might even be able to do it in 
__iommu_attach_device() based on the domain type). Like I said, the hard 
part is deciding when to make *these* calls, but apparently intel-iommu 
can already do that.

Because the specific "slightly more complicated" currently used by the 
existing powerpc code will AFAICS continue to be needed only by the 
existing powerpc code, thus I don't see any benefit to cluttering up the 
common code with it today. You may as well just refactor powerpc to 
swizzle its own ops to obviate archdata.iommu_bypass, and delete a fair 
chunk of old code.

Robin.
