Not really. My understanding is whether 'mem=3D ' is for debugging or not,
it should only take effect during boot-time. Even though people add
'mem=3D ' for debugging only, they will have to reboot if they want to do
futher testing, e.g memory hotplug, or any other feature which makes use
of the memory hotplug mechanism to implement their functionality, like
ballon, or pmem.
