I doubt this approach will survive real-life.

I would recommend considering the following alternative for this tracing-rcu
flavor:

- For all CPUs which are not nohz_full:
  - Implement fast RCU read-side which only requires compiler barriers,
  - Use IPIs to each of those CPUs when doing a grace period.

- For all nohz_full CPUS:
  - Dynamically detect CPUs which are nohz_full,
  - Implement slower RCU read-side with memory barriers,
  - No need to issue any IPI to those CPUs when doing the grace period.

This should cover all use-cases: staying fast for the common case, without
disturbing RT workloads.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
