Will do! The previous comment that explained this was ".. while
ensuring max_freq is converted to HZ.", but I believed it as too
clear and replaced it with the obscure "(hz)". I'll revert :).

Okay, I'll add some of this documentation as comments in the patches. I
thought about doing it but I was not sure it justified the line count.
But if it saves people at least the hassle to unpack this computation to
understand the logic, it will be worth it.

Thank you for the thorough review,
Ionela.
