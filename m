Hi Matthew,
Thank you for your deep response.

I think XArray is a very well-made structure that requires no further
improvement if the indexes are dense in a 64-bit system.

Since xa_node is 576 bytes and is set to fit 7 per 4kB page,
adding a data type to xa_node is rather a memory waste problem.

#define XA_CHUNK_SHIFT          (CONFIG_BASE_SMALL ? 4 : 6)
XA_CHUNK_SIZE is 32 or 64

XA_CHUNK_SIZE is 32 or 64, and currently XAarray is 64 optimized,
so modifying it may have a counterproductive effect.

There is a downside to the well-designed XArray, but if the indexes
are not dense or deleted a lot, the memory of the slots in the xa_node
is increased and the search cost for logn increases at f (n) = O
(nlogn)

My worries are here and I hope you understand my efforts to solve it.

My attempts described below are meaningful when XA_CHUNK_SHIFT is 4 or
2, and can solve the slowdown in search speed when indexes are deleted
and not concentrated.

When XA_CHUNK_SHIFT is 2(XA_CHUNK_SIZE is 4), the XArray configuration
is as follows.
(It is difficult to express the picture in text.)

xarray->head : xa_node : index: 0  16  32  48
                +---+---+---+
                                |   |   |   |
        +-----------------------+   |   |   +------------+

    0  4  8  12    16  20  24  28   32  36  40  44   48  52  56  60
    +--+--+---+    +---+---+---+    +---+---+---+    +---+---+---+
        |              |                |                |
  +-----+              |                +-------+        +---------------+
  |                    |                        |                        |
  0 1 2 3 <==>... <==> 16 17 18 19 <==>... <==> 32 33 34 35 <==>...
<==> 48 49 ..

In the above, if xa_node is connected to next and prev, it does not
search the parent node, so the logn disappears from f (n) = O (nlogn),
which improves search efficiency with f (n) = O (n). In fact, this is
already well-known in traditional algorithms, but I hope you can
understand it with the effort applied to XArray.

Best Regards,
JaeJoon Jung.
