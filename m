The patch

   ASoC: rk3399_gru_sound: Support 32, 44.1 and 88.2 kHz sample rates

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.3

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: rk3399_gru_sound: Support 32, 44.1 and 88.2 kHz sample
 rates

According to the datasheet the max98357a also supports 32, 44.1 and
88.2 kHz sample rate. This support was also introduced recently by
commit fdf34366d324 ("ASoC: max98357a: add missing supported rates").

Actually the machine driver validates the supported sample rates but
this is not really needed because the component driver can all apply
whatever constraints are needed and do their own validation. So, remove
the checks from the machine driver as are not needed at all. This way,
we also support 32, 44.1 and 88.2 kHz sample rates and we get rid of the
errors like the below.

  rk3399-gru-sound sound: rockchip_sound_max98357a_hw_params() doesn't support this sample rate: 44100
  rk3399-gru-sound sound: ASoC: machine hw_params failed: -22
