I know. See below.

Well, yes. The sibling executes a limited set of instructions in a loop,
but it might be hit by an NMI or MCE which executes even more instructions.

So what happens if the ucode update "fixes" one of the executed
instructions on the fly? Is that guaranteed to be safe? There is nothing
which says so.

A decade ago I experimented with putting the spinning CPUs into MWAIT,
which caused havoc. Did neither have time nor the stomach to dig into that
further, but the ucode update _did_ fix an issue with MWAIT according to
the version history.

That's why I'm worried about instructions being "fixed" which are executed
in parallel on the sibling.

An authorative statement vs. that would be appreciated. Preferrably in form
of an extension of the SDM, but an upfront statement in this thread would
be a good start.

Thanks,
