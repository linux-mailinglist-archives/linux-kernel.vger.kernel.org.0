I have seen it many times. Its not at all difficult to get interrupt
assignments wrong, duplicated, or otherwise mistaken when creating
device trees. Not so much m68k/coldfire platforms where they are
most commonly hard coded.

I don't agree with the local variable part. Adding a local variable to
keep track of the error return code doesn't seem out of scope for this change.
The patch as Afzal sent it doesn't change the control flow - and
that is the right thing to do here.

Given the wide variety of message text used with failed request_irq() calls
it would be shear luck that this matched anything else. A quick grep shows
that "%s: request_irq() failed\n" has no other exact matches in the current
kernel source.
