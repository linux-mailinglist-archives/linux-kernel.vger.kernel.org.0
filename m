This is loaded with assumptions IMO. AFAICT we don't know what's the best
choice.

First, the value of uclamp.min is outside of the scope of this patch. Unless
what you're saying is that when uclamp.min is 1024 then we should NOT choose a
big cpu then there's no disagreement about what this patch do. If that's what
you're objecting to please be more specific about how do you see this working
instead.

If your objection is purely based on the choice of uclamp.min then while
I agree that on modern systems the little cores are good enough for the
majority of RT tasks in average Android systems. But I don't feel confident to
reach this conclusion on low end systems where the little core doesn't have
enough grunt in many cases. So I see the current default is adequate and the
responsibility of further tweaking lies within the hands of the system admin.
