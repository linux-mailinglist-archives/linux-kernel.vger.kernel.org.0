Hello, my name is Leo Holder; I work as an agent to a 
representative of a group of investors and lenders, so I 
contacted you in view of the unique opportunity that we could 
benefit from working together.  The investors and lenders have 
over$6.8 Billion portfolios and if you are seeking investment 
expansion (JV) or a loan arrangement, the group is reliable and 
has an exclusive range of a source of private investors and 
lenders for your business/projectâ€™s needs. They can invest in 
start-ups only if the investment proposal is logically realistic.  
The investor(s) wants to remain anonymous because of their 
current and previous position in the government. If you have 
serious interest to work with the group directly or recommend a 
company to take a private loan or investment funds from the 
investors and lenders, me and you will be entitled to 5% of any 
amount received by the company from the investors/or lenders, but 
if you are taking the fund directly as a company; I will be 
entitled to 2.5% as a commission fee. There will be a face to 
face meeting between the investor's fiduciary facilitators and 
the funding receiver after signing (MOU) the (ROI) should not be 
less than3% per annum if it's a loan or direct project financing. 
I will introduce you to the CEO representing investors/ lenders, 
the after receiving your project summary or that of the company 
seeking investment expansion (JV) funding or a loan arrangement.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Leo Holder.
