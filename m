Use the dependencies which are already there in DT. That's clocks,
pinctrl, regulators, interrupts, gpio at a minimum. I'm simply not
going to accept duplicating all those dependencies in DT. The downside
for the kernel is you have to address these one by one and can't have
a generic property the driver core code can parse. After that's in
place, then maybe we can consider handling any additional dependencies
not already captured in DT. Once all that is in place, we can probably
sort device and/or driver lists to optimize the probe order (maybe the
driver core already does that now?).

Get rid of the auto disabling of clocks and regulators in
late_initcall. It's simply not a valid marker that boot is done when
modules are involved. We probably can't get rid of it as lot's of
platforms rely on that, so it will have to be opt out. Make it the
platform's responsibility for ensuring a consistent state.

Perhaps we need a 'boot done' or 'stop deferring probe' trigger from
userspace in order to make progress if dependencies are missing. Or
maybe just some timeout would be sufficient. I think this is probably
more useful for development than in a shipping product. Even if you
could fallback to polling mode instead of interrupts for example, I
doubt you would want to in a product.

You should also keep in mind that everything needed for a console has
to be built in. Maybe Android can say the console isn't needed, but in
general we can't.
