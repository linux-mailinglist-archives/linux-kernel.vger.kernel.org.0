Also really the "Thor and Odin" style acidprophets we still see reflected i=
n people like Stallman is the big reggresion, and potentialiy block for gre=
ater economic flow, and should be replaced by intercultural thinking, takin=
g monotheistic developments, and going further to prosperity.

Oase is now Oase - Intercultural Operating System.

And I think I have solved all philosophical questions involved. So for all =
serious actors, acknowledge, and lets make it a big Fair Labour compliant C=
omputing Space.

Peace.
