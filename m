My understanding is that the actual CRC generation for normal symbols is
based purely on the string-representation of the function signature, and
so the underlying type information isn't relevant to that. I can also
confirm that the CRC for an exported symbol that returns a __uint128_t
is not the same if you change it to return a __int128_t instead.
