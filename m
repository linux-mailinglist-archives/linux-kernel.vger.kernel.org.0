[sending from my @chromium.org address so any appearance of bias is
explicit :) ]

Agree with Doug here, the naming and casting discussion is pretty
subjective and non-functional. We've got an Ack from Thierry and a
Review from Boris (both seasoned drm_panel'ers), this patch has been
sitting in review for a while. Let's not let the perfect be the enemy
of the good.
