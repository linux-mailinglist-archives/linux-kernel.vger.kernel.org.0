Yeah, definitely Kishon should be the one to land.  I was kinda hoping
to get confirmation from the Rockchip guys that this was a good idea
across the board for rk3288 since I can only really test
rk3288-veyron.  They'd have access to the SoC design and could tell
more about what this bit actually does in the SoC.

...in any case, if they don't respond then presumably we'd be good to
land once the merge window is over and Kishon is landing patches
again.
