Still don't understand how this is ok...

I have /dev/nvme0 represents a network endpoint that I would discover
from, it is raising me an event to do a discovery operation (namely to
issue an ioctl to it) so my udev code calls a systemd script.

By the time I actually get to do that, /dev/nvme0 represents now a new
network endpoint (where the event is no longer relevant to). I would
rather the discovery to explicitly fail than to give me something
different, so we pass some arguments that we verify in the operation.

Its a stretch case, but it was raised by people as a potential issue.
