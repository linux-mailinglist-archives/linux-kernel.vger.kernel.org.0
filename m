There are some cache objects which may be long-lived. In these kinds of cases, 
the cache objects aren't removed until they're conclusively not needed.

Since tmpfs shares the i_ino counter with every other user of get_next_ino, 
it's then entirely possible that we can thrash through 2^32 inodes within a 
period that it's possible for a single cache file to exist.

I didn't mention generation because, even though it's set on tmpfs (to 
prandom_u32()), it's not possible to evaluate it from userspace since `ioctl` 
returns ENOTTY. We can't ask userspace applications to introspect on an inode 
attribute that they can't even access :-)
