Can you point to an example in the kernel that actually uses ->cred this way?
I'm just curious. That is, reads task's ->cred pointer, and assigns it to an
RCU managed pointer?

I think such an example would be the point that the commit you mentioned
addresses. The commit basically says "as long as nobody does get_cred() on
the task_struct ->cred, we are good, but if somebody does do it, then we have
to deferred-free it".  But I could not find such an example.

That said, I agree the removal of non_rcu can be considered out of scope for
this patch.

thanks,
