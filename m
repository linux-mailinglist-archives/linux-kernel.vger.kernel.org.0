PS: the whole point of ->kill_sb() is that it's always called on
superblock destruction, whether that instance had been fully set
up of failed halfway through.

In particular, anything like foofs_fill_super() *will* be followed
by ->kill_sb().  Always.  Which allows for simpler logics in
failure exits.  And the main thing about those is that they are
always the bitrot hot spots - they are systematically undertested,
so that's the last place where you want something non-trivial.

As for "too much code between"...  Huh?  We fail jffs2_fill_super()
immediately, which has get_tree_mtd() (or mount_mtd() in slightly
earlier kernels) destroy the superblock there and then...
