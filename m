> This may seem odd to some at the first glance. But if you can think of how=
 static heap (pre-allocated by EADD before EINIT) works, the load parses the=
 "metadata" coming with the enclave to decide the address/size of the heap, E=
ADDs it, and calls it done. In the case of "dynamic" heap (allocated dynamic=
ally by EAUG after EINIT), the same thing applies - the loader determines th=
e range of the heap, tells the SGX module about it, and calls it done. Every=
thing else is the between the enclave and the SGX module.
>=20
> In practice, untrusted code usually doesn't know much about enclaves, just=
 like it doesn't know much about the shared objects loaded into its address s=
pace either. Without the necessary knowledge, untrusted code usually just do=
es what it is told (via o-calls, or return value from e-calls), without judg=
ing that's right or wrong.=20
>=20
> When it comes to #PF like what I described, of course a signal could be se=
nt to the untrusted code but what would it do then? Usually it'd just come b=
ack asking for a page at the fault address. So we figured it'd be more effic=
ient to just have the kernel EAUG at #PF.=20
>=20
> Please don't get me wrong though, as I'm not dictating what the s/w flow s=
hall be. It's just going to be a choice offered to user mode. And that choic=
e was planned to be offered via mprotect() - i.e. a writable vma causes kern=
el to EAUG while a non-writable vma will result in a signal (then the user m=
ode could decide whether to EAUG). The key point is flexibility - as we want=
 to allow all reasonable s/w flows instead of dictating one over others. We h=
ad similar discussions on vDSO API before. And I think you accepted my appro=
ach because of its flexibility. Am I right?

As long as user code can turn this off, I have no real objection. But it mig=
ht make sense to have it be more explicit =E2=80=94 have an ioctl set up a r=
ange as =E2=80=9CEAUG-on-demand=E2=80=9D.

But this is all currently irrelevant. We can argue about it when the patches=
 show up. :)=
