Here's the case that I think is perfect:
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/02/25/new-asm-flags-feature-for-x86-in-gcc-6/

Specifically the feature test preprocessor define __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__.

See exactly how we handle it in the kernel:
- https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/blob/0445971000375859008414f87e7c72fa0d809cf8/arch/x86/include/asm/asm.h#L112-L118
- https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/blob/0445971000375859008414f87e7c72fa0d809cf8/arch/x86/include/asm/rmwcc.h#L14-L30

Feature detection of the feature makes it trivial to detect when the
feature is supported, rather than brittle compiler version checks.
Had it been a GCC version check, it wouldn't work for clang out of the
box when clang added support for __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__.  But since
we had the helpful __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__, and wisely based our use
of the feature on that preprocessor define, the code ***just worked***
for compilers that didn't support the feature ***and*** compilers when
they did support the feature ***without changing any of the source
code*** being compiled.

All I'm asking for is that when GCC adds a new GNU C extension (such
as `asm inline`), define a new preprocessor symbol (like has already
been done w/ __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__), so that we don't have to use
version checking (or reimplementing autoconf) and use feature
detection instead.  This simplifies use of this feature even between
codebases supporting multiple versions of GCC.

(Also, I'm guessing the cost of another preprocessor define is near
zero compared to parsing comments for -Wimplicit-fallthrough)
