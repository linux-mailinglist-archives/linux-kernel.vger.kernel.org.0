This is a very good point, and quite important. It is not acceptable if
some crash output is cut off because of this effect.

In my v1 rfc series, I avoided this issue by having a separate dedicated
ringbuffer (rb_sprintf) that was used to allocate a temporary max-size
(2KB) buffer for sprinting to. Then _that_ was used for the real
ringbuffer input (strlen, prb_reserve, memcpy, prb_commit). That would
still be the approach of my choice.
