When you program the device number and it fails, there is still a 
Device0 reporting as attached, so you will loop and try to assign a new 
device number. In this case there is never a transition to UNATTACHED, 
the Slave remains ATTACHED as Device0 until the enumeration succeed with 
a successful non-zero device number.

This only happened to us w/ early prototypes where the PCB routing was 
questionable and the speed too high, but still it's useful to keep this 
device number constant

Thanks.
