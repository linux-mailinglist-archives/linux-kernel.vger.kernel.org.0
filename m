Sure, in theory, but it looks like there isn't a single arm64 compiler out
there which gets it right.

This appears to be fixing an ICE, whereas the issue reported recently for
arm64 gcc was silent miscompilation of atomics in some cases. Unfortunately,
I can't seem to find the thread :/ Mark, you were on that one too, right?

Sorry, not sure that you're getting at here.

Anyway, the second version of your patch looks fine, but I would still
prefer to go the extra mile and disable CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING altogether
given that I don't think it's a safe option to enable for us.
