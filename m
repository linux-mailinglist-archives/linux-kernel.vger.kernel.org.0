There is already a v9 but I comment here so the thread stays intact.

I guess this thread leads to nowhere. For me the question is do we
review against existing code or some possible future changes? The
arguments didn't convince me so far.
But we're not talking functional issues here so I won't continue to push
for change on this one here.

I went back to the v6 review. Peter originally asked for a better name
(or an additional comment) for arch_scale_thermal_capacity() because the
return value is not capacity.

So IMHO arch_scale_thermal_pressure() is a good name for keeping this
aligned w/ the other arch_scale_* functions and to address this review
comment.

arch_scale_cpu_capacity()     - scale capacity by cpu
arch_scale_freq_capacity()    - scale capacity by frequency
arch_scale_thermal_pressure() - scale pressure (1 - capacity) by thermal
