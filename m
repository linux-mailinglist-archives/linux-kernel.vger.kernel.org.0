That must depend on the AT25. The one we're using (AT25F512A), as it's 
setup, it's fast enough. The datasheet states "The CHIP ERASE cycle time 
typically is 2 seconds.". I've not timed it's because as I said, seamed 
fast enough.


If you can't erase it, then it's basically write once, or you expose it 
with spi_dev to Flashrom to erase it.

I didn't look at sector erase as I'm only interested in erasing it all 
and there was a command for it. I figured if someone wanted sector by 
sector they would implement it.

That's true, but as I said, it's fast enough it's not an issue for us.
