Hmm... right know they are added to customers data-centers but what do I know ;)

Thanks :)

MSI-X are working. The set of bit 59 doesn't apply to MSI-X
transactions (AFAICS from the PCIe controller spec we have).

Understood. In the specific system we are integrated to, that is the
case - we have less then 48 bits. But, as you pointed out, it is not a
generic solution but with my H/W I can't give a generic fit-all
solution for POWER9. I'll settle for the best that I can do.

Understood and taken care of.
