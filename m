A good question. The current code should be block size aligned. I
remember in some places we assume each block comprise all the sections.
Can't imagine one or some of them are half section filled.

It truly has a risk that system ram is very huge to make the block
size is 2G, someone try to insert a 1G memory board. However, it should
only exist in experiment environment, e.g build a guest with enough ram,
then hot add 1G DIMM. In reality, we don't need to worry about it, at
least what I saw is 512G order of magnitude.

No, if I got it right, the range on x86 is
[MIN_MEMORY_BLOCK_SIZE, MAX_BLOCK_SIZE].

MEM_SIZE_FOR_LARGE_BLOCK is the starting point from which block size can
be adjusted. Otherwise it's MIN_MEMORY_BLOCK_SIZE.

/* Amount of ram needed to start using large blocks */                                                                                            
#define MEM_SIZE_FOR_LARGE_BLOCK (64UL << 30)

The sub-section hotplug feature was added by your colleague Dan
Williams. It intends to fix a nvdimms issue that nvdimms device could be
mapped into a non section size aligned starting address. And nvdimms
makes use of the existing memory hotplug mechanism to manage pages.
Not sure if we are saying the same thing.
