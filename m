Thanks a lot for working on these patches! Finally no more duplication
of all SCM calls in qcom_scm-32.c and qcom_scm-64.c!

I spent some time testing your patches in different configurations
on my MSM8916 devices.

1. arm64 + SMC_CONVENTION_ARM_32 (MSM8916)
   Seems to work fine except for WCNSS (see my comment on patch 16).
   If you fix it like I suggested, feel free to add my
   Tested-by: Stephan Gerhold <stephan@gerhold.net>

The other configurations are not really (officially) supported by
mainline, but I tested them for the sake of completeness:

2. arm32 + SMC_CONVENTION_LEGACY (MSM8916)
   This is an (unfortunate) device with outdated firmware which can only
   boot arm32 kernels... But mainline is actually working quite well
   when compiled for arm32.

   Since the IOMMU calls were previously unimplemented for the legacy
   convention, the GPU is now working out of the box with your patches.

   Overall it seems to work fine, just same note about WCNSS.

Given that the motivation for this patch series was to support ARM SMCCC
on arm32, I also tried booting arm32 on the device from (1).
I don't care about this particular configuration, but maybe the results help:

3. arm32 + SMC_CONVENTION_ARM_32 (MSM8916)
   It works mostly but not completely. arch/arm/kernel/smccc-call.S does
   not implement ARM_SMCCC_QUIRK_QCOM_A6 (unlike the arm64 version),
   so interrupted SCM calls are not working correctly (see [1]).

   Several SCM calls are failing because of this:
       qcom-wcnss-pil a204000.wcnss: invalid firmware metadata
       remoteproc remoteproc0: Failed to load program segments: -22
       qcom-iommu soc:iommu@1f08000: secure init failed: -22
       qcom-iommu 1ef0000.iommu: secure init failed: -22

   After I changed arch/arm/kernel/smccc-call.S to implement the quirk
   with some hacky assembly everything is working correctly.

Therefore I have one question below:

Do these "newer 32-bit targets" still require the ARM_SMCCC_QUIRK_QCOM_A6
quirk? If yes, you will need to implement ARM_SMCCC_QUIRK_QCOM_A6 for
arm32 to make everything work correctly.

If not, everything is fine I guess. I don't think anyone (myself included)
will be running an arm32 kernel on an arm64-capable device...
