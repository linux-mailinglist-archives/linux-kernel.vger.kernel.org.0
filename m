It's a bit complex to virtualize the TEST_CTRL MSR because it's per core
instead of per thread. But it's still doable to virtualize it as
discussion:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191017233824.GA23654@linux.intel.com/

KVM code will be released later. Even if there is no KVM code for split
lock, the patch set will killl qemu/guest if split lock happens there.
The goal of this patch set is to have a basic enabling code.

The usage scope of this patch set is largely reduced to only real time.
The long split lock processing time (>1000 cycles) cannot be tolerated
by real time.

Real time customers do want to use this feature to detect the fatal
split lock error. They don't want any split lock issue from BIOS/EFI/
firmware/kerne/drivers/user apps.

Real time can enable the feature (set bit 29 in TEST_CTRL MSR) in BIOS and
don't need OS to enable it. But, #AC handler cannot handle split lock
in the kernel and will return to the faulting instruction and re-enter #AC. So
current #AC handler doesn't provide useful information for the customers.
That's why we add the new #AC handler in this patch set.

I believe Intel real time team guarantees to deliever a split lock FREE
BIOS/EFI/firmware to their real time users.

From kernel point of view, we are working on a split lock free kernel.
Some blocking split lock issues have been fixed in TIP tree.

Only limited user apps can run on real time and should be split lock
free before they are allowed to run on the real time system.

So the feature is enabled only for real time that wants to have
a controlled split lock free environment.

The point is a split lock issue is a FATAL error on real time. Whenever
it happens, the long processing time (>1000 cycles) cannot meet hard real
time requirement any more and the system/user app has to die.

In summary, the patch set only wants to enable the feature for real time
and disable it by default.

Thanks.
