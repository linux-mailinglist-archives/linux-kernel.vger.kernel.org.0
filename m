Ok I understand better. In this case there is no need to split this
commit, instead just reword the commit log to something like:

--->8---
Add device table for M70A series Micron SPI-NAND devices.

As opposed to the M60A series already supported, M70A parts have the
"Continuous Read" feature enabled by default which does not fit the
subsystem needs.

<here explain the feature>.

Hence, we disable the feature at probe time.
---8<---

However, below, you disable this bit for all the parts. Is this really
ok? Souldn't we make it more specific to this series?
