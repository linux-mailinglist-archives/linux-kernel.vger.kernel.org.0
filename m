Yeah, sounds like you've got it (somehow I'd completely forgotten that 
you'd already prototyped the aux domain part, and I only re-read the 
cover letter after sending that review...). TBH it's not massively 
different, just being a bit more honest about the intermediate hardware 
state. As long as we can rely on all aux domains being equivalent and 
the GPU never writing nonsense to TTBR0, then all arm-smmu really wants 
to care about is whether there's *something* live or not at any given 
time, so attach (with quirk) does:

	TTBR1 = primary_domain->ttbr
	TCR = primary_domain->tcr | EPD0

then attach_aux comes along and adds:

	TTBR0 = aux_domain->ttbr
	TCR = primary_doman->tcr | aux_domain->tcr

such that arm-smmu can be happy that TTBR0 is always pointing at *some* 
valid pagetable from that point on regardless of what subsequently 
happens underneath, and nobody need touch TCR until the party's 
completely over.

What I'm imagining isn't all that far from how we do normal domain 
attach, except instead of setting up the newly-allocated context for a 
new domain you simply clone the existing context into it, and instead of 
having a given device's set of Stream IDs to retarget you'd just scan 
though the S2CRs checking cbndx and rewriting as appropriate. Then 
finally rewrite domain->cfg.cbndx and the old context is all yours.

Sounds good, thanks!

Robin.
