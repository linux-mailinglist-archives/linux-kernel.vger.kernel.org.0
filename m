I think these are both assuming that A is reading the value stored by E
(shortly, "A reads from E")?  If so, then the two claims become/are:

  - If A reads from E, then B comes after D

  - If A reads from E, then F comes after C

I think you could avoid the (ambiguous) "comes after" and say something
like:

  (1) If A reads from E, then B reads from D (or from another store
      to ->seq, not reported in the snippet, which overwrites D)

  (2) If A reads from E, then F overwrites C

This, IIUC, for the informal descriptions of the (intended) guarantees.
Back to the pairings in question: AFAICT,

  (a) For (1), we rely on the pairing:

        RELEASE from D to E  (matching)  ADDRESS DEP. from A to B

  (b) For (2), we rely on the pairing:

        RELEASE from C to E  (matching)  ADDRESS DEP. from A to F

Does this make sense?

Oh, I see, thanks for this clarification.

IMO (and assuming that what I wrote above makes some sense), (a-b) and
(1-2) above, together with the associated annotations of the code/ops,
provide all the desired and necessary information to document MB5.

For readability purposes, it could be nice to also keep the snippet you
provided above (but let me stress, again, that such a snippet should be
integrated with additional information as suggested above).

As to "where to insert the memory barrier documentation", I really have
no suggestion ATM.  I guess someone would split it (say, before A and E)
while others could prefer to keep it within a same inline comment.

Thanks for this information (and for your patience!),

  Andrea
