Well, I think literally every line from that PR will still go in, just
wrapped in a new OSD op.  Backwards compatibility is hard...

No, some form of https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/31611 should go in.
I'm pretty certain it will come up at some point in the future, even if
the new field isn't immediately usable today.  Someone porting a change
to the kernel client a couple years from now will thank you for it ;)
