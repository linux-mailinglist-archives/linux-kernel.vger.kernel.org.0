I believe in firmware solutions more than firmware magic wands :-)

While device-specific knowledge in DtbLoader is indeed not practical,
you still need device-specific knowledge at the firmware level in the
sense that you pass a device-specific DT binary to DtbLoader to be
patched based on the panel ID. The device-specific information required
at the firmware level can thus be expressed as data instead of code.

I understand it wouldn't be practical for DtbLoader to receive two
independent pieces of device-specific data (the DT binary and another
custom data blob). Why couldn't however DtbLoader get a DT binary as
described in the commit message of this patch, and strip off all the
panel nodes that are not applicable to the platform, as well as the
panel-id property ? This would be completely transparent on the OS side,
and would not require patching DtbLoader for every device, as all the
information required would be present in a single DT binary, encoded
using DT syntax.

Ths would create a dichotomy in the DT bindings, in the sense that we
would have bindings applicable to the boot loader only, and bindings for
the OS, but this is already the case in what you're proposing here as
the panel-id property is documented as not used by the OS itself.
