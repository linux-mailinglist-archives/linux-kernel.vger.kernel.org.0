Two paths which lead to __dump_page(), dump_page() and bad_page().
Callers of dump_page() can give a single reason what they consider the
most important which leads to page dumping. This makes sense but gets
trickier in bad_page() path. At present, free_pages_check_bad() and
check_new_page_bad() has a sequence of 'if' statements which decides
"most important" reason for __dump_page() without much rationale and
similar in case of free_tail_pages_check() as well. As all information
about the page for corresponding reasons are printed with __dump_page()
anyways, do free_pages_check_bad() or check_new_page_bad() really need
to provide any particular single reason ?
