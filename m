In this case, reviewing the 224 lines you're touching in one shot feels
the same as reviewing them over 11 patches, as the change is always of
the same type. Maybe a single patch is actually even a bit quicker to
review.

Are you sure the suggestion was referring to this, and it wasn't about
different type of changes in the same patch?
