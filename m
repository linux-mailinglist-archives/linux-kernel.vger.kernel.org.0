struct device have only single dma_pfn_offset, one can not have multiple
ranges defined. If we have then only the first is taken and the physical
address and dma address is discarded, only the dma_pfn_offset is stored
and used.

But do they have dma_pfn_offset != 0?

The dma_pfn_offset is _still_ applied to the mask we are trying to set
(and validate) via dma-direct.

in dma_direct_supported:
mask == 0xffffffff // DMA_BIT_MASK(32)
dev->dma_pfn_offset == 0x780000 // Keystone 2
min_mask == 0xffffff

tmp_mask = __phys_to_dma(dev, min_mask);
tmp_mask == 0xff880ffffff

within __phys_to_dma() converts the min_mask to pfn and calls
pfn_to_dma() which does:
if (dev)
	pfn -= dev->dma_pfn_offset;

the returned pfn is then converted back to address.

the mask (0xffffffff) is well under the tmp_mask (0xff880ffffff) so
dma_direct_supported() will tell us that DMA is not supported for
DMA_BIT_MASK(32), which is not true, because DMA is supporting 32 bits.

Sure, but can we fix the regression by reverting to arm_ops for now only
if dma_pfn_offset is not 0? It used to work fine in the past at least it
appeared to work on K2 platforms.
