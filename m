I'm so sorry for the confusion.  IMA was originally limited to
extending trusted boot concepts to the OS.  As of Linux 3.10, IMA
added support for extending secure boot concepts and auditing file
hashes (commit e7c568e0fd0cf).

True, kexec_file_load is required for verifying the kexec kernel
image, but it is also required for measuring the kexec kernel image as
well.

After reading the kernel image into memory (kernel_read_file_from_fd),
the hash is calculated and then added to the IMA measurement list and
used to extend the TPM.  All of this is based on the IMA policy,
including the TPM PCR.

The TPM PCRs are not reset on a soft reboot.  As a result, in order to
validate the IMA measurement list against the TPM PCRs, the IMA
measurement list is saved on kexec load, restored on boot, and then
the memory allocated for carrying the measurement list across kexec is
freed.

Where/how to save the IMA measurement list is architecture dependent.
 Thiago Bauermann implemented allocating and freeing the measurement
list memory for Power.
