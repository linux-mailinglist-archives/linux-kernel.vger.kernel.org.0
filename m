We've already discussed that point a few times. The issue is that
bootloaders and/or BIOSes tend to wipe everything. Ideally we should
let the boot loader collect entropy from the DDR training phase since
it's a period where noise is observed. It's also the right moment to
collect some random contents that may lie in the RAM cells.

Similarly asynchronous clocks driving external components can be used
as well if you can measure their phase with the CPU's clock.
