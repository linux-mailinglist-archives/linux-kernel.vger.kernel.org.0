Awesome! I commented on the review, but just to follow up, this cuts out
all the .rela warnings.

Also commented in the review; this removes the following:

... (.bss.rel.ro) is being placed in '.bss.rel.ro'
... (.iplt) is being placed in '.iplt'
... (.plt) is being placed in '.plt'
... (.symtab_shndx) is being placed in '.symtab_shndx'

I'm now only left with:

ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.symtab) is being placed in '.symtab'
ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.shstrtab) is being placed in '.shstrtab'
ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.strtab) is being placed in '.strtab'

If PASSTHRU existed, I wouldn't want them reported as orphan sections
(since they'd be chosen). This "section" would serve two purposes:

- remove the warning about being orphan
- position the sections in a known location (FGKASLR needs this so that
  it can know where the end of the all the .text.* sections actually
  are. Right now, the correct result is effectively accidental[1].)

I only imagine it being input section descriptions. (I imagine PASSTHRU
being much like DISCARD -- it won't make sense to put output section
data there either.)

This is the only case I've got for this right now. If the "do not merge
the orphan .text.* into .text" bug is fixed, then FGKASLR can continue
to work "on accident", and nothing like PASSTHRU would be needed. :)
In this case, I would have FGKASLR disable the orphan section warning,
since it would depend on orphan handling.

Awesome. If it matches bfd, then that'll be sufficient:

https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Orphan-Sections.html

Namely:
	"If there is no output section with a matching name then new
	 output sections will be created."
and:
	"... the linker attempts to place orphan sections after sections
	 of the same attribute ..."

So .text.blah would end up in .text.blah but after .text (since they're
both code).

(And as noted earlier, --unique support is needed too.)

Thanks for looking into this! It'll be really nice to have the orphan
section warnings working in the kernel. And getting the ground work for
FGKASLR ready will be nice!

Kristen, can I convince you that FG stands for function-granular
instead of fine-grain? :)
