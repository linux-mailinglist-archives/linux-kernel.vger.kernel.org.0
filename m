The 'pp done time out' errors go away if I revert the following three
commits:

cd6d923167b1 ("drm/msm/dpu: async commit support")
d934a712c5e6 ("drm/msm: add atomic traces")
2d99ced787e3 ("drm/msm: async commit support")

I reverted the first one to fix a compiler error, and the second one so
that the last patch can be reverted without any merge conflicts.

I see that crtc_flush() calls mdp5_ctl_commit(). I tried to use
crtc_flush_all() in mdp5_flush_commit() and the contents of the frame
buffer dance around the screen like its out of sync. I renamed
crtc_flush_all() to mdp5_crtc_flush_all() and removed the static
declaration. Here's the relevant part of what I tried:

--- a/drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/mdp5/mdp5_kms.c
+++ b/drivers/gpu/drm/msm/disp/mdp5/mdp5_kms.c
@@ -171,7 +171,15 @@ static void mdp5_prepare_commit(struct msm_kms *kms, struct drm_atomic_state *st

+
+               mdp5_crtc_flush_all(crtc);
+       }
 }

Any tips would be appreciated.
