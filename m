This is used to avoid holding lock when checking whether the addresses 
are overlapped. Otherwise we need to take spinlock for each invalidation 
request even if it was the va range that is not interested for us. This 
will be very slow e.g during guest boot.

The caller vhost_net_ioctl() (or scsi and vsock) will hold device mutex 
before calling us.

So this seems unnecessary.

It could be an optimization on top.

Yes, it's not hard to fix just kfree map in this function.

I'm not sure I get the the exact issue here.

Yes, so the fix is as simple as zero the invalidate_count after 
unregister  the mmu notifier in vhost_set_vring_num_addr().

Maybe it's better to try to fix with the exist uaddr optimization first.

I did spot two other issues:

1) we don't check the return value mmu_register in vhost_set_vring_num()

2) we try to setup vq address even if set_vring_addr() fail


For the bug it self, it looks to me that the mm refcount was messed up 
since we try to register and unregister MMU notifier. But I haven't 
figured out why, will do more investigation.
