Convert all text files with s390 documentation to ReST format.

Tried to preserve as much as possible the original document
format. Still, some of the files required some work in order
for it to be visible on both plain text and after converted
to html.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

 Hints
 -----
 If you want to issue a debugger command without halting your virtual machine
-with the PA1 key try prefixing the command with #CP e.g.
-#cp tr i pswa 2000
+with the PA1 key try prefixing the command with #CP e.g.::
+
+	#cp tr i pswa 2000
+
 also suffixing most debugger commands with RUN will cause them not
 to stop just display the mnemonic at the current instruction on the console.
+
 If you have several breakpoints you want to put into your program &
 you get fed up of cross referencing with System.map
 you can do the following trick for several symbols.
-grep do_signal System.map 
-which emits the following among other things
-0001f4e0 T do_signal 
-now you can do
 
-TR I PSWA 0001f4e0 cmd msg * do_signal
+::
+
+	grep do_signal System.map
+
+which emits the following among other things::
+
+	0001f4e0 T do_signal
+
+now you can do::
+
+	TR I PSWA 0001f4e0 cmd msg * do_signal
+
 This sends a message to your own console each time do_signal is entered.
 ( As an aside I wrote a perl script once which automatically generated a REXX
 script with breakpoints on every kernel procedure, this isn't a good idea
 because there are thousands of these routines & VM can only set 255 breakpoints

 Channel Control Words:
-CCWs are linked lists of instructions initially pointed to by an operation
-request block (ORB), which is initially given to Start Subchannel (SSCH)
-command along with the subchannel number for the IO subsystem to process
-while the CPU continues executing normal code.
-CCWs come in two flavours, Format 0 (24 bit for backward compatibility) and
-Format 1 (31 bit). These are typically used to issue read and write (and many
-other) instructions. They consist of a length field and an absolute address
-field.
-Each IO typically gets 1 or 2 interrupts, one for channel end (primary status)
-when the channel is idle, and the second for device end (secondary status).
-Sometimes you get both concurrently. You check how the IO went on by issuing a
-TEST SUBCHANNEL at each interrupt, from which you receive an Interruption
-response block (IRB). If you get channel and device end status in the IRB
-without channel checks etc. your IO probably went okay. If you didn't you
-probably need to examine the IRB, extended status word etc.
-If an error occurs, more sophisticated control units have a facility known as
-concurrent sense. This means that if an error occurs Extended sense information
-will be presented in the Extended status word in the IRB. If not you have to
-issue a subsequent SENSE CCW command after the test subchannel.
+  CCWs are linked lists of instructions initially pointed to by an operation
+  request block (ORB), which is initially given to Start Subchannel (SSCH)
+  command along with the subchannel number for the IO subsystem to process
+  while the CPU continues executing normal code.
+  CCWs come in two flavours, Format 0 (24 bit for backward compatibility) and
+  Format 1 (31 bit). These are typically used to issue read and write (and many
+  other) instructions. They consist of a length field and an absolute address
+  field.
+
+  Each IO typically gets 1 or 2 interrupts, one for channel end (primary status)
+  when the channel is idle, and the second for device end (secondary status).
+  Sometimes you get both concurrently. You check how the IO went on by issuing a
+  TEST SUBCHANNEL at each interrupt, from which you receive an Interruption
+  response block (IRB). If you get channel and device end status in the IRB
+  without channel checks etc. your IO probably went okay. If you didn't you
+  probably need to examine the IRB, extended status word etc.
+  If an error occurs, more sophisticated control units have a facility known as
+  concurrent sense. This means that if an error occurs Extended sense information
+  will be presented in the Extended status word in the IRB. If not you have to
+  issue a subsequent SENSE CCW command after the test subchannel.

 For z/Architecture
 Replace 56 with 112 & ignore the &0x7fffffff
 in the macros below & do nasty casts to longs like the following
 as gdb unfortunately deals with printed arguments as ints which
 messes up everything.
-i.e. here is a 3rd backchain dereference
-p/x *(long *)(***(long ***)$sp+112)
 
+i.e. here is a 3rd backchain dereference::

+this outputs::

-this outputs 
-$5 = 0x528f18 
 on my machine.
-Now you can use

 core dumps

-What a core dump ?,
+
+What a core dump ?
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
 A core dump is a file generated by the kernel (if allowed) which contains the
 registers and all active pages of the program which has crashed.
+
 From this file gdb will allow you to look at the registers, stack trace and
 memory of the program as if it just crashed on your system. It is usually
 called core and created in the current working directory.
+
 This is very useful in that a customer can mail a core dump to a technical
 support department and the technical support department can reconstruct what
 happened. Provided they have an identical copy of this program with debugging
 symbols compiled in and the source base of this build is available.
+
 In short it is far more useful than something like a crash log could ever hope
 to be.
 
-Why have I never seen one ?.
-Probably because you haven't used the command 
-ulimit -c unlimited in bash

-ulimit -a

 (e.g. device drivers) can have one separate debug log.
 One purpose of this is to inspect the debug logs after a production system crash
 in order to analyze the reason for the crash.

 If the system still runs but only a subcomponent which uses dbf fails,
 it is possible to look at the debug logs on a live system via the Linux

 It is also possible to deactivate the debug feature globally for every
 debug log. You can change the behavior using  2 sysctl parameters in
 /proc/sys/s390dbf:
+
 There are currently 2 possible triggers, which stop the debug feature
 globally. The first possibility is to use the "debug_active" sysctl. If
 set to 1 the debug feature is running. If "debug_active" is set to 0 the
 debug feature is turned off.
+
 The second trigger which stops the debug feature is a kernel oops.
 That prevents the debug feature from overwriting debug information that
 happened before the oops. After an oops you can reactivate the debug feature
 by piping 1 to /proc/sys/s390dbf/debug_active. Nevertheless, its not
 suggested to use an oopsed kernel in a production environment.
+
 If you want to disallow the deactivation of the debug feature, you can use
 the "debug_stoppable" sysctl. If you set "debug_stoppable" to 0 the debug
 feature cannot be stopped. If the debug feature is already stopped, it
 will stay deactivated.

 function would do. The sprintf event/exception functions write to the
-debug entry a pointer to the format string (size = sizeof(long)) 
-and for each vararg a long value. So e.g. for a debug entry with a format

 For header_proc there can be used the default function
 debug_dflt_header_fn() which is defined in debug.h.
 and which produces the same header output as the predefined views.

 In order to see how to use the callback functions check the implementation
 of the default views!
