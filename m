We are trying to make sure that all (most) drivers in an Aarch64 system can
be kernel modules for Android, like any other desktop system for
example. There are a number of problems we need to fix before that happens
ofcourse.

That patch series does the following -

1. Resolve the consumer<->supplier relationship in order for subsystems to
turn off resources to save power is #1 on our list. This is because it will
define how driver and DT writers define and write their code for Android
devices.

2. Resolve cyclic dependency between devices nodes as a side-effect.  That
will make sure Android systems do not suffer from deferred probing and we
have a generic way of serialize driver probes. (This can also be mitigated
somewhat by module dependencies outside of the kernel.)

Subsystems like regulator, interconnect can immediately benefit from #1 and
it makes the module/driver loading possible for Android systems without
regressing power horribly.

After thinking about Rob's suggestion to loop though dependencies, I think it
doesn't work because we don't know what to do when there are cycles. Drivers
sometimes need to have access to phandles in order to retrieve resources from
that phandle. We can't assume that is an implied "probe dependency". Saravana
had several such examples already and it is a _real world_ scenario.

I think the current binding are insufficient to describe the runtime hardware
dependencies. IOW, the current bindinds were probably intended to be that, but
drivers use them to get phandles for other nodes too and are not *strict*
dependencies. Either way, for Android systems to realize this goal of having
driver modules load on demand, we have to have something that does what this
patch series does.

I am also sensitive to the fact that adding a new binding in "depends-on"
will mean all Android devices will start *depending on* that DT binding (no
pun intended) without any upstream support. We want to avoid that as much
as possible.

I guess we are happy to hear better ways of doing this that work, but in the
absence of that, we are going to have to carry the series for Android and
that makes me sad :(

Suggestions, thoughts, for what Android should do here...?

Thanks
