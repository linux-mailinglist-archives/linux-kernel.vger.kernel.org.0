One problem I have when testing this branch: the weight of the croup
seems to be ignored.

On a 2sockets/16cores/32threads VM, I grouped 8 sysbench(cpu mode)
threads into one cgroup(cgA) and another 16 sysbench(cpu mode) threads
into another cgroup(cgB). cgA and cgB's cpusets are set to the same
socket's 8 cores/16 CPUs and cgA's cpu.shares is set to 10240 while cgB's
cpu.shares is set to 2(so consider cgB as noise workload and cgA as
the real workload).

I had expected cgA to occupy 8 cpus(with each cpu on a different core)
most of the time since it has way more weight than cgB, while cgB should
occupy almost no CPUs since:
 - when cgB's task is in the same CPU queue as cgA's task, then cgB's
   task is given very little CPU due to its small weight;
 - when cgB's task is in a CPU queue whose sibling's queue has cgA's
   task, cgB's task should be forced idle(again, due to its small weight).
 
But testing shows cgA occupies only 2 cpus during the entire run while
cgB enjoys the remaining 14 cpus. As a comparison, when coresched is off,
cgA can occupy 8 cpus during its run.

I haven't taken a look at the patches, but would like to raise the
problem first. My gut feeling is that, we didn't make the CPU's load
balanced.

P.S. it's not that I care about VM's performance, it's just easier to
test kernel stuff using a VM than on a bare metal. Its CPU setup might
seem weird, I just set it up to be the same as my host setup.
