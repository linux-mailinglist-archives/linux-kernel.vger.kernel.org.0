Tested with kexec maybe but if the 0day bot keeps finding breakage, that
ain't good enough.

As I already explained, that is not good enough.

And that is never the right approach.

Maintainers are busy as hell so !urgent stuff gets to wait. Spamming
them with more patchsets does not help - fixing stuff properly does.

So, to sum up: if Arvind's approach is the better one, then we should do
that and s390 should be fixed this way too. And all tested. And we will
remove the hurry element from it all since it has not been noticed so
far so it is not urgent and we can take our time and fix it properly.

Ok?

Thx.
