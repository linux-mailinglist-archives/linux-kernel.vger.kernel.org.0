So after adding a dump_stack() at the beginning of this function (yap,
I'm lazy) I see during boot:

and also on all the remaining 15 CPUs of the guest. Then, suspending to
RAM and resuming right afterwards says:

and the remaining 14(!). Yes, this doesn't run on the BSP during resume.
I think the better thing to do would be to stick this in a CPUHP
notifier...

Btw:

Subject: Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender
