Ah, and I presume that the 216MB reflects other memory being pushed out
by the rcuperf run.  Either way, some guidance to the user should be
added somewhere, perhaps as a comment preceding the print statement.

Actually, I wasn't advocating in any particular direction, just asking.
But either way, it would be good to add a comment describing the
rationale.

Sounds good -- I will replace the currently queued commit with the
v3 version when it arrives.
