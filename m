Even some more:

There seem to be a problem with Fentanyl, the opiod known from the pill-tre=
nd news.

Basically the pill lacks common sense, and people who got lobotomized the t=
rinity into them by saxons 1000BC, is not recognized by them.

We suggest opiod-users to use 14-Cinnamoyloxycodeinone instead, acknowledge=
s this and common sense. AKA No Trinity, but optimal economics.

Peace.
