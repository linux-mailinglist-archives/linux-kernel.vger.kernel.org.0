Rename the md documentation files to ReST, add an
index for them and adjust in order to produce a nice html
output via the Sphinx build system.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

 2.3 new-device management
+-------------------------
 
  A single lock: "no-new-dev" is used to co-ordinate the addition of
  new devices - this must be synchronized across the array.
  Normally all nodes hold a concurrent-read lock on this device.
 
 3. Communication
+================
 
  Messages can be broadcast to all nodes, and the sender waits for all
  other nodes to acknowledge the message before proceeding.  Only one
  message can be processed at a time.
 
 3.1 Message Types
+-----------------
 
  There are six types of messages which are passed:
 
- 3.1.1 METADATA_UPDATED: informs other nodes that the metadata has

    failure.

    sending node is about to resync. This overrides any previous
    notification from that node: only one ranged can be resynced at a
    time per-node.

 3.2 Communication mechanism
+---------------------------
 
  The DLM LVB is used to communicate within nodes of the cluster. There
  are three resources used for the purpose:
 
-  3.2.1 token: The resource which protects the entire communication
+3.2.1 token

    acknowledged by all nodes in the cluster. The BAST of the resource
    is used to inform the receiving node that a node wants to
    communicate.
