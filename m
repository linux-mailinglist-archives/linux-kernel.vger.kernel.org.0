Thanks for the report and sorry for the breakage.  Can you please send
me more information for how to precisely reproduce the issue?  I'm
happy to look into fixing it.

Let me go dig up the different listed flags.  Steve, it may be fastest
for you to test re-adding them in your setup to see which one is
important.

Tglx, if you want to revert the above patches, I'm ok with that.  It's
important that we fix the issue eventually that my patches were meant
to address, but precisely *when* it's solved isn't critical; our
kernels can carry out of tree patches for now until the issue is
completely resolved worst case.
