It works within limits so it can be definitely be maintained for
backwards compatibility.

Also, you are making a claim of the users that we cannot verify.

Finally, the new feature neither handles sessions. You claim that
it could be added later. I have to deny that because until session
handling is there we have no ways to be sure about that.

I see your point but this needs more consideration. It does not
make sense to rush.
