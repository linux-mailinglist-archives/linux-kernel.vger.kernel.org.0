Subject: [PATCH v4 0/4] sched/fair: Capacity aware wakeup rework
Date:   Thu,  6 Feb 2020 19:19:53 +0000

This series is about replacing the current wakeup logic for asymmetric CPU
capacity topologies, i.e. wake_cap().

Details are in patch 1, the TL;DR is that wake_cap() works fine for
"legacy" big.LITTLE systems (e.g. Juno), since the Last Level Cache (LLC)
domain of a CPU only spans CPUs of the same capacity, but somewhat broken
for newer DynamIQ systems (e.g. Dragonboard 845C), since the LLC domain of
a CPU can span all CPUs in the system. Both example boards are supported in
mainline.

A bit of history
================

Due to the old Energy Model (EM) used until Android Common Kernel v4.14
which grafted itself onto the sched domain hierarchy, mobile topologies
have been represented with "phantom domains"; IOW we'd make a DynamIQ
topology look like a big.LITTLE one:

actual hardware:

  +-------------------+
  |        L3         |
  +----+----+----+----+
  | L2 | L2 | L2 | L2 |
  +----+----+----+----+
  |CPU0|CPU1|CPU2|CPU3|
  +----+----+----+----+
     ^^^^^     ^^^^^
    LITTLEs    bigs

vanilla/mainline topology:

  MC [       ]
      0 1 2 3

phantom domains topology:

  DIE [        ]
  MC  [   ][   ]
       0 1  2 3

With the newer, mainline EM this is no longer required, and wake_cap() is
the last sticking point to getting rid of this legacy crud. More details
and examples are in patch 1.

Notes
=====

This removes the use of SD_BALANCE_WAKE for asymmetric CPU capacity
topologies (which are the last mainline users of that flag), as such it
shouldn't be a surprise that this comes with significant improvements to
wake-intensive workloads: wakeups no longer go through the
select_task_rq_fair() slow-path.

Testing
=======

I've picked sysbench --test=threads to mimic Peter's testing mentioned in

  commit 182a85f8a119 ("sched: Disable wakeup balancing")

Sysbench results are the number of events handled in a fixed amount of
time, so higher is better. Hackbench results are the usual time taken for
the thing, so lower is better.

Note: the 'X%' stats are the percentiles, so 50% is the 50th percentile.

Juno r0 ("legacy" big.LITTLE)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is 2 bigs and 4 LITTLEs:

| max  | 15877.000000 | 15730.000000 |    -0.926 |

Note: you'll notice the results aren't as good as with v3; from playing
around with v4 this seems to come from removing the (broken) capacity_orig
heuristic. 

Pixel3 (DynamIQ)
++++++++++++++++

Ideally I would have used a DB845C but had a few issues with mine, so I
went with a mainline-ish Pixel3 instead [1]. It's still the same SoC under
the hood (Snapdragon 845), which has 4 bigs and 4 LITTLEs:

  +-------------------------------+

Revisions
=========

v3 -> v4
--------
o Removed max capacity_orig heuristic (Dietmar)
o (new patch) Removed for_each_lower_domain() (Dietmar)
o Made select_idle_sibling() bail out after going through
  select_idle_capacity() (Pavan)
o Added use of sched_idle_cpu() in select_idle_capacity() (Pavan)
o Corrected the signoff order in patch 1

v2 -> v3
--------
o Added missing sync_entity_load_avg() (Quentin)
o Added fallback CPU selection (maximize capacity)
o Added special case for CPU hogs: task_fits_capacity() will always return 'false'
  for tasks that are simply too big, due to the margin.

v1 -> v2
--------
o Removed unrelated select_idle_core() change
