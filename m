I would not like to bind this to only CPUs that have RDRAND. 
That's why I was looking into using kernel's CSRNG (we can also use it
as backup when rdrand is not available).

This should not apply to the proper CSRNG. They of course also have a
limitation on the amount of bits they can produce safely (as any crypto
primitive), but this period is very big and within that it does not affect
any other user of this CSPRNG, otherwise all guarantees are broken.

Yes, but my main issues with RDRAND (even if we focus strictly onx86) are:
- it is not available on older PCs
- its performance varies across CPUs that support it (and as I understood varies quite some)
The last one can actually give unpleasant surprises...

I will try asking around about concrete details on RDRAND behavior. 
I have various bits and pieces I have been told plus measurements I did, but things 
don't quite add up..

I will ask around on what is the best way to use RDRAND for our purpose.

So, if we go the CPU randomness path, then what do we fall back to when
RNRAND is not available? Skip randomization altogether or backup to
CSRNG?

Elena.
