You can reorder patches so that kvm_x86_ops assignments never happen.
That way, 4/13 for example would be moved to the very beginning.

Do you mean adding a whitelist to modpost?  That would work, though I am
not sure if the module maintainer (Jessica Yu) would accept that.

I agree.

The answer is maintainability.  My suggestion is that we start looking
into removing all assignments and tests of kvm_x86_ops, one step at a
time.  Until this is done, unfortunately we won't be able to reap the
performance benefit.  But the advantage is that this can be done in many
separate submissions; it doesn't have to be one huge patch.

Once this is done, removing kvm_x86_ops is trivial in the end.  It's
okay if the intermediate step has minimal performance regressions, we
know what it will look like.  I have to order patches with maintenance
first and performance second, if possible.

By the way, we are already planning to make some module parameters
per-VM instead of global, so this refactoring would also help that effort.

That is good enough to prove the feasibility of the idea, so I agree
that was a good plan.
