The allocator for swiotlb is buried deep in the swiotlb code. It is 
not exposed to the outside-swiotlb world. Will have to do major surgery
to expose it.

I was thinking, maybe we share the page, finish the INDIRECT_TCE call,
and unshare the page.  This will address Alexey's concern of having
shared pages at random location, and will also give me my performance
optimization.  Alexey: ok?
