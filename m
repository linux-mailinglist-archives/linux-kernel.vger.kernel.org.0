I've never tried, but are you saying that even with the "10 second
hold" the laptop's DRAM may still have old data that is accessible?

Would a best effort 1 page buffer work? Really, with a hard hang we
usually only care about the last thing that was printed (we need to add
one of those: stop printing after the first WARN_ON is hit, to not
lose the initial bug).

That way you could have a buffer that is written to constantly but only
is the size of one or two pages. It can have a variable in it that gets
reset on shutdown. If the system hangs, the next boot could look to see
if that page was shutdown cleanly (or never initialized) otherwise, it
can read the page or pages into a buffer that can be read from debugfs.

A user space tool could read this page and if it detects that it
contains data from a crash, notify the user and say "Can you send this
to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org"? Even better if it tells the user the
subject and content of the email that should be sent.
