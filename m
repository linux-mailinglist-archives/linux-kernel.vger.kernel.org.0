I'm not entirely convinced. The reason the high watermark exists is to have
kswapd work long enough to make progress without a process having to direct
reclaim. The most straight-forward example would be a streaming reader of
a large file. It'll keep pushing the zone towards the low watermark and
kswapd has to keep ahead of the reader. If we cut kswapd off too quickly,
the min watermark is hit and stalls occur. While kswapd could stop at the
min watermark, it leaves a very short window for kswapd to make enough
progress before the min watermark is hit.

At minimum, any change in this area would need to include the /proc/vmstats
on allocstat and pg*direct* to ensure that direct reclaim stalls are
not worse.

I'm not a fan of the patch in question because kswapd can be woken between
the low and min watermark without stalling but we really do expect kswapd
to make progress and continue to make progress to avoid future stalls. The
changelog had no information on the before/after impact of the patch and
this is an area where intuition can disagree with real behaviour.
