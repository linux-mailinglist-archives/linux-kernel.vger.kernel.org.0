Slave does not have a separate device. IIRC the properties for Slave are
in /sys/bus/soundwire/device/<slave>/...

For master yes we can skip the device creation, it was done for
consistency sake of having these properties ties into sys/bus/soundwire/

I don't mind if they are shown up in respective device node (PCI/platform
etc) /sys/bus/foo/device/<> 

But for creating subdirectories you would need the new dpX devices.
