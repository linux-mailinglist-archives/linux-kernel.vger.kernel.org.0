Like that, yes, but the test has to be made while fetch_lock is held.  
Otherwise there's still a race: One thread could pass the test and then
do the resize, and in between another thread could map the buffer and
incur a fault.

Incidentally, the comment for fetch_lock says that it protects b_read 
and b_out, but mon_bin_vma_fault doesn't use either of those fields.
