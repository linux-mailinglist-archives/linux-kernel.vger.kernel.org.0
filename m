I think you are too focused on the probe case and not realizing the 
extensions suggested by this patchset. A "driver" is not limited to 
'probe' and 'remove' cases.

As mentioned since mid-September, there is a need for an initialization 
of software/kernel structures (which I called probe but should have been 
called init really), and a second step where the hardware is actually 
configured - after all power rail dependencies are under control.

Can you please look at the .startup callback and let me know how a 
'driver core' would handle this?

To the best of my knowledge, there is no .startup in any device model 
functionality, so the only thing I could do to avoid a direct call is 
add a wrapper to avoid a direct call, e.g.

static inline sdw_master_device_startup(struct sdw_master_device *md)
{
     if (md && md->driver && md->driver->startup)
         md->driver->startup(md);
}
