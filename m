I have tested this on the ACPI-based system where we have 55 lines of IOAPIC,
no PIC, and some GPIO lines. Overall I see that nr_irqs is 512 and shifting
by 55 freezes 10% of the space for nothing. Luckily we have SPARSE_IRQS
selected for any X86, so, it wouldn't waste memory.

I think we may do slightly better if we just limit the change to the certain
cases.
