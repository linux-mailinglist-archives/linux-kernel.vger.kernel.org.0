Mostly yes, v1 contains the one place a message should be added.

Let me bike shed a little bit though.

I suggested a different wording for the message in v2, but I
do not think my attempt at wording was precise enough.  I
would instead suggest:

  "node label '%s' not found in live devicetree symbols table\n"

Some subtle differences.
  - It is a node label, not a node name.
  - If multiple overlays are applied, then the intention may have
    been to supply the node label via a previously applied overlay
    instead of from the base devicetree.  So specifying the live
    devicetree is more accurate.

Please submit v3 for mainline.

Thanks,

Frank
