Yup.  The point is that I see the sphinx-build output *in the docs-build
output", not when I run it standalone (where it does the expected thing).

Yeah, I had it set to -j1 because I want to wait as long as possible for my
docs builds :)

No, I didn't have it set separately, made a point of that.

$ perl -e 'open IN,"sphinx-build --version |"; while (<IN>) { if (m/([\d\.]+)/) { print "-jauto\n" if ($1 >= "1.7") } ;} close IN'
sphinx-build 1.8.4

It works properly with 2.0.1 - but only on the command line; I still don't
get the right behavior in a docs build.

Most weird.

This is an Fedora 30 system, FWIW.
