Is there any reason why we can't reference both mem cgroup and kmem
cache per each charged kmem page? I mean,

  page->mem_cgroup references mem_cgroup
  page->kmem_cache references kmem_cache
  mem_cgroup references kmem_cache while it's online

TBO it seems to me that not taking a reference to mem cgroup per charged
kmem page makes the code look less straightforward, e.g. as you
mentioned in the commit log, we have to use mod_lruvec_state() for memcg
pages and mod_lruvec_page_state() for root pages.

But a cache can be dangling for quite a while after cgroup was taken
down, even after this patch, because there still can be pages charged to
it. The reason why we call sysfs_slab_remove() is to delete associated
files from sysfs ASAP. I'd try to preserve the current behavior if
possible.

This code may be called from irq context AFAIU so you should use
irq-safe primitive.

I may be totally wrong here, but I have a suspicion we don't really need
rcu here.

As I see it, you add this code so as to prevent memcg_kmem_get_cache
from dereferencing a destroyed kmem cache. Can't we continue using
css_tryget_online for that? I mean, take rcu_read_lock() and try to get
css reference. If you succeed, then the cgroup must be online, and
css_offline won't be called until you unlock rcu, right? This means that
the cache is guaranteed to be alive until then, because the cgroup holds
a reference to all its kmem caches until it's taken offline.

I would completely switch from the mutex to the new spin lock -
acquiring them both looks weird.
