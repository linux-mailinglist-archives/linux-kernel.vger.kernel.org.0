I also agree, but believe that it should be renamed to is_hydra_midr() 
as Bjorn suggests, since there is a "kryo" architecture which has 
different part ids, and I think continuing to use "kryo" for the current 
errata will be confusing if there is errata for the kryo architecture in 
the future.

Of course, it doesn't help that marketing seems to have used "kryo" for 
both architectures.
