That still begs the question of who "you" is and how they know they're 
debugging an IOMMU issue in the first place. When all the developer has 
to go on is a third-hand bugzilla attachment from a distro user's vague 
report of graphics corruption/poor I/O performance/boot 
failure/whatever, being able to tell straight away from a standard dmesg 
dump whether an IOMMU is even in the picture or not saves a lot of 
protracted back-and-forth for everyone involved.

Under what justification? Users with slow consoles or who just want a 
quiet boot are already free to turn down the loglevel; a handful of 
messages at boot-time and device hotplug seem hardly at risk of drowning 
out all the systemd audit spam anyway. Note that the IOMMU subsystem is 
by nature a little atypical as a lot of what it does is only visible as 
secondary effects on other drivers and subsystems, without their 
explicit involvement or knowledge. In that respect, hiding its activity 
can arguably lead to more non-obvious situations than many other subsystems.

 From a personal standpoint, can we at least eradicate all the "Hi! I'm 
a driver/subsystem you don't even have the hardware for!" messages 
first, then maybe come back and reconsider the ones that convey actual 
information later?
