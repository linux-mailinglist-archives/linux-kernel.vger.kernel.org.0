Thanks for the context Frank. I'm okay with (1) or (2) but I'll stick
with (1) for this series. Didn't realize there were options (2) and
(3). Since you started reviewing from v7, I'll do that in the future
updates? Also, I haven't forgotten your emails. Just tied up with
something else for a few days. I'll get to your emails next week.

Thanks,
Saravana
