The caller might guarantee count > 0, but for robustness, I decided to
choose 4-line error handling here because I merged the normal and the
failure path control flow; read will remain 0 if count == 0, and thus
err should remain 0.

Is it possible that copy_from_user() corrupts user buffer in a way that userspace
cannot retry when kernel responded with "there was a short write"? It seems that
these functions are difficult to return appropriate errors...

Yes. I think for now we should just make these functions killable. Then, we
can try changing return code for partial read/write. If no breakage report,
we can make these functions interruptible.

You can do it. It's a syzbot's bug report. I just forwarded it. ;-)
