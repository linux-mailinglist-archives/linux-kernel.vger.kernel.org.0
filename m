Yes, you are right. The previous version of kernel did not have the 
callback of pre/post_req, so our drivers all took dma operation, which 
would improve the interaction efficiency.

I still have a doubt. In kernel, block layer calls the callback of 
pre/post_req to complete the mode selection, so the call of sdio is 
omitted. Since the read and write operation of sdio does not go through 
the interface of block layer, is this the function loss of the framework?

You are concerned that the umap_sg() operation will be repeated in 
request_done(), which is risky.So we can restrict that.
For example:
1. Add conditions in the driver. When only operating on sdio devices, 
pre/post_req interface is called in the driver.
2. Determine whether host_cookie has been assigned 
SD_EMMC_DESC_CHAIN_MODE before calling pre/post_req. If host_cookie has 
been assigned, it means that the block layer has called pre/post_req 
callback.
This should prevent duplicate calls.What do you think?
