On behalf of the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board (TAB), I
would like to announce the following changes to our charter, available
at https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/tab/start

- Line 2b that previously read "All members shall be elected by a vote
amongst all invitees of the Linux Kernel Summit." is changed to "All
members shall be elected by a vote amongst all attendees of the Linux
Kernel Summit."

This clarifies that kernel summit is no longer invite only.

- Under meetings and membership, the following line is added
"The TAB, at its discretion, may set criteria to allow for absentee
voting for those who are unable to attend the Linux Kernel Summit."

For those who like diff form, this looks like

diff --git a/charter b/charter

      - Promote and Support the programmes with which the TAB is charged 
to the wider Linux and Open Source Communities.
    - Meetings and Membership.
      - The TAB consists of ten voting members.
-    - All members shall be elected by a vote amongst all invitees of 
the Linux Kernel Summit.
+    - All members shall be elected by a vote amongst all attendees of 
the Linux Kernel Summit.
+    - The TAB, at its discretion, may set criteria to allow for 
absentee voting for those who are unable to attend the Linux Kernel Summit.
      - Self nominations for the election shall be accepted from any 
person, via email to the TAB mailing list, up until the time of the 
election.
      - Membership of the TAB shall be for a term of 2 years with 
staggered 1-year elections.
      - The TAB shall elect a Chair and Vice-Chair of the TAB from 
amongst their members to serve a renewable 1 year term.


This change is intended to be a follow on to last year's changes to vote
electronically instead of using paper ballots
(see 
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2019-July/006582.html)
We will be announcing criteria for absentee voting at a later date.

If you have any questions, feel free to speak up here or privately at
tab@lists.linuxfoundation.org.

Thanks,
Laura
