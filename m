linux-next was fine as the fix was in the i2c tree.  Sorry for not
realizing it here as well, it didn't show up on my test builds as I
wasn't doing 'allmodconfig' for USB stuff.

If it's any consolation, it was a lot worse, I did take some fixups for
other issues like this that came in through here :)

But I should have caught this as well, sorry, and thanks for merging.
