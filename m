Expected is I think a big word. That is, I would certainly not expect
that, but I think I can see how it can happen.

Suppose that init sections are placed at the end (didn't verify, but
makes sense), then suppose that A's 18 is in an init section, which gets
freed once the module load is completed. We then proceed to load B,
which then overlaps with what used to be A's init.

If this were the case, then while we could retain the pach location for
A's 18, we would never actually modify it, because it's gotten marked
freed or something (that's how jump_labels work, I didn't check what
ftrace actually does here).

So while the above contains some assumptions, it is a semi plausable
explanation for what you've described.
