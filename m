I have tested the patch in a pv domU and in dom0.  The kernel was built 
with a default Ubuntu .config which sets CONFIG_PANIC_TIMEOUT=0. uname 
-r = 5.0.0-27-generic.

In the domU (no custom kernel parameters):

- sysrq-c: I saw my debug printk messages about kmsg_dump() being 
invoked after the traceback and the domain became listed as crashed in 
the xl status output.

- halt -p: clean shutdown

- shutdown -r now: clean reboot


In the domU with panic=15 in kernel parameters:

- sysrq-c: as without panic=15 then final message "Rebooting in 15 
seconds.." printed but domain never rebooted.  Without this patch the 
domain doesn't reboot or print the Rebooting message presumably because 
of the non-returning panic handler.  If that message is reached then I 
think I would expect a reboot.  (In our Linux 4.4 / Xen 4.8.4 
environment no value of panic resulted in reboot.)

- halt -p: clean shutdown

- shutdown -r now: clean reboot


In dom0 with oops=panic panic=15 in the kernel parameters:

- sysrq-c: kmsg_dump() debug messages printed, last linux message 
"Rebooting in 15 seconds..", after 15s "(XEN) Hardware Dom0 crashed: 
rebooting machine in 5 seconds.", after 5s system rebooted.  On the 
next start a pstore record is present as expected.

- halt -p: clean shutdown, no pstore record present on next start.

- shutdown -r now: clean reboot, no pstore record present on next 
start.


In dom0 with panic=0:

- sysrq-c: dom0 crashes, no reboot messages printed from Xen or kernel 
and system hangs.  A pstore record is present on next start.

- halt -p: clean shutdown, no pstore record present on next start.

- shutdown -r now: clean reboot, no pstore record present on next 
start.


In my opinion this patch:
 - fixes the original issue of no pstore record being generated for a 
dom0 panic.
 - respects the dom0 panic=... value.  This is a change in behaviour in 
how xen handles the crashed dom0 from always rebooting to only rebooting 
if panic > 0.
 - causes a Rebooting message to be printed in a crashed pv domU when 
panic > 0 but the domain does not reboot when it should.
