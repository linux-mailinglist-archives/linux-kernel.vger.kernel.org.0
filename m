Is the plan to split the console_lock up into a per-console thing? Or
postponed for later on?

Just crossed my mind: Could/should we lockdep-annotate pr_flush (take
a lockdep map in there that we also take around the calls down into
console drivers in each of the console printing kthreads or something
like that)? Just to avoid too many surprises when people call pr_flush
from within gpu drivers and wonder why it doesn't work so well.
Although with this nice plan we'll take the modeset paths fully out of
the printk paths (even for normal outputs) I hope, so should be a lot
more reasonable.

From gpu perspective this all sounds extremely good and first
realistic plan that might lead us to an actually working bsod on
linux. But we'll make it pink w/ yellow text or something like that
ofc :-)

Thanks, Daniel
