On msm-3.10 kernel the gpu clk seems to be controlled by the RPM[1].
What is going on here? This code just looks wrong, but I think it was
added as an rcg so that the branch wasn't orphaned and would have some
sane frequency. Eventually we planned to parent it to a clk exposed in
the RPM clk driver. It's been a while so I'm having a hard time
remembering, but I think GPU clk on this device needed to be controlled
by RPM so that DDR self refresh wouldn't interact badly with ocmem? Or
maybe ocmem needed GPU to be enabled to work? Maybe there is some
information in the 3.10 downstream kernel.
