I only took a quick look at the ipc code, but there does not appear to be
a quick/easy change to make.  The issue is that shared memory creation could
take a long time.  With issue [1] above unresolved, creation of hugetlb backed
shared memory segments could take a VERY long time.

I do not believe the test failure is arm specific.  Most likely, it is just
because testing was done on a system with memory size to trigger this issue?

My plan is to focus on [1].  When that is resolved, this issue should go away.
