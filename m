I don't want the behavior of an madvise command to change depending on
*how* the command is invoked. MADV_PAGEOUT should do the same thing
regardless. If you want to allow purging of shared pages as well,
please add a new MADV_PAGEOUT_ALL or something and require a privilege
to use it.

On many different occasions over the past few years, I've found myself
wanting to ask the kernel to do bulk memory management operations. I'd
much rather add *one* facility to allow for multiple-target mm
operations than add one-off special cases for specific callers cases
as they come up. If we had such a bulk operation, the kernel could
inspect the bulk operation payload, see whether the number of
MADV_PAGEOUT requests for a given page were equal to the share count
for that page, and, if so, evict that page despite it being shared.
