The idle loop always was unwatched, even back in DYNIX/ptx.  And watching
the idle loop requires waking up idle CPUs, which makes lots of people
quite unhappy.  But it could be done with something sort of like
synchronize_rcu_tasks(), as long as this didn't need to be used in
production on battery-powered systems.
