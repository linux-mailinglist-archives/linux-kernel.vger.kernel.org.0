Right, seems like

  65a4433aebe3 ("sched/fair: Fix load_balance() affinity redo path")

also played in this area. From surface level it looks like it only reduced
the amount of CPUs the load_balance() redo can use (and interestingly it
mentions the exact same bug as you observed, through triggered slightly
differently).

I'd be inclined to say that the issue was introduced by afdeee0510db, since
from looking at the code from that time I can see the issue happening:

- try to pull from a CPU with only tasks pinned to itself
- set sgc->imbalance
- redo with a CPU that sees no big imbalance
- goto out_balanced
- env.LBF_ALL_PINNED is still set but we clear sgc->imbalance
