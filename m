Was this in response to Cedric's comment, or to my comment?

This doesn't address restricting which processes can run which enclaves,
it only allows restricting the build flow.  Or are you suggesting this
be done in addition to whitelisting sigstructs?

What's the value prop beyond whitelisting sigstructs?  Realistically, I
doubt LSMs/users will want to take the performance hit of scanning the
source bytes every time an enclave is loaded.

We could add seomthing like security_enclave_mprotect() in lieu of abusing
security_file_mprotect(), but passing the full source bytes seems a bit
much.
