Then we should update the comment!

Without serialisation, timer_pending() as currently implemented does
not reliably tell you whether the timer is in the hlist. Is that not a
problem? Using an RCU hlist does not introduce serialisation, but does
at least rule out the case where timer_pending() returns false for a
timer that /is/ reachable in the list by another CPU.

If that was the case, then you wouldn't need to touch hlist_add_before()
at all so there's got to be more to it than that or we can revert that
part of the patch.
