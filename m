It does seem strange. But also quite consistent. I will check again on that.

Yeah, right, so I think that a single ITS is used due to some HW bug in 
the ES chip, fixed in the CS chip.

And some more background on the D05, D06ES, D06CS topology:

Even though the system is 2x socket, we model as 4x NUMA nodes, i.e. 2x 
nodes per socket. This is because each node has an associated memory 
controller in the socket, i.e. 2x memory controllers per socket. As 
such, for this D06ES system, a NUMA node is 24 cores.

I will be the first to admit that it does make things more complicated. 
Even more especially (and arguably broken) when we need to assign a 
proximity domain to devices in either socket, considering they are 
equidistant from either memory controller/CPU cluster in that socket.

Right, but my system is incompatible. Reason being, SRAT says ITS is 
NUMA node #0 (I think choosing node #0 over #1 may be just arbitrary), 
and the cpu mask for NUMA node #0 is 0-23, as above. And I figure even 
for D06CS with 2x ITS, again, is incompatible for the same reason.

So your expectation for a single ITS system would be that the NUMA node 
cpu mask for the ITS would cover all cpus. Sadly, it doesn't here...

Much appreciated,
John
