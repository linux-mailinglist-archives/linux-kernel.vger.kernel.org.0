Yes we had that discussion in the thread I pointed to. I initially 
suggested and argued for updating the vma::vm_page_prot using a 
WRITE_ONCE() (we only have the mmap_sem in read mode), there seems to be 
other places in generic code that does the same.

But I was convinced by Andy that this was the right way and also was 
used elsewhere.

(See also 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch/x86/entry/vdso/vma.c#L116)

I guess to have this properly formulated, what's required is that 
generic code doesn't build page-table entries using vma::vm_page_prot 
for VM_PFNMAP and VM_MIXEDMAP outside of driver control.
