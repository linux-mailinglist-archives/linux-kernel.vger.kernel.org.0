I'm aware that you want to use IPIs for broadcasting TLB invalidation
but that is only tangentially related to this thread, which is about the
current ASID algorithm and the need to update mm_cpumask today.

Please don't conflate the two threads; I already made my position reasonably
clear:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20190617170328.GJ30800@fuggles.cambridge.arm.com/

I will follow-up with another reply there.
