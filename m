Sure, I'll move it. When it was named p?d_large() this had to come after
some architectures that implement p?d_large() as static inline. But
p?d_leaf() doesn't have that issue.

Ok, how about:

The name p?d_leaf() is chosen because to minimize the confusion with
existing uses of "large" pages and "huge" pages which do not necessary
mean that the entry is a leaf (for example it may be a set of contiguous
entries that only take 1 TLB slot). For the purpose of walking the page
tables we don't need to know how it will be represented in the TLB, but
we do need to know for sure if it is a leaf of the tree.

Yes only meaningful on valid entries - I'll add that as a comment.

Thanks for the review
