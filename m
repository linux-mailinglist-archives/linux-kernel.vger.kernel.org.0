For the devices that support online/offline (like CPUs in memory), the
idea is that calling device_del() on them while they are in use may
cause problems like data loss to occur and note that device_del()
itself cannot fail (because it needs to handle surprise removal too).
However, offline can fail, so the rule of thumb is to do the offline
(and handle the errors possibly returned by it) and only call
device_del() if that is successful.

Of course, if surprise removal is possible, offline is kind of
pointless, but if it is supported anyway it should return success when
the device is physically not present already.
