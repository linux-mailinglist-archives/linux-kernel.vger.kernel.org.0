Usually when a controller could be used in more than one way, we
implement the more generic usecase. And that's what was done for MHU.
Implementing doorbell scheme would have disallowed mhu platforms that
don't have any shmem between the endpoints. Now such platforms could
use 32bits registers to pass/get data. Meanwhile doorbells could be
emulated in client code.
 Also, next version of MHU has many (100?) such 32bit registers per
interrupt. Clearly those are not meant to be seen as 3200 doorbells,
but as message passing windows. (or maybe that is an almost different
controller because of the differences)

BTW, this is not going to be the end of SCMI troubles (I believe
that's what his client is). SCMI will eventually have to be broken up
in layers (protocol and transport) for many legit platforms to use it.
That is mbox_send_message() will have to be replaced by, say,
platform_mbox_send()  in drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/driver.c  OR  the
platforms have to have shmem and each mailbox controller driver (that
could ever be used under scmi) will have to implement "doorbell
emulation" mode. That is the reason I am not letting the way paved for
such emulations.

Thanks
