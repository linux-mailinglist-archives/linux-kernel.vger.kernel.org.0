I would be more than surprised. Those false possitives were usually
papered over by using GFP_NOFS. And the original plan was to convert
those back to GFP_KERNEL like allocations and use __GFP_NOLOCKDEP.

I am glad to hear that because that was just too ugly to live.

No this just turned out to be unmaintainable. The number of lock classes
was growing high. I recommend on of the Dave Chinner's rant. Sorry not
link handy.

I haven't claimed that the lockdep is broken. It just had problems to
capture some code paths and generated false positives. I would recommend
talking to lockdep maintainers much more than to me because I would have
to dive into the code much more to be useful. I can still comment on the
MM side of the thing of course if that is helpful.

All you need is to generate a memory pressure. That shouldn't be that
hard.
