There is no nice interface I can think of. All options will just cause
more problems, inconsistencies, or annoyances.

Ideally, to not introduce more types of macros and keep it consistent,
ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_FIELDS_EXCEPT(var, ...) maybe what you're after:
"Check no concurrent writers to struct, except ignore the provided
fields".

This option doesn't quite work, unless you just restrict it to 1 field
(we can't use ranges, because e.g. vm_area_struct has
__randomize_layout). The next time around, you'll want 2 fields, and
it won't work. Also, do we know that 'shared.rb' is the only thing we
want to ignore?

If you wanted something similar to ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_BITS, it'd have to
be ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_FIELDS(var, ...), however, this is quite annoying
for structs with many fields as you'd have to list all of them. It's
similar to what you can already do currently (but I also don't
recommend because it's unmaintainable):

ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER(orig->vm_start);
ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER(orig->vm_end);
ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER(orig->vm_next);
ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER(orig->vm_prev);
... and so on ...
*new =3D data_race(*orig);

Also note that vm_area_struct has __randomize_layout, which makes
using ranges impossible. All in all, I don't see a terribly nice
option.

If, however, you knew that there are 1 or 2 fields only that you want
to make sure are not modified concurrently, ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER +
data_race() would probably work well (or even ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS
if you want to make sure there are no writers nor _readers_).

Thanks,
