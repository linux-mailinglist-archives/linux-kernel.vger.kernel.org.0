Our buffer security is implemented as part of our GPU's virtual memory
interface.  Our current proposed API is the set a "secure" flag when
memory is allocated and then when a process maps the buffer into its
GPU virtual address space, we set the appropriate flags in the PTEs.
See this series for more info:
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/66531/
You can have the buffers in whatever tiled or linear format makes
sense.  The encryption happens on top of that.  In order for the
various blocks on the GPU to be able to access the encrypted memory,
they need to be switched into "secure" mode.  So for example, if you
submit work to the GPU that included secure memory, you need to flag
that work as secure.  I don't think our solution is really shareable
outside of our asics so in our case, we don't really have to worry
about passing secure buffers between drivers.
