Thanks for the remind. Since we don't have an address I'm supposed we 
just need check if the vma's size is big enough or not other than other 
alignment check.

And, I'm wondering whether we could reuse transhuge_vma_suitable() by 
passing in an impossible address, i.e. -1 since it is not a valid 
userspace address. It can be used as and indicator that this call is 
from THPeligible context.

Will mark on my TODO list.

Where did this come from? From the commit log? If so it is the example 
for the wrong smap output. If that case really happens, I think we could 
document it since THPeligible should just show the current status.
