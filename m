It's been our experience that it's basically impossible to control for
memory without having it result in IO contention.

You acknowledge below that this effect may be noticable in some
situations. It's been our experience, however, that this effect is so
pronounced over a wide variety of workloads and host configurations
that exclusive memory control is not a practical application for
anything but niche cases - if they exist at all.

I said "isolation or containerization", and it really isn't a stretch
to see how the the intended isolation can break down in this example.

You could set an IO limit on the scape goat to keep it from inheriting
the higher IO priority from its parent.

But you could also just set a memory limit on the scape goat to keep
it from inheriting the higher memory allowance from the parent.

Between all this, I really don't see an argument here to make the
memory hierarchy semantics different from the other controllers.

Yes, either way works.

D is still the scape goat for B and C..?

Okay, hold on.

You wouldn't care about starving the rest of the system of IO and
CPU. But the objection to my patch is that you want to give memory
back to avoid undue burden on the rest of the system?

Can we please stop talking about such contrived hypotheticals and
discuss real computer systems that real people actually care about?

What about CPU and IO?

If you knew exactly that the scape goat doesn't need the memory, you
could set a memory limit on it - just like you could set a limit on
CPU and IO cycles to "give back" resources from inside a tree.

If you don't know exactly how much of the scape goat's memory is and
isn't needed, the additional paging risk from getting it wrong would
be to the detriment of both your workload and the rest of the system -
your attempt to be good to the rest of the system suddenly turns into
a negative-sum game.

I fundamentally do not understand the practical application of the
configuration you are arguing tooth and nail needs to be supported.

If this is a dealbreaker, surely in a month of discussion and 30+
emails, it should have been possible to come up with *one* example of
a real workload and host configuration for which the ability to
dissent from the hierarchical memory allocation (but oddly, not other
resources) is the *only* way to express working resource isolation.

As it stands, I have provided examples of real workloads and host
configs that can't be expressed with the current semantics. As such, I
would like to move ahead with my changes. They are gated behind a
mount option, so pose no risk to the elusive setups you envision. We
can always implement the inheritance scheme you propose once we have
concrete examples of real life scenarios that aren't otherwise doable,
but there is certainly not enough evidence to make me implement it now
as a condition for merging my patches.
