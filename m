One thing to note is that 'data_race()' points out concurrency, and
that somebody has deemed that the code won't break even with data
races. Somebody trying to understand or modify the code should ensure
this will still be the case. So, 'data_race()' isn't just tool cruft.
It's documentation for something that really isn't obvious from the
code alone.

Whenever we see a READ_ONCE or other marked access it is obvious to
the reader that there are concurrent accesses happening.  I'd argue
that for intentional data races, we should convey similar information,
to avoid breaking the code (of course KCSAN would tell you, but only
after the change was done). Even moreso, since changes to code
involving 'data_race()' will need re-verification that the data races
are still safe.

Still thinking about this.  What we want to convey is that, while
there are races on the particular variable, nobody should be modifying
the bits here. Adding a READ_ONCE (or data_race()) would miss a
harmful race where somebody modifies these bits, so in principle I
agree. However, I think the tool can't automatically tell (even if we
had compiler extensions to give us the bits accessed) which bits we
care about, because we might have something like:

int foo_bar =3D READ_ONCE(flags) >> FOO_BAR_SHIFT;  // need the
READ_ONCE because of FOO bits
.. (foo_bar & FOO_MASK) ..  // FOO bits can be modified concurrently
.. (foo_bar & BAR_MASK) ..  // nobody should modify BAR bits
concurrently though !

What we want is to assert that nobody touches a particular set of
bits. KCSAN has recently gotten ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_{WRITER,ACCESS}
macros which help assert properties of concurrent code, where bugs
won't manifest as data races. Along those lines, I can see the value
in doing an exclusivity check on a bitmask of a variable.

I don't know how much a READ_BITS macro could help, since it's
probably less ergonomic to have to say something like:
  READ_BITS(page->flags, ZONES_MASK << ZONES_PGSHIFT) >> ZONES_PGSHIFT.

Here is an alternative:

Let's say KCSAN gives you this:
   /* ... Assert that the bits set in mask are not written
concurrently; they may still be read concurrently.
     The access that immediately follows is assumed to access those
bits and safe w.r.t. data races.

     For example, this may be used when certain bits of @flags may
only be modified when holding the appropriate lock,
     but other bits may still be modified locklessly.
   ...
  */
   #define ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_BITS(flags, mask)   ....

Then we can write page_zonenum as follows:

static inline enum zone_type page_zonenum(const struct page *page)
 {
+       ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_BITS(page->flags, ZONES_MASK << ZONES_PGSHIFT);
        return (page->flags >> ZONES_PGSHIFT) & ZONES_MASK;
 }

This will accomplish the following:
1. The current code is not touched, and we do not have to verify that
the change is correct without KCSAN.
2. We're not introducing a bunch of special macros to read bits in various =
ways.
3. KCSAN will assume that the access is safe, and no data race report
is generated.
4. If somebody modifies ZONES bits concurrently, KCSAN will tell you
about the race.
5. We're documenting the code.

Anything I missed?

see it regularly for the last few weeks digging KCSAN reports, so even if i=
t is worth adding READ_BITS(), there are more equally important macros need=
 to be added together to be useful initially. For example, HARMLESS_COUNTER=
S(), READ_SINGLE_BIT(), READ_IMMUTATABLE_BITS() etc which Linus said exactl=
