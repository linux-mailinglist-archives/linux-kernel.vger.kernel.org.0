What part of the userspace would be managing the privacy screen? Should
there be a connection between the display and the privacy screen that
covers the display? How would the userspace make that connection if it's
a sysfs interface?

I don't know how the privacy screen operates, but if it draws any power,
you'll want to disable it when you switch off the display it covers.

If the privacy screen control was part of the graphics subsystem (say, a
DRM connector property, which feels somewhat natural), I think it would
make it easier for userspace to have policies such as enabling the
privacy screen automatically depending on the content you're viewing,
but only if the content is on the display that has a privacy screen.


BR,
Jani.
