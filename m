We can fix that by reserving mem_map capacity assuming the smallest
PAGE_SIZE across archs.

How does that lead to cross-arch incompatibility? Even on a single
arch the vmemmap area will be mapped with 2MB pages for 128MB aligned
spans of pmem address space and 4K pages for subsections.

Because that keeps the implementation from ever reaching a point where
a namespace might be able to be moved from one arch to another. If we
can squash these arch differences then we can have a common tool to
initialize namespaces outside of the kernel. The one wrinkle is
device-dax that wants to enforce the mapping size, but I think we can
have a module-option compatibility override for that case for the
admin to say "yes, I know this namespace is defined for 2MB x86 pages,
but I want to force enable it with 64K pages on PowerPC"
