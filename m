A few comments:

  - x86 starts the short log after the colon with an uppercase
    letter

  - 'macross' is really gross :)

  - All commits lack a Link:https//lore.kernel.org/r/$MSG-ID tag. That
    might be an oversight or just reflecting the fact that these patches
    have never seen a mailing list.

    If my brain hasn't gone into complete wishful thinking mode there is
    general consenus that we want to have visability and traceability of
    changes including those which come from maintainers for various good
    reasons (The obvious 'fix a typo breaking the build' exempted).

    Of course that's at your discretion.

From a quick check I can confirm that the resulting text changes are
just random noise and I did not notice anything horrible in the
generated code either.

See above.

Thanks,
