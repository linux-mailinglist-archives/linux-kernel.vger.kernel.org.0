try_lock would be more considerate. It would at least make any potential
hammering a bit harder.

It seems we do differ in the usefulness though. Using a crappy interface
for years doesn't make it less crappy. I do realize we cannot remove the
interface but we can remove issues with the implementation and I dare to
say that most existing users wouldn't really notice.

1a) and 2c) if you ask me.
