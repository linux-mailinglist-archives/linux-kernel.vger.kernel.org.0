This is the root of the problem. Journald should never turn on audit since it 
has no idea if auditd even has rules to load. What if the end user does not 
want auditing? By blindly enabling audit without knowing if its wanted, it 
causes a system performance hit even with no rules loaded. It would be best 
if journald leaves audit alone. If it wants to listen on the multicast 
socket, so be it. It should just listen and not try to alter the system.

Back to ntp, it sounds like the ntp record needs to check for audit_enabled 
rather than the dummy context.
