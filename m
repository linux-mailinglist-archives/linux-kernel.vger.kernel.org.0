If you need additional justification for why those are needed, here are
a few problematic scenarios we're observing in the current situation.
Feel free to use those if you need to add extra justification for your
audit patches commit messages.

A first scenario is a host with containers, where a container runs
userspace processes which depend on the open() behavior changed
by those sysctl. If the host is updated to systemd 241+, which enables
those sysctl by default, those containers will start misbehaving, and
figuring out the culprit without any hint in the kernel dmesg is far
from obvious.

A similar situation happens for non-containerized deployments. If an
application depends on this open() ABI behavior tweaked by those sysctl,
the application will start failing if it happens to run on a system
with systemd 241+. Again, without any dmesg printout, it's rather hard
to diagnose.

Thanks!

Mathieu
