I have started implementing a fix for this.
Right now I only performed tests on normal pages (non-hugetlb).

I took the approach of:

- Free page: remove it from the buddy allocator and set it as PageReserved|PageHWPoison.
- Used page: migrate it and do not release it (skip put_page in unmap_and_move for MR_MEMORY_FAILURE
	     reason). Set it as PageReserved|PageHWPoison.

The routine that handles this also sets the refcount of these pages to 1, so the unpoison
machinery will only have to check for PageHWPoison and to a put_page() to send
the page to the buddy allocator.

The Reserved bit is used because these pages will now __only__ be accessible through
pfn walkers, and pfn walkers should respect Reserved pages.
The PageHWPoison bit is used to remember that this page is poisoned, so the unpoison
machinery knows that it is valid to unpoison it.

It should also let us get rid of some if not all of the PageHWPoison() checks.

Overall, it seems to work as I no longer see the issue our customer and I faced.

My goal is to go further and publish that fix along with several
cleanups/refactors for the soft-offline machinery (hard-poison will come later),
as I strongly think we do really need to re-work that a bit, to make it more simple.

Since it will take a bit to have everything ready, I just wanted to
let you know.
