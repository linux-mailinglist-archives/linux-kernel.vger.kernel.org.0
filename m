Too late. The frontend saw closed and you already lost.

Why is this a problem? With this series fully applied a (block) backend can=
 come and go without needing to change the state. Relying on guests to DTRT=
 is not a sustainable option for a cloud deployment.

Why do we need that though? Why is it advantageous for a backend to go to c=
losed. No PV backends cope with an unbind as-is, and a toolstack initiated =
unplug will always set state to 5 anyway. So TBH any state transition done =
directly in the xenbus code looks wrong to me anyway (but appears to be a n=
ecessary evil to keep the toolstack working in the event it spawns a backen=
d where there is actually to driver present, or it doesn't come online).
