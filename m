What about replacing the warning with a WARN_ON_ONCE(in_irq()), would that
address your concern?

Also, considering this warning condition is most likely never occurring as we
know it, and we are considering deleting it soon enough, is it really worth
reimplementing the whole mechanism with a complex bit-sharing scheme just
because of the BH-disable condition you mentioned, which likely doesn't
happen today? In my implementation, this is just a simple counter. I feel
combining bits in the same counter will just introduce more complexity that
this patch tries to address/avoid.

OTOH, I also don't mind with just deleting the warning altogether if you are
Ok with that.

thanks!
