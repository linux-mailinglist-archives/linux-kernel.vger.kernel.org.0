Note, you should probably add a note in your change log that this issue was
found by Coverity. Sometimes static analyzers have a tag of some kind that
they would like patches that fix the issues they discover to be in the
change log. This way they can track the fixes that are found by the tool.

As I said in the other email, the above assignment still needs RCU
annotation:

		bt = rcu_dereference_protected(q->blk_trace,
				lockdep_is_held(&q->blk_trace_mutex));

Otherwise, other static analyzers will flag this as a problem.
