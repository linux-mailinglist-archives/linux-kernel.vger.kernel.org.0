Something went wrong (mainly with me pressing wrong buttons), so I
managed to pull the conversation off the list. I'd duplicate my
answers here with comments from Mark, first being:

True, would re-phrase to description.

This is what I'm puzzled about - which style to use for the file
header since the introduction of SPDX and a rule that it should be
"C++ style" commented for source files and "C style" for header files.
After this introduction, should the more-or-less standard header be
also done in C++ style? I saw different source files are doing
different things... But all-in-all I would follow you advise here with
converting entire block to C++.

[Mark]: The only thing SPDX cares about is the first line, the making
the rest of the block a C++ one is mostly a preference I have.

Got it, would be done!

That was done for "macro convenience". I would definitely re-work this part.

Agreed, would be re-worked as well.

This is a tricky point. Since there is no datasheet available from
Intel on this IP - I went with a safe option of taking this part from
original Intel patch, which they did for Aero board as the range was
described there in exactly this way. I am totally unsure if the
regulator does not provide all voltages, or this limit is purely
artificial here. Nevertheless, according to SD specification this
regulator should only operate with only those two voltage levels: 1v8
and 3v3 and consumers (mmc) should be well aware of this.

[Mark]: There's always the possibility that someone builds a board
with something else attached to the regulator if they don't want to
use SD cards for example.

I would re-work this to map all voltage ranges here properly, so there
would be no further confusions.

Above those two points above: I totally agree this is not the
regulator configuration but rather a specific board one. The only
thing I was not able to locate is a correct board file to put this
into.

Maybe you or Hans can guide me here on where to have this code as best?

[Mark]: I *think* drivers/platform/x86 might be what you're looking
for but I'm not super familiar with x86.  There's also
arch/x86/platform but I think they're also trying to push things out
of arch/.

Yes, this is actually a get_status. Would re-work it.

I'd revise the whole regulator core API usage from comments above, as
I see now the driver code could be simplified dramatically.

Yes, you're absolutely right, I've missed this one out. Would use a
proper API here as well.

Yeap, and consecutively devm_regulator_unregister() in
cht_wc_regulator_remove call.

[Mark]: With devm_ you don't even need to explicitly unregister so the
entire remove function can go.

Got it, would correct this as well.

Overall, I would definitely work on a v2 here for both the regulator
and mfd cell part. If anyone has additional comment - please share
them here so I would gladly take them in!

Thanks a lot to all of you for reviewing this set!
