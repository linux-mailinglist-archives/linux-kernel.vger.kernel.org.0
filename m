Fatally flawed because it does not handle modules that add a consumer
device when the module is loaded.

Please do nitpick.  Clarity is good.

The example you gave does not cover all use cases.

There are modules that add devices when the module is loaded.  You can not
ignore systems using such modules.

And the sync_state() call back will not deal with modules that add consumer
devices when the module is loaded, correct?

Only some modules add devices when they are loaded.  But these modules do
exist.
