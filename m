I may have misinterpreted Christian[1], but I interpreted the below as
meaning that he'd prefer the caller (drm_sched_main()) to handle the
drm_sched_start_timeout() in this case:

I wasn't entirely sure if it was safe to leave the timeout running while
the job free was going on which would be the case if
drm_sched_get_cleanup_job() re-armed unconditionally.

There's a loop round the code in drm_sched_main():

	while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
		[...]
		wait_event_interruptible(...)

		while (cleanup_job) {...}

		if (!entity)
			continue;

		[...]
	}

So after handling the cleanup_job case, the outer loop will loop back
round to the wait_event_interruptible() call. One other concern is
whether it's possible for the thread to be signalled to stop before the
clean up has been completed. The while loop I added ensures that all
jobs are actually cleaned up before kthread_should_stop() is checked.
