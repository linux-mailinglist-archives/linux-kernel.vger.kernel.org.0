Alright. Maybe a full example will help. See below. I think I understand
how it's supposed to look.

I don't know. I think this binding patch will go for another round so
maybe it's blocked in other ways?

Got it.

Here's the same example that hopefully shows how all this stuff can
work. I've added more nonsense to try and make it as complicated as
possible.
