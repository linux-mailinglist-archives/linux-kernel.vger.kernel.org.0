Matthew pointed out that having a hook in NVS driver is better solution
because it is nil functionality if the TPM driver is loaded. We need
functions to:

1. Request a region from the NVS driver (when tpm_crb loads)
2. Release a region back to the NVS Driver (when tpm_crb unloads).

My proposal would unnecessarily duplicate code and also leave a
side-effect when TPM is not used in the first place.

I see this as the overally best solution. If you can come up with a
patch for the NVS side and changes to CRB drivers to utilize the new
hooks, then combined with Vanya's changes we have a sustainable solution
for AMD fTPM.
