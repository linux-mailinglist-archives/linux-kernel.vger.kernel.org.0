Actually, even back then I said that it would be best to merge all the
tools into one (I just didn't have the time to implement it), and then
we could pull this off. I have one of my developers working to merge
record-mcount into objtool now (there's been some patches floating
around).

Then with a single tool, it shouldn't be controversial.
