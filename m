I can send my test-case which is a trivial open-read-close loop with one
thread per CPU and increasing read sizes.

The issue is not limited to SMT, it also shows without SMT.

I completely agree with 2). Nevertheless limiting the retry attempts
like Linus suggested looks like a fair change that should not penalize
anyone and would still help the contented case.
