I'm fine with restricting CFR to very simple cases, at least initially.
We can always expand it later once the need becomes clear.

That said, we should probably add a comment explaining why we're
excluding cases where the stripe count != 1 here. It doesn't need to
contain the whole commit log message you wrote, but anyone that does
want to improve this later might appreciate some breadcrumbs.

Maybe something like:

/*
 * Striped file layouts require that we copy partial objects,
 * but the OSD copy-from operation only supports full-object copies.
 * Limit this to non-striped file layouts for now.
 */

If that sounds ok, I'll add that in and merge this later today.

Thanks,
