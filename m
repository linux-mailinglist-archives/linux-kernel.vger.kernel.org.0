Most Google kernel work is "work for hire" from what I have heard.

But the copyright of the patch really doesn't matter if the patch is
under the GPLv2 (obviously here), then anyone can send it in and put
their s-o-b on it.  The fact that it's someone from the same company is
good enough to let us know who to track down and kick if something
breaks with the patch, which is all we really need :)

hope this helps,
