Sorry for not being more clear.   The error was discovered while discussing a
proposal to change a use of release_pages() to put_user_pages()[1]

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190523172852.GA27175@iweiny-DESK2.sc.intel.com/

In that thread John was saying that release_pages() was functionally equivalent
to a loop around put_page().  He also suggested implementing put_user_pages()
by using release_pages().  On the surface they did not seem the same to me so I
did a deep dive to make sure they were and found this error.

This is not failing release_pages().  The fix is that not all devmap pages are
"public" type.  So previous to this change devmap pages of other types would
not correctly be accounted for.

The discussion about put_devmap_managed_page() "failing" is not about it
failing directly but rather in how these pages should be accounted for.  Only
devmap pages which require pagemap ops (specifically page_free()) require
put_devmap_managed_page() processing.   Because of the optimized locking in
release_pages() the zone device check is required to release the lock even if
put_devmap_managed_page() does not handle the put.

I think what has happened is the code in release_pages() and put_page()
diverged at some point.  I think it is worth a clean up in this area but I
don't see way to do it at the moment which would be any cleaner than what is
there.  So I've refrained from doing so.

Does this help?  Would you like to roll a V3 with some of this in the commit
message?
