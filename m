Thinking more about this, I don't think it's worth holding back the
entire series trying to solve the cyclic dependencies.

At least as of today, the clock framework has a hack (hack because it
expects globally unique clock names that causes problems for some
corner cases) that allows the supplier (the one that gets a few clocks
from the consumers) to get away with not listing the consumer clocks
in the supplier's clock list. So, the SDM845 avoid cycles in DT
(despite having them in the hardware) that way.

So we can take our time trying to solve this in a generic fashion (new
DT property/binding, edit_links(), letting devices probe, etc). In the
meantime, maybe we'll run into more cycle issues that'll give us a
better idea of which solution would be better as a generic solution.

I'll send a new patch series addressing the concern about
platfom_device and dropping the attempt to solve cycles.

Thanks,
Saravana
