Yeah the sentence is a bit convoluted, I agree. As for the fix, see

Fair enough, this is simpler.

Of course. I'm travelling this week (which is why I somewhat rushed
sending you the patches last week, hence the glitches you noted), so I
won't have a chance to repost until sometime next week.

No worries. It's not super important, it's a minor thing I noticed
while testing (when I artifically make my consoles not match to test
the "default" fallback). It's not directly related to the fix in patch
2, but is completely standlaone.
