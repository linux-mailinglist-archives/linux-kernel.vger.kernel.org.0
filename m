This doesn't really answer my question. What I understand is that your
system is laid out like this:

     DEVICES -> ARMCTL -> CPUs
                  ^
                 GIC

How are the various GIC outputs mapped into the ARMCTL? It has 4 of
them per CPU (IRQ/FIQ + vIRQ/vFIQ), which the ARMCTL must somehow map
to its own interrupts, specially if you want to signal IPIs using the
GIC's SGIs (to which you hint in the commit log).

There is a link I'm missing here.

That's usually done with a hierarchy, where the ARMCTL IC would be a
child of the GIC and see all interrupt configuration calls before they
reach the GIC driver. We have plenty of examples in the tree already.

Thanks,
