Please read his prev email once again. The issue can happen before icache sync can
do the magic. Code update involves updating both dcache and icache lines. Further
dcache update is propagated by hardware (cache coh unit) while icache by Linux
cross core IPI calls. However the potential race is when the patching core's
dcache flush is propagated to other core, but icache cross call is not not
seen/executed by other core and that core also happens to be executing around the
region of code being patched - such that of the 2 icache lines involved, 1 exists
already (old) but the other doesn't (evicted a while back) so fetches the new line
- as a result the 2 icache lines don't correspond to same instruction.

We do, hopefully now u do too ;-)

As you mention below EI_s takes an index into jump table. Simplistically each jump
label would correspond to a unique indexes, how do we assign unique indexs for
these instances. Remember we define the macro just once in a header as follows

| static inline bool arch_static_branch_jump(struct static_key *key, bool branch)
| {
|	asm_volatile_goto("1:\n\t"
|		 "b_s %l[l_yes]\n\t"
|		 ".pushsection __jump_table,  \"aw\"\n\t"
|		 ".word 1b, %l[l_yes], %c0\n\t"
|		 ".popsection\n\t"
|		 : :  "i" (&((char *)key)[branch]) :  : l_yes);
|
|	return false;
|l_yes:
|	return true;
|}

Do we have a gcc asm constraint etc to achieve that. IMO EI_S is useful for
baremetal hand written pure asm code, not so much as targeted by compiler proper.

You mean the whole jump label framework is useless.

How about looking at real code, rather than speculating about the merits of kernel
developers: I can understand u have reservations about our meritocracy, but this
feature was done by smarter folks ;-)

The function below is used in hot schedular path:

u64 sched_clock_cpu(int cpu)
{
	if (!static_branch_unlikely(&sched_clock_running))
		return 0;

	return sched_clock();
}

Here it reads a flag every call

80304194 <sched_clock_cpu>:
80304194:	ld	r2,[0x80713a00]
8030419c:	brge.nt	r2,0x1,12	;803041a8 <sched_clock_cpu+0x14>
803041a0:	mov_s	r0,0
803041a2:	j_s.d	[blink]
803041a4:	mov_s	r1,0
803041a6:	nop_s
803041a8:	b	266756	;803453ac <sched_clock>

With jump label we replace the LD with a nop as that is more likely to be true.

800562f8 <sched_clock_cpu>:
800562f8:	nop
800562fc:	mov_s	r0,0
800562fe:	j_s.d	[blink]
80056300:	mov_s	r1,0
80056302:	nop_s
80056304:	b	257676	;80095190 <sched_clock>

There is in-kernel JIT compiler already, used for bigger code chunks, not so much
for 2 or 4 bytes: every use case is different.
