There is another use case I see for this functionality: There are ways 
for user space to upgrade the TPM's firmware via /dev/tpm0 (using e.g. 
TPM2_FieldUpgradeStart/TPM2_FieldUpgradeData). While upgrading, the 
normal TPM functionality might not be available (commands return 
TPM_RC_UPGRADE or other error codes). Even after the upgrade is 
finished, the TPM might continue to refuse command execution (e.g. with 
TPM_RC_REBOOT).

I'm not sure whether all in-kernel users are prepared to deal correctly 
with those error codes. But even if they are, it might be better to 
block them from sending commands in the first place, to not interfere 
with the upgrade process.

What would you think about a way for a user space upgrade tool to also 
set this flag, to make the TPM unavailable for everything but the 
upgrade process?
