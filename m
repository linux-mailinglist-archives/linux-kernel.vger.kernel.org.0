That's fine, we have loads of drivers that work on different types of
busses.

Or, if this really is the "platform bus" then use that.  (which is what
I was hinting at all along but no one seems to realize that, should have
been more obvious...)

Of course it is, but it controls a bus, and there are devices on that
bus, right?  Don't circumvent things please.
