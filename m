I went digging. This is absolutely repeatable. I checked that I do not unknowingly have CAP_SYS_NICE as a user. So 
first, are we tying latency_nice to CAP_SYS_NICE? Seems like a reasonable thing, but not sure I saw this stated 
anywhere. Second, the only capability checked in __sched_setscheduler() in the patch I have is CAP_SYS_NICE and those 
checks will not return a -EPERM for a negative latency_tolerance (in the code, aka latency_nice). Do I have the correct 
version of the code? Am I missing something?
