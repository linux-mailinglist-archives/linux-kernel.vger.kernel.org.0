I'm not entirely clear what you're suggesting, so I'll just pick the
scenario that I think you're talking about - but I'm not sure it's the
one you're intending.

Using test_bit() in one thread and set_bit() on the same bit in another
thread without locking is going to be racy by definition.  It's entirely
possible for:

	Thread 1			Thread 2
	bit = test_bit(...);
					set_bit(...);
	/* use bit */

and here, bit == 0 but the bit has been set by thread 2.  Use of the
result from test_bit() is inherently a non-atomic operation.

This is why we have test_and_set_bit() and friends that atomically test
that a bit is clear before setting it.  Where this is especially
important is for some filesystems, as they use test_and_xxx_bit() to
manage their allocation bitmaps.
