But this can be changed if that make the statistic useful

I don't really like this patch because it adds yet another metrics and
yet another feature which is set true by default. Also the current
proposal seems a bit fragile because it uses an arbitrary ratio of 2
on an arbitrary number of CPUs. This threshold probably works in your
case and your system but probably not for others and the threshold
really looks like a heuristic that works for you but without any real
meaning.

Then, the update is done at each and every task wake up and by all
CPUs in the LLC. It means that the same variable is updated
simultaneously by all CPUs: one CPU can set it and the next one might
clear it immediately because they haven't scanned the same CPUs. At
the end, 2 threads waking up simultaneously on different CPUS, might
end up using 2 different policy without any other reason than a random
ordering.

I agree that the concept of detecting that a LLC domain is overloaded
can be useful to decide to skip searching for an idle cpu but this
proposal seems to be not really generic
