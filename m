Yes it's a problem. I suppose we could take the parent's init_mutex
(making sure that it protects detach_dev() as well.

First I need to figure out how to prevent the parent domain from
disappearing when auxiliary domains are attached, I seem to have forgotten
that. I think checking if AUXD is enabled in the device passed to
attach_dev() should be sufficient - that's what I do for SVA. But the
IOMMU API isn't quite ready to handle failure in iommu_detach_device() at
the moment. VFIO will free the domain even if it's still attached.

->capable isn't very useful because it applies to all SMMUs in the
system. The existing ->{get,set}_attr callbacks apply to an
iommu_domain. The main reason for doing it on endpoints was that it
would be tedious to keep track of capabilities when attaching and
detaching devices to a domain, especially for drivers that allow
multiple IOMMUs per domain [1]. There were more discussions, and in the
end Joerg proposed the current API for device attributes [2]
