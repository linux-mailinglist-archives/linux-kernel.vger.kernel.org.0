You reduce the text size by a constant amount, at the cost of allocating 
twice as much runtime data per clock (struct action_devres  vs. void*). 
Assuming 64-bit pointers, that means that in principle your ~320-byte 
saving would be cancelled out at ~40 managed clocks. However, that's 
also assuming that the minimum allocation granularity is no larger than 
a single pointer, which generally isn't true, so in reality it depends 
on whether the difference in data pushes the total struct devres 
allocation over the next ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN boundary - if it doesn't, 
the difference comes entirely for free; if it does, the memory cost 
tradeoff gets even worse.
