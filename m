I agree this setting is a bit confusing because DDR nature. What we have
with HyperFlash in DDR mode is equivalent to 16bit flash on a 8bit bus
and kind of equal to 2 bus cycles (in this case clock edges), therefore
bandwidth would turn out to be 2. Otherwise cfi_build_cmd() would
generate wrong addresses and simple map implmention of read/writes would
use wrong accessors.
Only way I see map->bankwidth = 1 working is if HF is used in SDR mode.
So is Cogent's HF in SDR mode? I thought HyperFlash is DDR only but I
may be wrong.
