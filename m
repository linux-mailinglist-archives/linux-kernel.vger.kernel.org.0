Admittedly I am not super fond of this solution either. But
leaving the PM runtime active is basically what this patch does
(well the mfd part). Leaving the PM runtime enabled means access
to the DCVDD regulator is required during the remove process,
which in turn means you need to put that regulator after the
other devices are removed but before DCVDD is removed. Currently
the only place we can do that is in the LDO remove, as per this
patch.

Other options that might be viable, pending input for yourself
and Lee:

1) We could look at adding a partial remove function to MFD.
Currently I can only call mfd_remove_devices which nobbles all
the devices. If I could make calls to remove specific devices I
could do one call to remove everything except DCVDD, do the put,
then remove the regulator.

2) We could look at adding some sort of pre-remove callback into
MFD, and the regulator put could go in there rather than the
regulator remove, as per this patch. Although this feels a little
like the same thing as this patch, just dressed up a little
differently.

3) We could look at doing something in regmap IRQ to change when
it does PM runtime calls, it is regmap doing runtime gets when
drivers remove IRQs that causes the issue. But my accessment was
that what regmap is doing makes perfect sense, so I don't think
this is a good approach.

Apologies yes that is a good point. If no one minds, and we end
up sticking with this approach, I feel it might best to squash
them both back into one patch?

Thanks,
Charles
