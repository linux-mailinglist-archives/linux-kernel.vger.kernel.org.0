The ISL68137 is part of the first generation of our digital multiphase
parts which are all exclusively 2-rail (2-page) devices. There are a
couple of reasons that we are opting for a new driver for the new
generation of devices:

1) Gen 2 has multiple rail configurations (1, 2, or 3) with different scaling
parameters than Gen 1
2) We are planning to support some of the non-generic PMBus functions of
the Gen 2 devices using the debugfs interface.

I am currently working on point 2 and those features are not
quite ready to be included in a patch set but we wanted to move forward
with the hwmon functionality for now as that is useful on it's own.

Fair point on the global vs paged commands. I will modify the page
functions so that global commands are only read from page 0.

Thank you,
Grant
