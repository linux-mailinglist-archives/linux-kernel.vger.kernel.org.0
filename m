Now that we are done with cleanups, we can start fixing the code with
actual semantic or functional changes.

This patchset corrects issues with Intel BIOS and hardware properties
that prevented a successful init, aligns the code with the MIPI DisCo
spec, adds rate-limiting for frequent errors and adds checks on number
of links and PDIs.

With all these changes, the hardware can be initialized correctly and
modules can be added/removed without issues on WhiskyLake and
IceLake.

Parts of this code was initially written by my Intel colleagues Vinod
Koul, Sanyog Kale, Shreyas Nc and Hardik Shah, who are either no
longer with Intel or no longer involved in SoundWire development. When
relevant, I explictly added a note in commit messages to give them
credit for their hard work, but I removed their signed-off-by tags to
avoid email bounces and avoid spamming them forever with SoundWire
patches.

Changes since v2:
Feedback from Vinod:
1. improve the SoundWire controller search without magic values
2. split patches as needed
Other additions
rate-limiting to avoid flooding dmesg logs
provide better Slave status on errors
more checks on links and PDIs
