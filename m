I've given these a spin on my yoga c630, which uses the same bridge, so:

Tested-by: Rob Clark <robdclark@gmail.com>

I've got one small fixup for a compiler warning for the 2nd to last,
and with that, the first 8 are:

Reviewed-by: Rob Clark <robdclark@gmail.com>

I've also got a fixup for the last one which reads
SUPPORTED_LINK_RATES.  However the panel I have is pre eDP 1.4, so the
interesting codepath there is untested.  Not sure offhand if the
panels you have are eDP 1.4+ or not?
