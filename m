I have no strong opinions. What matters to me, is that people agree on
the best option, based on a case by case discussion.

history invasive. Simply adding some documentation is enough.

Sounds like documentation is what people prefer here - and the DT doc
seems already fine in regards to that.

Perhaps some more words added to the header in driver's c-file could
be and option to consider, as today it only mentions "JZ4740 SD/MMC
controller driver".

Anyway, it's up to you. :-)

Kind regards
