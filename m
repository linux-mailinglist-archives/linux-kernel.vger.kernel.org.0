okay, will patch it to
#define MXIC_CMD_POWER_DOWN 0xB9

okay, patch it with this sentence, thanks.

okay, will patch the second sentence based on your comments.
i.e,.

 /*
  * Toggle #CS pin to resume NAND device and don't care
  * of the others CLE, #WE, #RE pins status.
  * A NAND controller ensure it is able to assert/de-assert #CS
  * by sending any byte over the NAND bus.
  * i.e.,
  * NAND power down command or reset command.

yes, sure !

okay, will patch it.
