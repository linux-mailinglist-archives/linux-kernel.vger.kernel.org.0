Changed it to around 20 samples and the tests look fine. Updated patch below (v5) :

From: "Joel Fernandes (Google)" <joel@joelfernandes.org>
Subject: [PATCH] rcuperf: Measure memory footprint during kfree_rcu() test (v5)

During changes to kfree_rcu() code, we often check the amount of free
memory.  As an alternative to checking this manually, this commit adds a
measurement in the test itself.  It measures four times during the test
for available memory, digitally filters these measurements to produce a
running average with a weight of 0.5, and compares this digitally
filtered value with the amount of available memory at the beginning of
the test.

We apply the digital filter only once we are more than 25% into the
test. At the 25% mark, we just read available memory and don't apply any
filtering. This prevents the first sample from skewing the results
as we would not consider memory readings that were before memory was
allocated.

A sample run shows something like:

Total time taken by all kfree'ers: 6369738407 ns, loops: 10000, batches: 764, memory footprint: 216MB

---
v1->v2: Minor corrections
v1->v3: Use long long to prevent 32-bit system's overflow
	Handle case where some threads start later than others.
	Start measuring only once 25% into the test. Slightly more accurate.
v3->v4: Simplified test more. Using simple average.
v4->v5: Collect more memory samples than previous revision (4 to 5, vs, 20 to 21).
