Good to have that confirmed -- thanks for verifying.

Ack, some more explanation would be a good idea here.

Maybe the following comments are sufficient?

	/* We rely on the above assingment to initialise dst's thread_flags: */

and

	/*
	 * Detach src's sve_state (if any) from dst so that it does not
	 * get erroneously used or freed prematurely.  dst's sve_state
	 * will be allocated on demand later on if dst uses SVE.

(TIF_SVE should not usually be set in the first place of course, since
we are in a fork() or clone() syscall in src.  This may not be true if
a task is created using kernel_thread() while running in the context of
some user task that entered the kernel due to a trap or syscall --
though probably nobody should be doing that.)
