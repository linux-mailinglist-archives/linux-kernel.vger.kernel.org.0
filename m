Right, I'm not too worried about the implementation issues before we
settle on the architectural issues. Those are easy to fix.

Honestly, the main points that the maintainers raised are:
1) This is a configuration property and not describing the device.
Just use the implicit dependencies coming from existing bindings.

I gave a bunch of reasons for why I think it isn't an OS configuration
property. But even if that's not something the maintainers can agree
to, I gave a concrete example (cyclic dependencies between clock
provider hardware) where the implicit dependencies would prevent one
of the devices from probing till the end of time. So even if the
maintainers don't agree we should always look at "depends-on" to
decide the dependencies, we still need some means to override the
implicit dependencies where they don't match the real dependency. Can
we use depends-on as an override when the implicit dependencies aren't
correct?

2) This doesn't need to be solved because this is just optimizing
probing or saving power ("we should get rid of this auto disabling"):

I explained why this patch series is not just about optimizing probe
ordering or saving power. And why we can't ignore auto disabling
(because it's more than just auto disabling). The kernel is currently
broken when trying to use modules in ARM SoCs (probably in other
systems/archs too, but I can't speak for those).

3) Concerns about backwards compatibility

I pointed out why the current scheme (depends-on being the only source
of dependency) doesn't break compatibility. And if we go with
"depends-on" as an override what we could do to keep backwards
compatibility. Happy to hear more thoughts or discuss options.

4) How the "sync_state" would work for a device that supplies multiple
functionalities but a limited driver.

I explained how it would work.

Yes, the 3 maintainers brought up their concerns and I replied to
explain my viewpoint on their concerns. So I'm waiting for a response
from them before I proceed further. Even if the response is going to
be "we still don't agree with this architecture", I'd prefer at least
some direction on what the maintainers think is the right
architecture. There are a million different ways to solve this. It's
not reasonable to expect people submitting patches to shoot in the
dark and hope it hits what the maintainers have in their mind as
"acceptable solutions". I even proposed some alternatives. So, it'd be
nice to hear the maintainers' thoughts on my responses, alternative
designs or some alternate proposals.

There's a real problem that needs to be solved. Just saying "I don't
like this solution" without suggesting alternatives isn't a
constructive way to improve the kernel.

I'd be happy to and I've been thinking about other ways, but I'd like
some direction from the maintainers before writing a lot of code
that's just going to be completely rejected.

To summarize the options:
1) Use depends-on as the only source of dependency (this patch series)
- Easy to keep backward compatible
- Handles all cases
- Arguable that this is OS configuration

2) Use existing bindings for dependencies, but use "depends-on" for
overriding cases that are incorrect.
- New kernel not backward compatible with old DT. So devices will stop
booting or won't have full functionality.
- Needs some scheme to disabling all dependency tracking to be
backward compatible.
  a) Can have the dependency linking code under CONFIG_XXXXX
  b) Can have a kernel commandline
  c) NEW alternative to CONFIG_XXXX or commandline. Can have an
additional "implicit-dependencies-are-explicit-too" DT property that
can be added to the "choosen" DT node to tell the OS that the implicit
dependencies are valid real dependencies too. Then if they need
overrides, depends-on can be used. So old DT blobs would effectively
have this feature disabled.
- Handles all cases
- Only (c) above could be argued as OS configuration. But I'd argue
that it's clarifying the DT dependencies to be more explicit.

Thanks,
Saravana
