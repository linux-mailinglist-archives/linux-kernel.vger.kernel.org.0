The llist_add() and llist_del_all() are just simple helpers. Because
this lockless case involve synchronization of two variables, the llist
helpers do not directly apply here. So the rests cannot be used. It will
look awkward it is partially converted to use the helpers. If we convert
to use a lock as suggested by Michal, using the helpers will be an
overkill as xchg() will not be needed.
