Subject: [PATCH v5 0/3] perf report: Support annotation of code without symbols

For perf report on stripped binaries it is currently impossible to do
annotation. The annotation state is all tied to symbols, but there are
either no symbols, or symbols are not covering all the code.

We should support the annotation functionality even without symbols.

The first patch uses al_addr to print because it's easy to dump
the instructions from this address in binary for branch mode.

The second patch supports the annotation on stripped binary.

The third patch supports the hotkey 'a' on address for annotation.

 v5:
 ---
 Separate the hotkey 'a' implementation to a new patch
 "perf report: Support hotkey 'a' on address for annotation"

 v4:
 ---
 1. Support the hotkey 'a'. When we press 'a' on address,
    now it supports the annotation.

 2. Change the patch title from
    "Support interactive annotation of code without symbols" to
    "perf report: Support interactive annotation of code without symbols"

 v3:
 ---
 Keep just the ANNOTATION_DUMMY_LEN, and remove the
 opts->annotate_dummy_len since it's the "maybe in future
 we will provide" feature.

 v2:
 ---
 Fix a crash issue when annotating an address in "unknown" object.

Jin Yao (3):
  perf util: Print al_addr when symbol is not found
  perf report: Support interactive annotation of code without symbols
  perf report: Support hotkey 'a' on address for annotation
