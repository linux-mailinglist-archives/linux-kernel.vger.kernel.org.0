Not a bad idea, though it means more overhead for the vfree case.

Since we're spitballing here...could we have kvfree figure out whether
it's running in a context where it would need to queue it instead and
only do it in that case?

We currently have to figure that out for the might_sleep_if anyway. We
could just have it DTRT instead of printk'ing and dumping the stack in
that case.
