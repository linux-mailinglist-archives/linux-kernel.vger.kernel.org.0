Reading the flag IS lock protected, just spread across two functions.
 For performance, ima_post_key_create_or_update() checks
ima_process_keys, before calling ima_queue_key(), which takes the
mutex before checking ima_process_keys again.

As long as both the reader and writer, take the mutex before checking
the flag, the locking is fine.  The additional check, before taking
the mutex, is simply for performance.
