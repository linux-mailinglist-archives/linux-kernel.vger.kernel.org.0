I /think/ %P is the proper option, because the /usr/sbin/coredump process
should (??) be created in the initial PID namespace.

Tangent: if a process is created in a different PID namespace, does it also
have a "global" PID, or is it "invisible" in the "root" PID namespace?

What about /proc/[pid] ? (breakpad needs these bits)

I'm still not 100% sure about how to access the /proc/[pid] directory of
a process that crashed in a new PID namespace FROM a coredump analyzer
in the root PID namespace.

Regards.
