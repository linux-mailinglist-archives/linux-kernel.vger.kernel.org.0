I thought I did reply -- not sure what part you are looking for so
I'll rephrase. I was just picking the SD card controller as a concrete
example of device that can work with or without an interrupt. But
sure, I can call it "the device".

And yes, the device won't have a "depends-on" on the IRQ provider
because the device can still work without a working (as in bound to
driver) IRQ provider. Whether the driver insists on waiting on an IRQ
provider or not is up to the driver and the depends-on property is NOT
trying to dictate what the driver should do in this case. Does that
answer your implied question?

I agree -- which is why the current implementation doesn't try to form
mandatory dependency from implicit bindings and makes the case that
all mandatory dependencies should be called out explicitly. But if
people insist on that implicit bindings be used as such, then a CONFIG
or commandline option would be an acceptable compromise for me.

Just want to point out that, as of today, we have a broken system --
module loading is not compatible with proper handling of shared
mandatory resources during boot up. To be clear, I'm not arguing for a
commandline arg.

Sounds good.
