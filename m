I'm not seeking remuneration for the information, nor suggesting any 
specific attorney, nor will I profit from this is any way. Many of the 
programmers are completely unaware of their rights regarding their works 
of authorship and the FSF, SFLC and whomever else have been spreading 
misleading information. They deserve to know the truth so their works 
are not, effectively, converted, while they are cast aside.

As a BSD-grrl you probably have ample experience with such misleading 
statements from said outlets in the past, again and again and again and 
again.

As for whatever the webhost DNS string means: I don't keep up with 
social media.
