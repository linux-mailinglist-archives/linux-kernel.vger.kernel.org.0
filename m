In SoundWire parlance, both 'Slave' and 'Master' are 'Devices', so yes 
we do in the standard talk about 'Slave Devices' and 'Master Devices'.

Then we have Linux 'Devices' which can be used for both.

If we use 'sdw_slave', would we be referring to the actual physical part 
or the Linux device?

FWIW the Greybus example used 'Host Device' and 'hd' as shortcut.

yes, but there is no such operation as 'Master Release' in SoundWire.
At least the 'md' shortcut conveys the implicit convention that this is 
a Linux device only.

I really would like to avoid overloading the standard definitions with 
the Linux ones...

as explained this is to avoid errors at a later point. I don't see any 
harm in providing error checks for a routine that can only be used for 1 
of the 3 devices defined in the standard?

There is currently no bus device object, see the structure definition 
it's a pointer to a device (which leads to all sorts of issues because 
we can't use container_of).

when the master device gets added, that's where the Linux device is 
created and the pointer saved in the bus structure, with IIRC 
sdw_add_bus_master().


  	ret = sdw_add_bus_master(&sdw->cdns.bus);
