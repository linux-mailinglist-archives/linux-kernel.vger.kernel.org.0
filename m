That's the basic dilemma. We need to know whether we'll need to delete
the block before taking the blocked_lock_lock.

Your most recent patch used the return code from the wait to determine
this, but that's not 100% reliable (as Neil pointed out). Could we try
to do this by doing the delete only when we get certain error codes?
Maybe, but that's a bit fragile-sounding.

Neil's most recent patch used presence on the fl_blocked_requests list
to determine whether to take the lock, but that relied on some very
subtle memory ordering. We could of course do that, but that's a bit
brittle too.

That's the main reason I'm leaning toward the patch Neil sent
originally and that uses the fl_wait.lock. The existing alternate lock
managers (nfsd and lockd) don't use fl_wait at all, so I don't think
doing that will cause any issues.
