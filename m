Ah, gotcha.  I tried to do this in the final paragraph of my amedment to 
Wei's patch and why it's important that this is marked as stable.

The current code in 5.4 from commit 87eaceb3faa59 places any migrated 
compound page onto the deferred split queue of the destination memcg 
regardless of whether it has a mapping pmd 
(list_empty(page_deferred_list()) was already false) or it does not have a 
mapping pmd (but is now on the wrong queue).  For the latter, 
can_split_huge_page() can help for the actual split but not for the 
removal of the page that is now erroneously on the queue.  For the former, 
memcg reclaim would not see the pages that it should split under memcg 
pressure so we'll see the same memcg oom conditions we saw before the 
deferred split shrinker became SHRINKER_MEMCG_AWARE: unnecessary ooms.
