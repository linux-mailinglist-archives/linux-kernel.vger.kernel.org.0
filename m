Heiko,

     Could you help to just pick the first patch and drop the other 2 
patches?

     I think it's better to fix in the U-Boot first so that the 
stability issue will be fixed,

and the update in kernel dts is not so urgent for kernel driver actually 
not setting

this pwm regulator.

     I want to add a patch for rk3399-roc-pc, since Markus Reichl 
already send it,

so it's OK for that board, and for rock960/Ficus, the vdd_log is removed 
for stability

issue, then we have to update U-Boot first before kernel can add the 
vdd_log back.


Thanks,

- Kever
