You will wake up faster as well when running at MAX_OPP because
instructions will run faster or at least as fast. That being said,
running twice faster doesn't mean at all waking up twice faster but
for sure it will be faster although the gain can be really short.
Whereas running on a big core with more capacity doesn't mean that you
will wake up faster because of uarch difference.
I agree that "long" running rt task will most probably benefit from
big cores to complete earlier but that no more obvious for short one.

That's the point of my comment, choosing big cores as default and
always best choice is far from being obvious.
And this patch changes the default behavior without study of the
impact apart from stating that this should be ok
