Yes.  This is another common philosophy.  And MADV_FREE pages is
different from caches such as the page caches because it has no valid
contents.  And this patchset doesn't disable MADV_FREE mechanism.  It
just change the migration behavior.  So MADV_FREE pages will be kept
until reclaiming most of the times.

Clean page cache still have valid contents, while clean MADV_FREE pages
has no valid contents.  So penalty of discarding the clean page cache is
reading from disk, while the penalty of discarding clean MADV_FREE pages
is just page allocation and zeroing.

I understand that MADV_FREE is another kind of cache and has its value.
But in the original implementation, during migration, we have already
freed the original "cache", then reallocate the cache elsewhere and
copy.  This appears more like all pages are populated in mmap() always.
I know there's value to populate all pages in mmap(), but does that need
to be done always by default?
