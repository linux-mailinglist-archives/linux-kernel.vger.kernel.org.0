This is true, I did not really like that either, but was one of the things
I came up.
I already have some ideas how to avoid checking the page, I will work on it.

IMHO, having vmemmap pages in ZONE_MOVABLE do not matter that match.
They are not counted as managed_pages, and they are not show-stopper for
moving all the other data around (migrate), they are just skipped.
Conceptually, they are not pages we can deal with.

I thought they should lay wherever the range lays.
Having said that, I do not oppose to place them in ZONE_NORMAL, as they might
fit there better under the theory that ZONE_NORMAL have memory that might not be
movable/migratable.

As for initializing them in add_memory(), we cannot do that.
First problem is that we first need sparse_mem_map_populate to create
the mapping, and to take the pages from our altmap.

Then, we can access and initialize those pages.
So we cannot do that in add_memory() because that happens before.

And I really think that it fits much better in __add_pages than in add_memory.

Given said that, I would appreciate some comments in patches#3 and patches#4,
specially patch#4.
So I would like to collect some feedback in those before sending a new version.

Thanks David
