So I guess without changing the dts, option (a) doesn't really work.

I don't have time but option (c) was already discussed and there are
patches from Nicolas on the list:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20190820145821.27214-5-nsaenzjulienne@suse.de/

The above series was checking whether the platform is RPi4 and limiting
the ZONE_DMA size to 1GB (otherwise 4GB with ZONE_DMA32 empty). We ended
up with a static 1GB for ZONE_DMA but we missed the fact that it may
break existing platforms.

So I don't think it would be too hard to revive the above series (most
of it was already merged).
