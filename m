That should be another approach, but it might be a bit more complicated 
than just appending ":u"/":k" modifiers to the event name string.

Yes agree.

If this new semantics can be accepted, I'd like to add perf record 
supporting as well. :)

Another difficulty for the new semantics is we need to create user and 
kernel stat type in runtime_stat rblist (see patch "perf stat: Support 
topdown with --all-kernel/--all-user"). That has to bring extra complexity.
