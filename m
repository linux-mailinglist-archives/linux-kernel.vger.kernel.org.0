What is "ECDSA signature generation"?  Is it a crypto thing?  If so, why
not use the crypto api?  If not, what exactly is it?

Pointers to that patchset?  Why was it not accepted?

Why does this matter?

How big are messages and signatures?  Why does this have to be a sysfs
api?

Why not use the crypto api, and if that doesn't work, why not just a
char device to read/write?

Poke the maintainer again :)
