Any comment from the RCU camp on this?
Maybe just adding the missing RCU annotation for the list annotation is
enough (like if lock X or Y is held then everything fine). !RT gets this
implicit via preempt_disable(). I'm just worried if someone expects
this kind of behaviour.
If I remember correctly, Scott added rcu_read_lock() recently to
local_bh_disable() because RCU-torture expected it.
