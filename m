Just FYI, 0day clang builds are live now. I have not seen anything from
KVM yet but I do not know how many configurations are being tested and
such:

Indeed; our CI for clang builds is all done with the master versions of
clang available from apt.llvm.org so we can catch issues as soon as
possible and having -Werror would mean a potentially benign issue (like
one we are currently dealing with where clang's -Wvoid-pointer-to-int-cast
warns when casting to an enum where gcc does not:
https://reviews.llvm.org/D72231#1878528) would cause our CI to go
instantly red across the board and not catch other issues.

I would say a CONFIG_CC_WERROR or something of that nature would not
necessarily be a bad thing since we could just disable it for our CI (or
have it be default disabled) but I think if someone cares about -Werror,
they should just use the KCFLAGS trick at the point, since I would think
that would be easier than maintaining a separate config option.

FWIW, our clang powerpc builds were broken for 4 months because of
arch/powerpc using -Werror:

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/625

We have infrastructure in place to carry out of tree patches if
absolutely necessary, which we had to use for a while:

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/continuous-integration/commit/4d1b3c74bcb3ed0090073c9d9e6ae303425d4adc
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/continuous-integration/commit/0c3885049e2a6e28c72be13f5b05fb25ff79904b
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/continuous-integration/commit/533fcec33fdb8526333a6fd91d24534eeb96bed5

Even now, there is a warning in the RDMA subsystem that points to a very
clear bug that has still not been merged into your tree:

https://git.kernel.org/rdma/rdma/c/4ca501d6aaf21de31541deac35128bbea8427aa6

I am not blaming anyone for that, I get that every maintainer has their
own test suite and pull request schedule but I believe that it shows
the general apathy towards warning fixes from maintainers (at least,
from the perspective of someone who sends a large amount of warning
fixes). I would argue this should change before -Werror could even
begin to be considered as a default option.

Cheers,
Nathan
