For future reference, if you have someone's tag in your commit message
it's nice to CC them on the email.

In my previous reply [1], I asked about these flags and if it was
intentional that they were different from sdm845.  I did see a private
response, but no public one.  In the future note that it's good to
reply publicly so everyone understands what happened.  In this case, I
was told "the GDSC's on 845 and SC7180 are different and hence the
change in flags is expected".  That answers my question and thus I'm
fine with my tag being here.  It also looks like you took my other
review feedback on v1, which is nice.
