But the connection can be restarted by switching the backend to the
init state again.

That's a fine goal, but not switching to closed state in
xenbus_dev_remove seems wrong, as you have actually left the frontend
without a matching backend and with the state not set to closed.

Ie: that would be fine if you explicitly state this is some kind of
internal blkback reload, but not for the general case where blkback
has been unbound. I think we need someway to difference a blkback
reload vs a unbound.

Thanks, Roger.
