I see the benefit of reporting the physical layout and packaging 
information to user-space for tracking reasons, but from software 
perspective this doesn't matter, and the resource partitioning should be 
described elsewhere (NUMA nodes being the go to example).

Seems my hypothetical case is already in the works :(

Fair enough, it's a little late now to un-expose this info to userspace 
so we should at least present it correctly. My worry was this getting 
out of hand with layering, for instance what happens when we need to add 
die nodes in-between cluster and socket?
