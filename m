Joe is saying that he made some suggestions, which Shuah commented on,
but has no intention of posting a formal patch.  The end result of
that discussion is to define pr_fmt once in integrity/integrity.h and
remove any duplication in the integrity/ files.

I'd appreciate your including that change in this patch set, and if
needed a similar one in ima/ima.h.

thanks,

Mimi
