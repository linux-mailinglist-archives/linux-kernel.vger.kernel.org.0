There is a number of disputable statements here.

Out of the fairly large zoo of arm64 systems I have access to, 75% of
them are based on GICv2, so they are still the overwhelming majority.
Yes, they all run KVM (otherwise I would ignore them).

Furthermore, I would expect that "powerful servers" are perfectly
capable to execute a couple of branches without breaking a sweat.

Finally, you don't provide any number supporting that:

- GICv3 systems see a performance improvement across the large variety
  of CPU implementations
- GICv2 systems don't see a performance regression

Once you provide such numbers, I'll reevaluate my position. Until
then, I'm not considering this kind of change.

Thanks,

	M.
