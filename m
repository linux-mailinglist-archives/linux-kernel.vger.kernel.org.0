With idle=poll the delays seem to be minimal.

Is there any way to limit the C state entered by mwait?
Or to try the check that monitor/mwait is being triggered properly.
Is there a clfulsh() in the writing side?
If not, might one help??

I see almost repeatable delays eg for 6 processes being scheduled (more or less in sequence).
10us waking cpu 2.
60us waking cpu 1.
40us waking cpu 0 and 40us waking cpu3.
20us waking cpu 2.
20us waking cpu 0.
None of the processes runs for anything like the delays.
The whole thing repeats every 10ms.
Note that the first process is actually signalling a CV that 4 of the other 5
are waiting on.
So there are cumulative delays of around 140us before the 4th is woken.
