As I mentioned elsewhere, the recent dma-direct rework means that 
dma_dummy_ops are now only explicitly installed for the ACPI error case, 
so - much as I may dislike it - you should get regular (direct/SWIOTLB) 
ops by default again.

Coherency is trickier - if the guest is allocating buffers for the PV 
device, which may be shared directly with hardware by the host driver, 
then the coherency of the PV device should really reflect that of the 
underlying hardware to avoid potential problems. There are some cases 
where the stage 2 attributes alone wouldn't be enough to correct a mismatch.

Robin.
