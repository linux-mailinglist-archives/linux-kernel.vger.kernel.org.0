In the case of slub memory allocator, it is not just unused space within
a slab. It is also the use of per-cpu slabs that can hold up a lot of
memory, especially if the tasks jump around to different cpus. The
problem is compounded if a lot of memcgs are being used. Memory
utilization can improve quite significantly if per-cpu slabs are
disabled. Of course, it comes with a performance cost.
