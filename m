Maybe it would be just a theoretical scenario, but I'm not seeing any 
reason why this cannot happen in pblk implementation:
Let assume that user line X+1 is opened when GC line X is already open 
and the user line is closed when GC line X is still in use. Then GC 
quickly choose user line X+1 as a GC victim and we are hitting 2nd case.

Your solution sounds right, but I would extend this based on my previous 
comment to 2nd case by sth like: during opening new user data also add 
this line ID to this "blacklist" for the GC selection.
