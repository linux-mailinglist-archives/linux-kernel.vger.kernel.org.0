Not unspecified. It is specified as "Reserved", for which the behaviour
is perfectly defined. Does it also mean that other register in the
GICD space will suffer from the same problem? How about the 
redistributors,
the ITS?

I don't follow. My copy of IHI0096C shows:

- GICD_IIDR: Offset 8
- Reserved: Offset  0xc
- GICD_STATUSR: Offset 0x10

I can't see how you'd squeeze a 64bit register between IIDR and STATUSR.

It's not an ITS register. This is a distributor register, and these are
always 32bit. Even the 64bit registers must support 32bit accesses
because of AArch32 (such as GICD_IROUTERn).

No, the spec has always been pretty precise. It says [IHI0069A, 8.8]:

"Unless otherwise stated in the register description, all GIC registers
are 32-bits wide."

And the reason for that is that it has to work with 32bit CPUs. So as 
far
as I can see, TX1 is violating the letter of the architecture. As for 
checking
ArchRev, that's a firm No. All registers exist on all revision of the
architecture, which is why there's a unified GICv3/v4 architecture 
document.

Even XGene-1 was available before TX1, and wasn't so grossly buggy.
And even then. Having a buggy CPU is not the end of the world if
the SV works with us. Over the past 5 years, we have had to work
*despite* Cavium. Yes, I'm a bit bitter about it.

How about getting Marvell to actually work with upstream? Over 5 months
between a bug being reported and the first acknowledgement that "yes,
we may have a problem here" is not exactly something that fills me
with the utmost confidence.
