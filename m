I guess with different filename there is no need to compare dso_id.
But for same filename, adding dso_id cmp will separate out the
samples:

Ex, Without dso_id compare:

   $ ./perf report -s dso,dso_size -v
     66.63%  /home/ravi/a.out                                  4096
     33.36%  /home/ravi/Workspace/linux/tools/perf/a.out       4096

   $ ./perf report -s dso,dso_size
     99.99%  a.out                 4096


With below diff:

   -       return strcmp(dso_name_l, dso_name_r);
   +       ret = strcmp(dso_name_l, dso_name_r);
   +       if (ret)
   +               return ret;
   +       else
   +               return dso__cmp_id(dso_l, dso_r);


   $ ./perf report -s dso,dso_size
     99.99%  a.out                 4096
     33.36%  a.out                 4096

though, the o/p also depends which other sort keys are used along
with dso key. Do you think this change makes sense?
