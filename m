To make everyone not miss a bit - I believe we had 2 issues here, even 
though that one may seem harmless from user perspective:

 From IPC logs indeed it looks like a redundant (additional) stream 
initialization has occurred - said redundant stream is destroyed right 
after it has been created, and only to be recreated yet again.. Can 
share the logs if required.

While hw_params() handled doubled init nicely, _reset and _free
did not (during on pcm_close()) -> secondary invokes attempted to RESET
and FREE stream despite it being destroyed long ago. With revert of
patch I had mentioned, no lines:

!!!	haswell-pcm-audio haswell-pcm-audio: warning: stream is NULL, no
stream to reset, ignore it.
!!!	haswell-pcm-audio haswell-pcm-audio: warning: stream is NULL, no
stream to free, ignore it.

should appear.

I'll focus now on the commits you found offending during your bisect. 
Thank you Dominik!
