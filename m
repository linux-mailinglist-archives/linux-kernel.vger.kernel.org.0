No, we do not need this entry at all. This is an artifact left from
testing which I'll remove. The ID register is already modified to hide
the presence of AMU for both 32bit and 64bit guests (patch 3/6), and
this was supposed to be here just to validate that the capping of this
field for the guest does its job.

Thanks, that's fine.

To be honest, I would like not to have to use information about AMU
version for future support, but yes, it would be good to have the
possibility, just in case.

Thank you very much for the review,
