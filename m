Let me clear my thoughts. If I read correctly, the struct pages for sections
(including partially present sections) on ZONE_DEVICE are allocated by
vmemmap_populate(). And all the struct pages except (altmap->base_pfn) to
(altmap->base_pfn + altmap->reserve) are initialized by memmap_init_zone()
and memmap_init_zone_device().

Do struct pages for partially present sections go through a different process?

Thanks,
