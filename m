Subject: [PATCH 2/3] mm, page_alloc: more extensive free page checking with debug_pagealloc

The page allocator checks struct pages for expected state (mapcount, flags etc)
as pages are being allocated (check_new_page()) and freed (free_pages_check())
to provide some defense against errors in page allocator users. Prior commits
479f854a207c ("mm, page_alloc: defer debugging checks of pages allocated from
the PCP") and 4db7548ccbd9 ("mm, page_alloc: defer debugging checks of freed
pages until a PCP drain") this has happened for order-0 pages as they were
allocated from or freed to the per-cpu caches (pcplists). Since those are fast
paths, the checks are now performed only when pages are moved between pcplists
and global free lists. This however lowers the chances of catching errors soon
enough.

In order to increase the chances of the checks to catch errors, the kernel has
to be rebuilt with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM, which also enables multiple other internal
debug checks (VM_BUG_ON() etc), which is suboptimal when the goal is to catch
errors in mm users, not in mm code itself.

To catch some wrong users of page allocator, we have CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC,
which is designed to have virtually no overhead unless enabled at boot time.
Memory corruptions when writing to freed pages have often the same underlying
errors (use-after-free, double free) as corrupting the corresponding struct
pages, so this existing debugging functionality is a good fit to extend by
also perform struct page checks at least as often as if CONFIG_DEBUG_VM was
enabled.

Specifically, after this patch, when debug_pagealloc is enabled on boot, and
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM disabled, pages are checked when allocated from or freed to the
pcplists *in addition* to being moved between pcplists and free lists. When
both debug_pagealloc and CONFIG_DEBUG_VM are enabled, pages are checked when
being moved between pcplists and free lists *in addition* to when allocated
from or freed to the pcplists.

When debug_pagealloc is not enabled on boot, the overhead in fast paths should
be virtually none thanks to the use of static key.
