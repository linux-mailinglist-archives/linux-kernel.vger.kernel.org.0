On the SoC, total 4 combophy (0,1,2 and 3) instances are present -> 
'cell-index'
2 instances (0,1) are present on the HSIOL NoC
Other 2 instances (2,3) are present on the HSIOR NoC
On the both HSIO NoCs, combophy instances are referred as 0 and 1 -> 'bid'

'bid' is required while accessing the registers in hsio block, to 
configure the COMBOPHY mode and clock
'cell-index' is required while accessing sysconfig registers to enable 
the pcie phy pad ref clock.

<&hsio 1>
'bid' is specific to the combophy, not all the DT nodes using &hsio has 
a need.
I think it is better to pass the bid value as a entry of combophy DT node.

I will add dt entry something like 'hw-instance-id' instead of 
cell-index or aliases.

Dilip
