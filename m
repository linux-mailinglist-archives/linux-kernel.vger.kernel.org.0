THe load balancer takes either idle CPUs or running tasks into account
depending on SD flags. Unless this check is removed, the CPU usage
across nodes becomes imbalanced, the load balancer takes action and
testing indicates that performance degrades severely. The impact is
illustrated in the leader of the patch series as well as the effect of
this patch in isolation.

Performance suffers on numerous workloads that way.

Again, it hits corner cases. While there is scope for allowing some
degree of imbalance, it needs to be a separate patch on top of this.
It's something I intend to examine but only once this series is out of
the way because the NUMA and load balancer do need to be using similar
logic first or it gets a bit fragile.

With this patch, and the series in general, it does mean that some tasks
fail to migrate to a CPU local to the memory being accessed even though
there are CPUs available but having the NUMA balancer and load balancer
override each other is not free either.

Thanks.
