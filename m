Thanks for clarifying.

Suppose two different non-root users create keyring with the same name 
"foo" and, say, both are measured, how would we know which keyring 
measurement belongs to which user?

Wouldn't it be sufficient to include only keyrings created by "root" 
(UID value 0) in the key measurement? This will include all the builtin 
trusted keyrings (such as .builtin_trusted_keys, 
.secondary_trusted_keys, .ima, .evm, etc.).

What would be the use case for including keyrings created by non-root 
users in key measurement?

Also, since the UID for non-root users can be any integer value (greater 
than 0), can an an administrator craft a generic IMA policy that would 
be applicable to all clients in an enterprise?

thanks,
