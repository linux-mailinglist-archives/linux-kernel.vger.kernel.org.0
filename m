I thought it was a good habit to keep the facts of issues.  Backtrace
is one of them so I kept them.  It could, for example, help people who
spot the same issue in an old/downstream kernel so when they google or
grepping git-log they know the exact issue has been solved by some
commit, even without much knowledge on the internals (because they can
exactly compare the whole dmesg error).

Thanks for your suggestions on not using subjective words and so on.
I'll remember these.

However I think I still miss one thing in the puzzle (although it
turns out that we've agreed on removing the warning already, but just
in case I missed something important) - do you mean that offlining all
the non-isolated CPUs in the mask won't trigger this already?  Because
I also saw some similar comment somewhere else...

Here's my understanding - when offlining, we'll disable the CPU and
reach:

  - irq_migrate_all_off_this_cpu
    - migrate_one_irq
      - irq_do_set_affinity
        - calculate HK_FLAG_MANAGED_IRQ and so on...

Then we can still trigger this irq move event even before we bring
another housekeeping cpu online, right?  Or could you guide me on what
I have missed?

Thanks,
