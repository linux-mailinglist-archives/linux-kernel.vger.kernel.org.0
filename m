Well, a PPI might be possible to use, although it's somewhat dodgy to hijack the GIC's (re-)distributor from EL3 to write to GICD_ISPENDR<n>. Need to ask Marc about his feelings towards this. But it's definitely possible from a hypervisor to inject arbitrary interrupts into a guest.

But more importantly: is there any actual reason this needs to be a GIC interrupt? If I understand the code correctly, this could just be any interrupt, including one of an interrupt combiner or a GPIO chip. So why not just use the standard wording of: "exactly one interrupt specifier for each channel"?

By the way: Shouldn't new bindings use the YAML format instead?

Cheers,
Andre.
