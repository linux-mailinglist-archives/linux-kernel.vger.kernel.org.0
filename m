Thanks for the explanation and the reference. The idle-state.yaml has a nice
diagram. I won't insist, but I think including the definition of break even
will help a lot to make the patch more understandable.

I see it now. If denote the condition as B. If it was false then the OR will
reduce to !idle. But if it was True, then which path you take will depend only
on state of idle too, which you check in both paths.
