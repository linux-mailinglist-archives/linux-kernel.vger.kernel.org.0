And they come from 71 different files (list enclosed). I didn't look on them,
and I'll stop handling here for now, as I need to handle some other stuff.

Yet, manually fixing those 71 ABI files doesn't sound a too hard work. It
can probably be done on a single day.

So, I suspect we could enable :rst: and manually fix those.
