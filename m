OK, this is truly extreme case, thanks for sharing.

Then I have several questions about it:

1) Can we use crashkernel=high, crashkernel=low, to fix this issue?
I believe in this system you told, it must be a high-end server, should
have hardware iommu depolyed. It doesn't need 256M low memory actually,
maybe 128M, even 64M is enough?

Asking this is because the 256M is default setting, default value only
covers general cases.

2) What if the system becomes more extreme, like the largest contiguous
free physical pages is less than 256M, even less than 128M?

Even though kernel image is limited to above 4G, whose fault is it? and
how can we fix it in this case?

3) If we really add limitation, maybe add kaslr_high to limit KASLR to
only put kernel image above 4G?

I think they meant almost no low memory, and it's a prototype machine to
experiment. Can't remember the detail.
