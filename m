Hmm, will clean up.

Thanks, will do.

Yeah it has dependency on the hot-remove series. The only outstanding issue
there being whether to call free_empty_tables() in vmemmap tear down path
or not. Mark had asked for more details regarding the implications in cases
where free_empty_tables() is called or is not called. I did evaluate those
details recently and we should be able to take a decision sooner.
