I really do not see why. It seems a pretty consistent behavior to me.
Because it essentially cut any memory above the given size. If a new
hotplugable memory fits into that cap then it just shows up. Quite
contrary I would consider it unexpected that a memory higher than the
given mem=XYZ is really there. But I do recognize a real usecase
mentioned elsewhere which beats the consistency argument here because
all setups where such a restriction would be really important are
debugging/workaround AFAICS.
