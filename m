Question to make sure we are talking about the same thing: multi-link 
bank switching is a capability beyond the scope of the SoundWire spec 
which requires hardware support to synchronize links and as Sanyog 
hinted at in a previous email follow a different flow for bank switches.

You would not use the multi-link mode if you have different links that 
can operate independently and have no synchronization requirement. You 
would conversely use the multi-link mode if you have two devices on the 
same type on different links and want audio to be rendered at the same time.

Can you clarify if indeed you were using the full-blown multi-link mode 
with hardware synchronization or a regular single-link operation? I am 
not asking for details of your test hardware, just trying to reconstruct 
the program flow leading to this problem.

It could also be that your commit message was meant to say:
"the msg lock is taken for multi-link cases only but released 
unconditionally, leading to an unlock balance warning for single-link 
usages"?

Thanks!
