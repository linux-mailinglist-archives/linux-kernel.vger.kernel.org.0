Sure - I am fine with truncating the 2/2 patch description. Thanks for 
doing that.

Regarding "Freeing the queued keys if custom policy is not loaded":

Shall I create a new patch set to address that and have that be reviewed 
independent of this patch set?

Like you'd suggested earlier, we can wait for a certain time, after IMA 
is initialized, and free the queue if a custom policy was not loaded.

Please let me know.
