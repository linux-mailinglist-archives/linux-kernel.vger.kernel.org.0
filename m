True, albeit this doesn't cover INTX_DISABLE.

True again, but any bug here (as in: too wide exposure) is a qemu
bug (possibly security issue). The statement also isn't really
correct for de-privileged qemu, I think (but I also think PCI
pass-through doesn't work in that mode at all yet).

On the whole this looks to be an acceptable approach to me. But
I'm not the maintainer, so my opinion may not count much. Some
issues with the implementation itself were already pointed out.
