+ * DOC: dataring overview
+ *
+ * A dataring is a lockless ringbuffer consisting of variable length data
+ * blocks, each of which are assigned an ID. The IDs map to descriptors, which
+ * contain metadata about the data block. The lookup function mapping IDs to
+ * descriptors is implemented by the user.
+ *
+ * Data Blocks
+ * -----------
+ * All ringbuffer data is stored within a single static byte array. This is
+ * to ensure that any pointers to the data (past and present) will always
+ * point to valid memory. This is important because the lockless readers
+ * and writers may preempt for long periods of time and when they resume may
+ * be working with expired pointers.
+ *
+ * Data blocks are specified by begin and end logical positions (lpos) that
+ * map directly to byte array offsets. Using logical positions indirectly
+ * provides tagged state references for the data blocks to avoid ABA issues
+ * when the ringbuffer wraps. The number of tagged states per index is::
+ *
+ *	sizeof(long) / size of byte array
+ *
+ * If a data block starts near the end of the byte array but would extend
+ * beyond it, that data block is handled differently: a special "wrapping data
+ * block" is inserted in the space available at the end of the byte array and
+ * a "content data block" is placed at the beginning of the byte array. This
+ * can waste space at the end of the byte array, but simplifies the
+ * implementation by allowing writers to always work with contiguous buffers.
+ * For example, for a 1000 byte array, a descriptor may show a start lpos of
+ * 1950 and an end lpos of 2100. The data block associated with this
+ * descriptor is 100 bytes in size. Its ID is located in the "wrapping" data
+ * block (located at offset 950 of the byte array) and its data is found in
+ * the "content" data block (located at offset 0 of the byte array).
+ *
+ * Descriptors
+ * -----------
+ * A descriptor is a handle to a data block. How descriptors are structured
+ * and mapped to IDs is implemented by the user.
+ *
+ * Descriptors contain the begin (begin_lpos) and end (next_lpos) logical
+ * positions of the data block they represent. The end logical position
+ * matches the begin logical position of the adjacent data block.
+ *
+ * Why Descriptors?
+ * ----------------
+ * The data ringbuffer supports variable length entities, which means that
+ * data blocks will not always begin at a predictable offset of the byte
+ * array. This is a major problem for lockless writers that, for example, will
+ * compete to expire and reuse old data blocks when the ringbuffer is full.
+ * Without a predictable begin for the data blocks, a writer has no reliable
+ * information about the status of the "free" area. Are any flags or state
+ * variables already set or is it just garbage left over from previous usage?
+ *
+ * Descriptors allow safe and controlled access to data block metadata by
+ * providing predictable offsets for such metadata. This is key to supporting
+ * multiple concurrent lockless writers.
+ *
+ * Behavior
+ * --------
+ * The data ringbuffer allows writers to commit data without regard for
+ * readers. Readers must pre- and post-validate the data blocks they are
+ * processing to be sure the processed data is consistent. A function
+ * dataring_datablock_isvalid() is available for that. Readers can only
+ * iterate data blocks by utilizing an external implementation using
+ * descriptor lookups based on IDs.
+ *
+ * Writers commit data in two steps:
+ *
+ * (1) Reserve a new data block (dataring_push()).
+ * (2) Commit the data block (dataring_datablock_setid()).
+ *
+ * Once a data block is committed, it is available for recycling by another
+ * writer. Therefore, once committed, a writer must no longer access the data
+ * block.
+ *
+ * If data block reservation fails, it means the oldest reserved data block
+ * has not yet been committed by its writer. This acts as a blocker for any
+ * future data block reservation.

+/**
+ * DOC: numlist overview
+ *
+ * A numlist is a lockless FIFO queue list, where the nodes of the list are
+ * sequentially numbered. A numlist can be iterated over by non-consuming
+ * readers. The purpose of the sequence numbers is so that a non-consuming
+ * reader can identify if it has missed nodes (for example, if they were
+ * popped off the list before the non-consuming reader could finish reading
+ * them).
+ *
+ * IDs vs. Pointers
+ * ----------------
+ * Rather than nodes being linked by pointers, each node is given an ID and
+ * has the ID of the next node in the list. IDs are used in order to avoid an
+ * ABA problem between writers when assigning sequence numbers.
+ *
+ * The ABA problem using pointers can be seen if the list has one node and
+ * while CPU0 is adding a second node another CPU adds and removes nodes
+ * (recycling the node that CPU0 saw as the head)::
+ *
+ *	CPU0                          CPU1
+ *	----                          ----
+ *	(enter numlist_push())
+ *	head = READ_ONCE(h->head);
+ *	seq = READ_ONCE(head->seq);
+ *	WRITE_ONCE(n->seq, seq + 1);
+ *	WRITE_ONCE(n->next, NULL);
+ *	                              numlist_push(); // add some node
+ *	                              numlist_pop();  // remove "head"
+ *	                              numlist_push(); // re-add "head"
+ *	cmpxchg(&h->head, head, n);
+ *	WRITE_ONCE(head->next, n);
+ *	(exit numlist_push())
+ *
+ * Let the original head have a sequence number of 1. Then after the above
+ * scenario the list nodes could have the following sequence numbers::
+ *
+ *	1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2
+ *
+ * The problem is that the cmpxchg() is succeeding even though the head that
+ * CPU0 wants to replace is not the head it expects. This problem is avoided
+ * by using IDs, which indirectly provide tagged state references for the
+ * nodes. The number of tagged states per node is::
+ *
+ *	sizeof(long) / max number of nodes in the list
+ *
+ * Using IDs instead of pointers, the cmpxchg() will fail as it should.
+ *
+ * Numlist users are required to implement a function to map ID values to
+ * numlist nodes and are responsible for issuing IDs to numlist nodes.
+ *
+ * Behavior
+ * --------
+ * A numbered list has two conditions in order to pop the tail node from the
+ * list:
+ *
+ * * The tail node is not the only node on the list.
+ * * The tail node is not busy.
+ *
+ * The first condition is necessary to support writers adding new nodes to the
+ * list. Such writers must modify the "next pointer" of the previous head,
+ * which becomes complex/racey if that previous head could be removed from the
+ * list and recycled during the update. One consequence of this condition is
+ * that numbered lists must be initialized such that the tail and head are
+ * already pointing to a node.
+ *
+ * For the second condition, the term "busy" is defined by the user, who must
+ * implement a function to report if a node is busy. This gives the user
+ * control to decide if a node can be removed from the list.
+ *
+ * For non-consuming readers, the function numlist_read() needs to be called a
+ * second time after reading node data to ensure the node is still valid.
+ * Nodes can become invalid while being read by non-consuming readers.

+/**
+ * DOC: prb overview
+ *
+ * As the name suggests, this ringbuffer was implemented specifically to
+ * serve the needs of the printk() infrastructure. The ringbuffer itself is
+ * not specific to printk and could be used for other purposes. However, the
+ * requirements and semantics of printk are rather unique. If you intend to
+ * use this ringbuffer for anything other than printk, you need to be very
+ * clear on its features, behavior, and limitations.
+ *
+ * Features
+ * --------
+ * * single global buffer
+ * * resides in initialized data section (available at early boot)
+ * * supports multiple concurrent lockless readers and writers
+ * * safe from any context (including NMI)
+ * * groups bytes into variable length data blocks (referenced by entries)
+ * * entries tagged with sequence numbers
+ *
+ * Terminology
+ * -----------
+ * * data block: A contiguous block of data containing an ID of an associated
+ *               descriptor and the raw data from the writer.
+ *
+ * * descriptor: Meta data for a data block containing an ID, the logical
+ *               positions of the associated data block, a unique sequence
+ *               number, and a pointer to the next (newer) descriptor.
+ *
+ * * entry:      A high level object used by the readers/writers that contains
+ *               a descriptor as well as state information during the
+ *               reserve/commit window.
+ *
+ * Data Structure
+ * --------------
+ * The ringbuffer implementation makes use of two internal data structures:
+ *
+ * * a data ringbuffer (dataring) to manage the raw data storage of entries
+ *
+ * * a numbered list (numlist) to sort and sequentially label committed
+ *   entries
+ *
+ * Both dataring and numlist implementations make use of ID numbers to
+ * identify their entities. The ringbuffer implementation creates and manages
+ * those IDs using the same value for all data structures (i.e. ID=22 for a
+ * dataring data block and descriptor corresponds to ID=22 for the numlist
+ * node.)
+ *
+ * The ringbuffer implementation provides a high-level descriptor (prb_desc).
+ * This descriptor contains the ID, a dataring descriptor, and a numlist node,
+ * thus acting as the unifying entity for the various data structures.
+ *
+ * The descriptors are stored within a static array and IDs map directly to
+ * array offsets. The full range of IDs (unsigned long) is used in order to
+ * provide tagged state references for the descriptors to avoid ABA issues
+ * when the descriptors are recycled. The number of tagged states per
+ * descriptor is::
+ *
+ *	sizeof(long) / number of descriptors in the array
+ *
+ * Behavior
+ * --------
+ * Since the printk ringbuffer is lockless, there exists no synchronization
+ * between readers and writers. Basically writers are the tasks in control and
+ * may overwrite any and all committed data at any time and from any context.
+ * For this reason readers can miss entries if they are overwritten before the
+ * reader was able to access the data. The reader API implementation is such
+ * that reader access to data is atomic, so there is no risk of readers having
+ * to deal with partial or corrupt data blocks. Also, entries include the
+ * sequence number of the associated descriptor so that readers can recognize
+ * if entries were missed.
+ *
+ * Writing to the ringbuffer consists of two steps:
+ *
+ * (1) Reserve data (prb_reserve()).
+ * (2) Commit the reserved data (prb_commit()).
+ *
+ * The sequence number is assigned on commit.
+ *
+ * Once committed, a writer must no longer access the data directly. This is
+ * because the data may have been overwritten and no longer exists. If a
+ * writer must access the data, it should either keep a private copy before
+ * committing or use the reader API to gain access to the data.
+ *
+ * Because of how the data backend (dataring) is implemented, data blocks that
+ * have been reserved but not yet committed act as blockers, preventing future
+ * writers from filling the ringbuffer beyond the location of the reserved but
+ * not yet committed data block region. For this reason it is important that
+ * writers perform both reserve and commit as quickly as possible. To assist
+ * with this, local interrupts are disabled during the reserve/commit window.
+ * Writers in NMI contexts can still preempt any other writers, but as long
+ * as these writers do not write a large amount of data with respect to the
+ * ringbuffer size, this should not become an issue.
+ *
+ * The reader API provides an iterator to traverse the list of committed
+ * entries. The iterator utilizes a user-provided entry buffer to copy into
+ * and validate the entry data upon traversal.
+ *
+ * Entry Lifecycle
+ * ---------------
+ * This is an overview of the lifecycle for an entry. It is meant to assist in
+ * understanding how the various data structures and their procedures are
+ * coordinated. Following is what happens within the reserve/commit window of
+ * a writer:
+ *
+ * (1) Reserve a descriptor (part 1 of 3): Invalidate the oldest data block by
+ *     moving the dataring tail forward. (See the next step for why this was
+ *     necessary.)
+ *
+ * (2) Reserve a descriptor (part 2 of 3): Remove the oldest descriptor from
+ *     the committed list by removing the numlist tail. (Note that
+ *     descriptors can only be removed if their associated data block is
+ *     invalid. That invalidation was performed in the previous step.)
+ *
+ * (3) Reserve a descriptor (part 3 of 3): Invalidate the removed descriptor
+ *     by modifying its ID.
+ *
+ * (4) Reserve data: Reserve a new data block by moving the dataring head
+ *     forward.
+ *
+ * (5) Write data: Write the user data into the reserved data block.
+ *
+ * (6) Commit the data: Set the descriptor ID in the reserved data block.
+ *
+ * (7) Commit the descriptor (part 1 of 2): Add the descriptor to the
+ *     committed list by setting it as the numlist head.
+ *
+ * (8) Commit the descriptor (part 2 of 2): Link the descriptor to the older
+ *     committed entries by setting it as the "next pointer" of the former
+ *     numlist head.
+ *
+ * Usage
+ * -----
+ * Here are some simple examples demonstrating writers and readers. For the
+ * examples it is assumed that a global ringbuffer is available::
+ *
+ *	DECLARE_PRINTKRB(rb, 5, 7);
+ *
+ * This ringbuffer has a size of 4096 bytes, expects an average data size of
+ * 32 bytes, and allows up to 128 descriptors.
+ *
+ * Sample writer code::
+ *
+ *	struct prb_reserved_entry e;
+ *	char *s;
+ *
+ *	s = prb_reserve(&e, &rb, 16);
+ *	if (s) {
+ *		snprintf(s, 16, "Hello, world!");
+ *		prb_commit(&e);
+ *	}
+ *
+ * Sample reader code::
+ *
+ *	DECLARE_PRINTKRB_ENTRY(e, 64);
+ *	struct prb_iterator iter;
+ *	u64 last_seq = 0;
+ *	int len;
+ *	char *s;
+ *
+ *	prb_for_each_entry(&iter, &rb, &e, len) {
+ *		if (e.seq - last_seq != 1) {
+ *			pr_warn("LOST %llu ENTRIES\n",
+ *				e.seq - (last_seq + 1));
+ *		}
+ *		last_seq = e.seq;
+ *
+ *		s = (char *)&e.buffer[0];
+ *		if (len >= 64) {
+ *			pr_warn("ENTRY %llu TRUNCATED\n", e.seq);
+ *			s[64 - 1] = 0;
+ *		}
+ *		pr_info("%llu: %s\n", e.seq, s);
+ *	}
