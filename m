Ah I haven't thought about the "theoretical hole" and that far...  I
think I was only focusing on whether set_affinity() would happen, but
I ignored the fact that x86 __send_cleanup_vector() treated offlining
CPU in the special way to avoid sending IRQ_MOVE_CLEANUP_VECTOR at
all.  And that part makes perfect sense since we can't do much with an
offlined core.

Definitely.

Thanks for writting this up, Thomas!
