I have some doubts. With reinit_cache_random_seq() for SLUB, s->random_seq will
in turn:
cache_random_seq_destroy()
- point to an object that's been kfree'd
- point to NULL
init_cache_random_seq()
  cache_random_seq_create()
  - point to freshly allocated zeroed out object
    freelist_randomize()
    - the object is gradually initialized
- the indices are gradually transformed to page offsets

At any point of this, new slab can be allocated in parallel and observe
s->random_seq in shuffle_freelist(), and it's only ok if it's currently NULL.

Could it be fixed? In the reinit part you would need to
- atomically update a valid s->random_seq to another valid s->random_seq
(perhaps with NULL in between which means some freelist won't be perhaps randomized)
- write barrier
- call calculate_sizes() with updated flags / new order, make sure all the
fields of s-> are updated in a safe order and with write barries (i.e. update
s->oo and s->flags would be probably last, but maybe that's not all) so that
anyone allocating a new slab will always get something valid (maybe that path
would need also new read barriers?)

No, I don't think it's worth the trouble?
