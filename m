It seems hardware supports HS400 only at the expected 200MHz frequency.
The assumption then is that the command will be seen by the card but the
response may have a CRC error.  So we would need to ignore CRC errors, but
it would also be worth waiting the timeout if the card is still busy whether
or not there is an error.

The only way to mitigate errors then is to increase the number of retries.
