Oh sorry I missed that.

I guess the binding he refers to is max-memory-bandwidth, which is used
in multiple driver already. It makes sense to reuse this property
instead of inventing a new set of property which is also not taking bpp
into account...

The pl111 driver implements this property, it should be fairly easy to
adopt that code.
