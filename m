	First of all, nothing in that line can possibly *cause*
copyout() to do anything - it's after the calls of step.  What's
more, this changes behaviour only when wanted would've been equal to
n, doesn't it?  Which translates into "no decrements of n have
happened at all", i.e. "nothing has been copied".  IOW, it's
a consequence of no copyout, not the cause of such.  You can
make copy_to_iter() lie and pretend if has copied everything
when it has copied nothing, but that won't change the underlying
bug.

	So I'm afraid your debugging is not finished - you
still need to find out what causes the copyout failures and/or
BS iov_iter padded by caller.
