OK, thanks for checking. So when Linux is in complete control both DP
tunnels get created properly. I suspect there is something different
what the firmware does compared to other Macs I've been using and that
causes the driver to fail to discover all the paths. I will take a look
at this but I'm away tomorrow and friday so it goes to next week.

BTW, have you tried to chain the two monitors?
