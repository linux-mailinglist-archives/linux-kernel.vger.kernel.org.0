I agree a more generic way of controlling it would be good.

Thanks you, just so that you know, the latest patchset is at:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/12/20/794

It would be great to get some additional testing if possible. I can
send a sample ACPI (for our platform) in case it helps.

 drm spec; we need to confirm that). We also have the ACPI events that noti=

t should be done in thinkpad_acpi.c and not the drm code.

Not sure if the two need to be connected somehow (or if handling the
event is actually not important and polling is acceptable)?

So there was some brief discussion about this on my patches - but
atleast on  the platforms I have seen, there was no way to change the
privacy screen out of software / kernel control. Essentially, if there
are hotkeys, they would send an input event to the kernel, who'd send
them to userspace, who'd use the DRM method to toggle the privacy
screen. Thus the current version of the patch only supports
controlling the privacy screen via set() method. The get() method just
returns the cached value.I hope that works for you.

Jani, I'm waiting on your inputs here
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/1/24/1932 in order to send the next
iteration of my patch. Can you please let me know if you have any
comments.

Thanks & Best Regards,

Rajat
