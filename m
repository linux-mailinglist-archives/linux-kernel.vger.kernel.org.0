I didn't realize that SD was used as boot medium for RockPro64, but I
did patch the vendor tree to solve the issue for Tinkerboard, see
https://github.com/rockchip-linux/kernel/commit/a4ccde21f5a9f04f996fb02479cb9f16d3dc8dc0

My initial plan was to patching upstream kernel by adding ->shutdown,but
never finish it.

This RFC also looks good to me, but seems it needs volunteers
to push it again.
