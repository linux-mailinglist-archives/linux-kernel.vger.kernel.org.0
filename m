Then I was indeed a bit confused in the middle of the discussion as
I didn't understand exactly this, thanks for the clarifying :-)

But does it still block when called with GRND_RANDOM ? If so I guess
I'm fine as it translates exactly the previous behavior of random vs
urandom, and that GRND_NONBLOCK allows the application to fall back
to reliable sources if needed (typically human interactions).

Thanks,
Willy
