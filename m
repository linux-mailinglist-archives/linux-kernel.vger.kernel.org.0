I don't recall ever having seen this before. :/ Adding Davidlohr and
Michel who've poked at the rbtree code 'recently'.

If there is only one entry in the tree, then that must also be the
leftmost entry. See your own later question :-)

There are only two places where rb_leftmost are updated,
rb_insert_color_cached() and rb_erase_cached() (the scheduler does not
use rb_replace_nod_cached).

We can 'forget' to set leftmost on insertion if @leftmost is somehow
false, and we can eroneously clear leftmost on erase if rb_next()
malfunctions.

No clues on which of those two cases happened.

Exatly.


I suppose one approach is to add code to both __enqueue_entity() and
__dequeue_entity() that compares ->rb_leftmost to the result of
rb_first(). That'd incur some overhead but it'd double check the logic.
