Well, the bigger question is why use sdw_stream functions at the codec 
level in the first place? All other codec drivers seem to have no issue 
leaving the dais owned by the master control stream state changes.

I am not saying I object or it's bad, just that there were significant 
changes in usages of the 'stream' concept since it was introduced, as 
well as threads in MIPI circles to clarify the prepare/enable 
dependencies, so it'd be useful to have a complete picture of what 
different platforms need/want.
