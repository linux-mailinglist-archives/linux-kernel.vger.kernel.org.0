Sure!

Older versions are harder to find online, unfortunately.  But there is

https://kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages/man-pages-posix/

in which man3p/bcmp.3p says:

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       This function may be withdrawn in a future version.

Finally, the Linux man pages say (man bcmp):

CONFORMING TO
       4.3BSD.   This  function   is   deprecated   (marked   as   LEGACY   in
       POSIX.1-2001): use memcmp(3) in new programs.  POSIX.1-2008 removes the
       specification of bcmp().

Wow.  The difference between memcmp and bcmp is trivial (just the return
value is different, and that costs hardly anything to add).  And memcmp
is guaranteed to exist since C89/C90 at least.

You just have to do the read of the last words you compare as big-endian,
and then you can just subtract the two words, convert that to "int" (which
is very inconvenient to do, but hardly expensive), and there you go.

Or on x86 use the bswap insn, or something like it.

Or, if you use GCC, it has __builtin_memcmp but also __builtin_memcmp_eq,
and those are automatically used, too.
