Yes.  It's "synchronously".  But it will avoid most time-consuming
direct-reclaiming or page lock acquiring, so the latency will not be
uncontrollable.

If hot pages in PMEM is identified via check "A" bit in PTE, there's no
information about which CPU is accessing the pages.  One way to mitigate
is to use the original AutoNUMA.  For example, the hot pages may be
migrated

B -> A: via PMEM hot page promotion
A -> C: via original AutoNUMA

Yes.  Definitely.
