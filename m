Yup, correct.

I'm not sure that reviewing all the applications falls under the scope
of this and/or similar submission. Personally I do not feel comfortable
reviewing Firefox code, for example.

But I do run 2 instances of FF, one for work stuff, one for personal stuff,
so merging its memory would be definitely beneficial for me. I believe I'm
not the only one doing this, and things are not limited to Firefox only, of
course.

Please consider checking a v2 submission I've just posted. It implements
your suggestion on "force_madvise" knob, and I find your feedback very
relevant and useful.

Thanks.
