You do realize that you rely on an update method which *won't* work in
all possible cases and then you *will* have to reboot if the microcode
patching *must* happen early, do you?

I'm not saying you should fix your infrastructure now - I'm saying you
should keep that in mind when thinking whether to rely more on late
loading or not. Who knows, maybe newer generation machines in the fleet
could do load balancing, live migration, whatever fancy new cloud stuff
it is, to facilitate a proper reboot.

Or someone could rewrite arch/x86/ to rediscover new features upon a
microcode reload or a feature disabling. And do that in a clean way. Who
knows...

Yeah, I've heard all the stories.

So how do you update the kernels on those machines? Or you live-patch in
the new functionality too?

The fact that it has worked for you does not make it right. It won't
magically become safe, as tglx said.

But since you do custom development, you should be fine, it seems.

Practically speaking, late loading probably won't disappear as it is
being used apparently. Just don't expect that it will get "extended" if
that extension brings with itself fallout and duct tape fixes left and
right.
