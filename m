I prepared this patch (already some time ago) as part of a series that
was meant to move the ACPI _DSD uuids "prp_guids" in
drivers/acpi/property.c to the drivers instead (so in practice, get
rid of prp_guids). I never send that series out because it would have
only worked with ACPI enumerated devices, so not with for example PCI
enumerated devices which also may have _DSD device properties.

I'm sending this patch out just because after this I'm dropping it
from my development branch. If somebody else finds it useful, great,
let's push it forward, but if there is nobody interested, or if there
is possibly even better way of handling arrays like prp_guids (please
note that I'm not going to work on that ;-), then let's just forget
about the it.

thanks,
