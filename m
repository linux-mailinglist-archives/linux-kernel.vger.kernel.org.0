static int __init dynamic_debug_init(void)
{
        struct _ddebug *iter, *iter_start;
        const char *modname = NULL;
        char *cmdline;
        int ret = 0;
        int n = 0, entries = 0, modct = 0;
        int verbose_bytes = 0;

        if (__start___verbose == __stop___verbose) {
                pr_warn("_ddebug table is empty in a CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG build\n");
                return 1;
        }

...

I wonder if we should just remove it now.

Thanks,
