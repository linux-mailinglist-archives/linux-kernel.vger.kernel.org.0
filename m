I think this was the case from 1992 to commit 84e345e4e209 ("time,
Fix setting of hardware clock in NTP code") in 2013, when we started
taking the time warp into account during the periodic sync_cmos_clock()
call from kernel/time/ntp.c.

As Alexandre keeps pointing out, we really ought to do this from user
space, but in systemd today still relies on the kernel setting the
initial time using CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS, but this breaks e.g.
when the rtc driver itself is a loadable module.

From what I understand it would be easy for systemd to sync the
rtc to system time at boot and let distros disable CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS,
but it still has to do the initial settimeofday(NULL, tz) call to
ensure the correct offset is used for sync_hw_clock() in case
CONFIG_GENERIC_CMOS_UPDATE or CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC
are set (which they tend to be at the moment).

In the long run, a distro can decide to avoid this all, once these
bits come together:

- glibc stops passing the caller timezone argument to the kernel
- the distro kernel disables CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS,
  CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC  and CONFIG_GENERIC_CMOS_UPDATE
- systemd reads the RTC at boot and sets the system
  time according to the configuration in /etc/localtime and /etc/adjtime
- systemd, ntp or something else in user space takes care of the periodic
  rtc update, again taking configuration into account.

When someone mixes today's glibc/systemd/kernel with other
components past that migration, things can go wrong somewhat
annoying but non-fatal ways:
- Users that dual-boot with windows may have to force Windows
  to set the RTC to UTC mode rather than setting Linux to
  localtime.
- if neither the kernel not user space do the periodic RTC update,
  it may be out of sync and cause a larger time jump after the
  next boot time ntp synchronization

Creating a kernel interface for systemd to see or contol how the
11-minute update is done in the kernel would help part of that
transition.
