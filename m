Moin,

Thanks for the report.
Android binderfs is enabled by default on Ubuntu and - iirc - Debian
kernels. It is actively used by Anbox to run Android in containers.

The codepath you're referring to is specific to the stats=global mount
option. This was contributed by the Android team for the 5.4 cycle (cf.
[1]). That means there is no released kernel that supports the
stats=global mount option. So all current users cannot be affected by
this bug.

I'll take a look at this tomorrow and see what makes the most sense. I
agree that this is not a security issue. Thanks for catching this early.

If you already have a script that trivially reproduces the bug it'd be
nice if you could paste it. Otherwise we can just add a reproducer based
on your snippet from below. I want to add a regression test for this.
