Yes, we can take that way too...

Good to know! I am trying not to change the code or abstractions. In the
user-space version I was using the caller address to figure out if it was a call
in the scheduler or not. In the kernel version I am planing to use a
is_sched_function() like approach. But if nothing of that works, I will explore
this possibility, thanks for the suggestion.

Ack, let's see what I can came up.

Thanks!
