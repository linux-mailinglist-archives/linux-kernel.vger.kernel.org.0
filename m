docker and various types(different memory capacity) of containers
are managed by k8s, it's a burden for k8s to maintain those dynamic
figures, simply set "max" to key containers is always welcome.

Set "max" to docker also protects docker cgroup memory(as docker
itself has tasks) unnecessarily.

This patch doesn't take effect on any intermediate layer with
positive memory.min set, it requires all the ancestors having
0 memory.min to work.

Nothing special change, but more flexible to business deployment...
