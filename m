Hi Masami,

Note that Masami has submitted v2 of the patch with further discussion.  I
noticed that I had left some comments unanswered in this thread, so I am
doing this reply before moving on to reply to the v2 thread.

Feel free to move the discussion to v2 instead of replying to this email
if you find that easier.

If you want to put structured data in the command line, then yes, you could use
an ascii safe form, such as base64, to contain it.  If that is what you want.

The quote from the plumbers 2016 devicetree etherpad ("Operating points are OK ...)
conveniently ignores a sentence just a few lines later:

   "If firmware is deciding the operating point, then it's OK to convey it via DT."

The operating points example is clearly communicating boot loader information to
the kernel.

Something the admin or developer wants to communicate is not boot loader
information.

This is debugging kernel drivers.  I do not think that it is a big cost for
a kernel developer to re-link the kernel.  On any reasonable modern
development system this should be a matter of seconds, not minutes.

Compiling a devicetree source is not significantly less time.  (To be
fair, you imply that you would have various compiled devicetrees to
choose from at boot time.  It may be realistic to have a library of
ftrace commands, or it may be more realistic that someone debugging
a kernel driver will create a unique ftrace command set for the
particular case they are debugging.)

Or you can just use the existing ftrace boot command line syntax.

Because the proposal is a mis-use of devicetree.
