Urgh, this code brings back really bad memories :( :( :(

I just ran 5.4 and it looks like we leave everything non-global with KASLR,
even when "kpti=off". Great -- that means we're ok with my patch! Well, we
would be except that when we finalise the linear mapping we'll end up trying
to transition the old non-global entry to global, which is a break-before-make
violation (we panic early in __create_pgd_mapping()).

Staring more at the code, I think we're conflating the global/non-global
mappings with whether or not the kpti trampoline is active and it looks like
this might lead to other issues in mainline right now -- for example, I
don't think we clear TPIDRRO_EL0 properly for native tasks because the
arm64_kernel_unmapped_at_el0() check in tls_thread_switch() will defer the
zeroing to the trampoline code, but that might not even run!

So I've hacked the following, which appears to work but damn I'd like
somebody else to look at this. I also have a nagging feeling that you
implemented it like this at some point, but we tried to consolidate things
during review.

Thoughts?
