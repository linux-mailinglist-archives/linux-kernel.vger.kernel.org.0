So in practice, __OPTIMIZE__ will likely always be set, as far as I
can tell it's supported in GCC, Clang and Intel compilers.  Though
the exception to this is for crypto/jitterentropy.c where the -O0 flag
is unconditionally set.

Are there other exceptions to this in terms of compilers?

Perhaps it may be possible to use BUILD_BUG after all.

Thanks,
