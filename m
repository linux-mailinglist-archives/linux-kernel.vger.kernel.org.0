ok, can do. Will has kindly agreed to have his name added to the 
MAINTAINERS entry (thanks). Other Cc's from ARM community may also be 
interested to be included - shout if so.

So I'll just include tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/arm64 for now.

The code in tools/perf/pmu-events/. should be generic for all 
architectures, while I'd say tools/perf/arch/arm64 is not strictly related.

Thanks,
John
