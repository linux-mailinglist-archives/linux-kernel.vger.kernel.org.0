Hi Sudeep,

Thanks for your response and sharing details about your patch.
<Sudeep>  If so, is kexec/kdump not the mechanism to achieve that?
Qualcomm is having vendor specific solution to capture ram contents and 
for offline analysis.

Here is the background -
Usually, power off drivers are overriding arm_pm_restart and 
pm_power_off callbacks and registering with reboot notifier with  some 
priority for the reboot operations.  Here is the Qualcomm poweroff 
driver for reference.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/power/reset/msm-poweroff.c

Before vendor chip set specific power off driver is probed, 
arm_pm_restart functions pointer holds the psci_sys_reset function. Once 
vendor power off driver is probed,  vendor drivers can override the 
arm_pm_restart function pointer.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/firmware/psci.c#n562

Once vendor driver is probed, drivers can take care of devices warm or 
hard reset configuration part properly.  But there is a window from 
start_kernel() to vendor specific driver probed, devices are getting 
cold resets even if kernel crashed.  This is due to arm_pm_restart 
points to psci_sys_reset function by default.  Is this problem clear 
now?

Qualcomm downstream kernel has a lot of use cases with respect device 
reset sequence and the downstream driver is much different from upstream 
drivers. I think, the above-mentioned problem is common for all the 
chipset vendors and it is not specific Qualcomm use cases.  I have one 
downstream solution to this problem but thought to bring up this problem 
to the upstream community for a common solution, so that all the vendors 
can use it.

I have modified below flow to avoid cold restart in the case of early 
kernel panic.
panic() --> emergency_restart() --> machine_emergency_restart() --> 
machine_restart(NULL);

-Thanks, Prasad
