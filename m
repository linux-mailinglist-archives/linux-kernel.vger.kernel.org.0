Well, we have BPF requirements as well.

Agreed, SRCU works fine for the page-fault case, as the read-side memory
barriers are in the noise compared to page-fault overhead.  Back in
the day, there were light-weight system calls.  Are all of these now
converted to VDSO or similar?

BPF programs that might sometimes sleep, but are usually lightweight.

I will be double-checking this, of course.
