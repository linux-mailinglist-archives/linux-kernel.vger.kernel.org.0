Agreed, I'll add it to my todo list.

So we want to build logic_pio.c for archs which define PCI_IOBASE, but 
there is no specific config option for that.

So that means that this obj will not be included in the vmlinux file for 
!CONFIG_OF (for archs with !PCI_IOBASE or !PCI).

It is an improvement, but I still would like to make the complete change 
and not to build at all for archs which don't define PCI_IOBASE.

It should be possible. We would just need to manage 2 separate logical 
spaces instead of one: a. mmio b. pio

I'm guessing that all the code for logical <-> hw bus address 
translations would be the same.
