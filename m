So indeed that should be a good OS, and Linus probably is a paedophile to b=
e honest.

So get that shit out of your ears and do this.

a religious god! So not surprisingly "Psychosis". Also known as "The Diffic=

 the computer has already happened! And Linus suggests 1000hz timer, when I=
 myself find 90hz timer to be optimal, more like modest BSD settings. Hacke=

c GNU LSD version. To not speak of the horrible pointer variables in LADSPA=
. Did Linux even come much beyond Soundblaster mindset of the early 90s? He=

 acidhouse phenomena was big on computers, and pop-culture and CBM-culture =

e concluded with -10dB RMS masters, 96K processing (80bit for feedback path=
s) and polyphase interpolation, and will promote that. And could even be in=
 a horizontal tracker app, for those wanting that, and polyphase interpolat=
ion does not guess points like a regular interpolator, but rather upsamples=
