Which type of device you suggest here? And which bus it should be
registered to? I think we can make this create a platform_device but
then we would need to do that from the PCI driver as well which seems
unnecessary since we already have the struct pci_dev.

For instance in drivers/mfd/intel-lpss* we use similar approach (the
core part is library that gets called by probe drivers (ACPI, PCI). We
don't create any additional platform_devices.

There is another twist. Ideally we would like to see the SCU IPC probed
and intialized before the MFD children so that we know the SCU IPC is
ready by the time the children devices are created. I guess we could
work it around by returning -EPROBE_DEFER but that does not feel right
to be honest.

Thanks!
