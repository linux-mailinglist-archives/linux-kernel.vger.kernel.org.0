Ok. Thanks for confirming those details.

Just to confirm -- is that writes to the control registers that are
buffered, or is it that buffering of normal memory accesses goes wrong
when the control registers are under heavy load?

Could you explain what you mean by "higher access to PMU register"?

Is there some threshold under which this is guaranteed to be ok? Or is
it probablistic, and we need to minimize accesses at all times?

I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I think it's the wrong
approach.

Depending on the precise conditions under which this happens, I think
that we may be able to solve this entirely within the TX2 PMU driver,
handling all cases and also not breaking multiplexing.

Thanks,
Mark.
