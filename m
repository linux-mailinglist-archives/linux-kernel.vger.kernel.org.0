Agreed, if we extend this to SCSI, satatemp is less than perfect.
drivetemp ? disktemp ? I am open to suggestions, with maybe a small
personal preference for disktemp out of those two.

Fine with me. I wanted to be as restrictive as possible.

Do you have details ? Do I need to add a call to scsi_device_supports_vpd(),
maybe ?

Fine with me. My only concern is that I don't want the driver to disappear
into nowhere-land (again).
