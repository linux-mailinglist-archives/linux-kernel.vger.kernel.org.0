Hi, there are some previous works about this issue, reset PCI devices
in kdump kernel to stop ongoing DMA:

[v7,0/5] Reset PCIe devices to address DMA problem on kdump with iommu
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/cover/343767/

[v2] PCI: Reset PCIe devices to stop ongoing DMA
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/379191/

And didn't get merged, that patch are trying to fix some DMAR error
problem, but resetting devices is a bit too destructive, and the
problem is later fixed in IOMMU side. And in most case the DMA seems
harmless, as they targets first kernel's memory and kdump kernel only
live in crash memory.

Also, by the time kdump kernel is able to scan and reset devices,
there are already a very large time window where things could go
wrong.

The currently problem observed only happens upon kdump kernel
shutdown, as the upper bridge is disabled before the device is
disabledm so DMA will raise error. It's more like a problem of wrong
device shutting down order.
