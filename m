Maybe move it to xhci_bus_state for now.

Yes, before xhci interrupt handler handles the device initiated resume PLS
is XDEV_RESUME and PLC is set.

After the interrupt handler PLS goes from XDEV_RESUME to XDEV_RECOVERY to XDEV_U0.
A bit is set for bus_state->port_remote_wakeup, and on usb core side
also bus->resuming_ports |= bit is set, (having both may be a bit redundant, we might
be able to get rid of bus_state->port_remote_wakeup, but not right now)

Not sure, fortunately the drivers task is to write XDEV_U0 to PLS both when
we want a host initiated resume, or when we want to react on a device initiated
resume. So hopefully that's ok, but this race exists.

Better keep calling completion for both host and device initiated resume cases
when port reaches U0/U1/U2 to avoid waiting for the completion unnecessary,
like you current patch does.
