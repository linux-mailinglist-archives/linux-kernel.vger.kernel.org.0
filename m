Sure.

I could make it a comment instead, but then we loose being able to
parse it. I should probably just reword them to be separate:

"Specifies the height of the physical area where images are displayed.
The property is expressed in millimeters and rounded to the closest
unit."

Also, just realized I need to make these 2 dependencies on either
other (i.e. not valid to only have one).

I'm just happy we have a defined name.
