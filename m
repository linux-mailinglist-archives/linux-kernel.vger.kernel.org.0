Hi all,

Today's linux-next merge of the jc_docs tree got a conflict in:

  Documentation/admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst

between commit:

  46c8a6b4c39e ("smb3: update TODO list of missing features")

from the cifs tree and commit:

  f139291c7130 ("docs: fs: cifs: convert to ReST and add to admin-guide boo=
k")

from the jc_docs tree.

I fixed it up (see below) and can carry the fix as necessary. This
is now fixed as far as linux-next is concerned, but any non trivial
conflicts should be mentioned to your upstream maintainer when your tree
is submitted for merging.  You may also want to consider cooperating
with the maintainer of the conflicting tree to minimise any particularly
complex conflicts.

Cheers,
Stephen Rothwell
