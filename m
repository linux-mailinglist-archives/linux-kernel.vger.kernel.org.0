Subject: [for-next][PATCH 21/21] tracing: Move tracing selftests to bottom of menu
References: <20200130144743.527378179@goodmis.org>

From: "Steven Rostedt (VMware)" <rostedt@goodmis.org>

Move all the tracing selftest configs to the bottom of the tracing menu.
There's no reason for them to be interspersed throughout.

Also, move the bootconfig menu to the top.
