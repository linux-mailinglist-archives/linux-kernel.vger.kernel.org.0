I really like this approach: it actually _simplifies_ the LSM piece in
that there is no need to keep the union and the hook lists in sync any
more: they're defined once now. (There were already 2 lists, and this
collapses the list into 1 place for all 3 users.) It's very visible in
the diffstat too (~300 lines removed):

 include/linux/lsm_hook_names.h | 353 +++++++++++++++++++
 include/linux/lsm_hooks.h      | 622 +--------------------------------
 2 files changed, 359 insertions(+), 616 deletions(-)

Also, there is no need to worry about divergence: the BPF will always
track the exposed LSM. Backward compat is (AIUI) explicitly a
non-feature.

I don't see why anything here is "harmful"?
