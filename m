Yes, Each vendor specific master can have there specific properties 
here, this is just to represent how slave nodes represented w.r.t to 
master nodes.

Point is that this compatible is for slave device, it should not matter 
where and how the slave is connected, compatible should be constant 
irrespective of Link ID.
Lets say for example if WSA881x slave device is connected to a 
single-Link Controller and the same device is connected to a 
MultiLink-controller then we would endup in more than one compatible 
string for WSA881x driver.


 From Disco Specic it clearly says that LinkID values are relative
to the immediate parent Device. So having LinkID in compatible string is 
very fragile.

Am happy to change this to

pattern: "^sdw[0-9a-f][0-9a-f]{4}[0-9a-f]{4}[0-9a-f]{2}$"

if you are okay with rest of the stuff.
