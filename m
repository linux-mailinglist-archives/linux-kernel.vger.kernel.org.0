I suppose that depends where your baseline is.  From the perspective
of "before Kees added this feature", your point of view makes sense.
From the perspective of "what's been shipping for the last six months",
this is a case which has simply not happened before now (or we'd've seen
a bug report).

I don't think you need to change anything for check_page_span() to do
the right thing.  The rodata/data/bss checks will all fall through.
If the copy has the correct bounds, the 'wholly within one base page'
check will pass and it'll return.  If the copy does span a page,
the virt_to_head_page(end) call will return something bogus, then the
PageReserved and CMA test will cause the usercopy_abort() test to fail.

So I think your first patch is the right patch.
