I want to post all the patch you need to apply soon, it is really
painful because they are lot of different branches i have to work
with if you start pulling patches that differ from the below branch
then you are making thing ever more difficult for me.

If you hold of i will be posting all the patches in one big set so
that you can apply all of them in one go and it will be a _lot_
easier for me that way.

This is just something i use to do testing and stack-up all patches.

Like i said above i want to resend all the patches in one big set.

On process thing it would be easier if we ask Dave/Daniel to merge
hmm within drm this cycle. Merging with Linus will break drm drivers
and it seems easier to me to fix all this within the drm tree.

But if you want to do everything with Linus fine.
