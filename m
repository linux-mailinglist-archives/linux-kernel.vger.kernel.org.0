If you can give your reviewed-by and maybe tested-by for that patch that'd be
great.

Yes I will be removing this.

I did actually consider pushing a patch that does just that.

The issue is that I have seen delays in migrating the task to the big CPU,
although the CPU was free. It was hard to hit, but I had runs where the
migration didn't happen at all during the 1s test duration.

I need to use the same overloaded trick in switched_to_rt() too though.

Hmm, I thought this should happen as a side effect of the push/pull functions.

If there are 2 tasks on the same CPU (rq), then it's overloaded and the push
should be triggered anyway, no?

What I'm trying to solve is if a task has woken up on the wrong CPU, or has
just switched to RT on the wrong CPU, then we want to push ASAP.

We can rely on select_task_rq_rt() to do the work, but I have seen big delays
for this to trigger.

I might put this change only for this patch and send the fixes so they can go
before 5.6 is released. Unless the current patch ends up needing few tweaks
only.

Hmm, I accidently inverted the logic too before posting the patch. It should
have been (!has_pushable_tasks).

I saw the loop in push_rt_task[s]() and thought pick_next_pushable_task() is
what dequeues..

Is there another way to know how many tasks are pushable? Or do I need a new
helper?

If we had 2 unfitting tasks; we'll push one and keep one. If we had 2 tasks,
one unfitting and one fitting, then we'll still push 1. I think the dequeue
should have cleared the overloaded state after pushing the first task anyway.

Does this answer your question or were you trying to point out something else?

But what if the big CPU is now free for it to run?

I need to add a similar condition to switched_to_rt() otherwise the
push_rt_tasks() would be a NOP.

Good point.

We can teach the logic not to send IPIs in this case?

Given all of that. I might still agree this might be unnecessary work. So I'll
split it out into a separate patch anyway and send an updated series of the
fixes we agreed on to go into 5.6.

Thanks!
