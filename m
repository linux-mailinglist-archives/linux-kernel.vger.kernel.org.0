Yeah indeed. I tend to sacrifice everything for correctness but perhaps we can live with
small issues like nice accounting not being accounted to the right place if that
can avoid disturbing nohz_full CPUs. Also who cares about renicing a task that is
supposed to run alone.

So here is what I can do: I'll make a simplified version of that set which accounts
on top of the task_nice() value found on accounting time (context switch, user exit,
guest exit) and if some user ever complains, I can still bring back that IPI solution.

Thanks.
