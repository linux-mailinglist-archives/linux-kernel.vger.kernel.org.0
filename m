Exactly. The mailbox controller here is the  SMC/HVC instruction,
which needs 9 arguments to work. The fact that the fist argument is
always going to be same on a platform is just the way we use this
instruction.

Any example of such a security issue?

> The firmware certainly knows the function ID it implements. The firmware =
controls the DT. So it is straight-forward to put the ID into the DT. The f=
irmware could even do this at boot time, dynamically, before passing on the=
 DT to the non-secure world (bootloader or kernel).

At least for flexibility and consistency.

Yes. I overlooked it and actually queued the patch for pull request.
But I think the bindings should not carry a 'fix' patch later. Also I
realise this revision of binding hasn't been reviewed by Rob. Maybe I
should drop the patch for now.

Again, the mailbox controller here is the SMC/HVC _instruction_, which
doesn't care what value the first argument carry.

Cheers!
