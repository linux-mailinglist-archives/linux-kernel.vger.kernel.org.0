Subject: [REGRESSION][BISECTED] 5.5-rc suspend/resume failure caused by
 patch a4f55d8b8c14 ("usb: hub: Check device descriptor before
 resusciation")

I reported this regression last week (see
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/20200115153714.03d5b3aa@EliteBook/T/#u)
but I got no response to my email. Today I have retested with 5.5-rc7
and verified that the problem still exists. So I am resending with a
different subject line to see if anyone responds.

The $subject patch causes a regression on my HP EliteBook laptop with a
built-in USB bluetooth adapter. About 50% of the time, a suspend/resume
cycle will cause the bluetooth adapter to stop working.

The dmesg log below shows two suspend/resume cycles. At time 63.928 you can
see the bluetooth adapter being successfully resumed, and at time 140.969
you can see it fail. After reverting the patch, the bluetooth adapter
resumes 100% of the time.

I also included below a lsusb -v of the bluetooth adapter. Is there any
other debugging info you'd like me to send?

This misbehavior goes back at least to 5.5-rc1.
