They are not relevant to being applied, but this patch series has
changed based on the comments you received from the previous patch(s).
So it is relevant to how you got to this set of patches.

This makes it easier for reviewers to understand what changed and what
they need to focus on, or ignore, in your new set of patches.  This
isn't for you, it is for the people you are sending these patches to.

thanks,
