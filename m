ICSR RETTOBASE bit indicates whether there is any active exception other
than the exception indicated by current value of IPSR. Existing code
already makes use of it to find whether interrupt occurred during
user(thread) mode. Add preemption support in the code path that executes
upon finding an active exception other than the current interrupt.

Having an active exception during interrupt exception indicates that
the interrupt occurred during SVC or PendSV with current Linux exception
setup. On PendSV, interrupts are disabled at exception entry (applicable
to all) & enabled back just before returning from exception. Hence it
has been assumed that active exception during interrupt is indicating
SVC interruption. This would have to be revisited.

With this change, there is some effect, but not enough to make it
usable, this is being debugged.

A simple character driver that does infinite while loop during read was
used to test it as follows (/dev/mymisc corresponds to the node for the
character driver),

A. Before this change,

A.1
~ # cat /dev/mymisc
[   28.099225] mymisc_open
[   28.101625] mymisc_read: enter

command prompt is not usable (expected), interrupts do happen during
this time.

A.2
~ # cat /dev/mymisc &
[1] 39 cat /dev/mymisc
~ # [   11.699880] mymisc_open
[   11.702274] mymisc_read: enter

command prompt is not usable (expected as preemption not supported).

B. After this change,

B.1
~ # cat /dev/mymisc
[   27.374821] mymisc_open
[   27.377349] mymisc_read: enter

though user will not get control back (as expected as it is fg process),
entering on prompt causes new line, doesn't know what to make out of
this behaviour, this doesn't happen in the A.1 case. Interrupts happen
here as well.

B.2
~ # cat /dev/mymisc &
[1] 41 cat /dev/mymisc
~ # [   44.836417] mymisc_open
[   44.838814] mymisc_read: enter

though prompt is available under the control of user, upon typing
anything on the prompt (typed character doesn't get echoed), it crashes
as follows,

[   44.838814] mymisc_read: enter
[   51.710314]

It is a Usage Fault happening while in thread(user) mode. PC & LR in the
dump is strange in the sense that they do not point to text section.

The change here has been made based on how Cortex-A handles preemption.
Since PAN is not applicable and since it seemed that saving & restoring
thread_info::addr_limit does not make difference on the !MMU Cortex-M
due to single address space being used, there was no additional save &
restore of 'dacr' & 'addr_limit' as done in the case of interrupt during
system call on Cortex-A. Also as DUT was UP Cortex-M4, it seemed that
cache related would not affect in anyway w.r.t preemption, as currently
cache is not enabled for M4 in Linux.

As mentioned above, it was assumed that active exception during
interrupt meant SVC was interrupted, though it could have been PendSV as
well. To ensure that issue is not due to interrupt during PendSV, the
PendSV handling of pending work was lifted & sticked onto __irq_entry
and setting PendSV removed as well. Still the behaviour is same.
