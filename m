I understand when a phandle to a syscon is used. That's nothing new. 
What's special about Unisoc SoC that needs something new/different? 
I saw there's a large number of syscons, but I don't understand what's 
in them. 

If the API is this:

struct regmap *syscon_regmap_lookup_by_name(struct device_node *np,                                                    
                                       const char *name,
                                       int arg_count, __u32 *out_args)

How is 'name' being an entry in syscon-names simpler than just being the 
property name? The implementation for the latter would certainly be 
simpler.

It also makes the property unparseable without knowledge outside of the 
DT (i.e. in the driver). I suppose if the number of cells for each entry 
is fixed, we could count the number of syscon-names entries to figure 
out the stride. But then if one entry needs a lot of cells, then they 
all have to have padding cells.
