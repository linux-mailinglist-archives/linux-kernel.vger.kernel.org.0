OK. Based on your and Maxime's response, I'll send them individually.

I can send them as part of our normal pull request. Or did you want this
as a separate topic?

I'll still send out a v2 to cover your review comments.

The bindings had the clocks / clock-names all defined, and the DT all had
the properties, because we had already gone through one rewrite. It's just
the driver didn't follow them properly, because the parents were cross
node / driver, and we had these statically initialized parent name arrays.

I had started work on having the driver rewrite the parents lists based on
fetching clock names via DT, but it was far from elegant. Then this came
up. :)
