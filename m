I am not sure how exactly you mean the conversion.

Anyway, we do not want to use printk_deferred() treewide. It reduces
the chance that the messages reach consoles. Scheduler is an
exception because of the possible deadlocks.

A solution would be to define WARN_ON_DEFERRED() that would
call normal WARN_ON() in printk deferred context and
use in scheduler.
