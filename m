To be honest, the spec explicitly states that minimum submission queue entry size is 64 
and minimum completion entry size should be is 16 bytes for NVM command set:

"Bits 3:0 define the required (i.e., minimum) Submission Queue Entry size when
using the NVM Command Set. This is the minimum entry size that may be used.
The value is in bytes and is reported as a power of two (2^n). The required value
shall be 6, corresponding to 64."

"Bits 3:0 define the required (i.e., minimum) Completion Queue entry size when using
the NVM Command Set. This is the minimum entry size that may be used. The value
is in bytes and is reported as a power of two (2^n). The required value shall be 4,
corresponding to 16."

Pages 136/137, NVME 1.3d.

In theory the spec allows for non NVM IO command set, and for which the sq/cq entry sizes can be of any size,
as indicated in SQES/CQES and set in CC.IOCQES/CC.IOSQES, but than most of the spec won't apply to it.


Also FYI, values in CC (IOCQES/IOSQES) are for I/O queues, which kind of implies that admin queue,
should always use the 64/16 bytes entries, although I haven't found any explicit mention of that.
