This isn't new code, so I'd assume it's been "checked" in the sense of 
"reviewed and tested".

So the lack of an error message could be taken to mean that there's no 
need for an error message.

If you want to stop the compiler complaining about an unchecked return 
value, assuming that it does so, please consider using

	if (request_irq(...))
		pr_debug(...);

That way there is no penalty paid for adding error messages that the 
original author apparently did not want.
