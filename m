I'm just spitballing here since I am about to go to sleep but could we
do something like you did for bee20031772a ("disable -Wattribute-alias
warning for SYSCALL_DEFINEx()") and disable the warning in
DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD_ONSTACK only since we know it is not going to
be a problem? That way, if/when Clang is fixed, we can just have the
warning be disabled for older versions?

Cheers,
Nathan
