This comment doesn't seem to make sense.  If the available bandwidth is
much _larger_ than what is actually used, what's the problem?  You
don't run into difficulties until the available bandwidth is too
_small_.

The extra overhead of a zero-length request should be pretty small.  
After all, the gadget expects to send a packet for every frame anyway,
more or less.

There are two different situations to consider:

	In the middle of a video stream, latency isn't an issue.
	The gadget should expect to send a new packet for each frame,
	and it doesn't know what to put in that packet until it
	receives the video data or it knows there won't be any data.

	At the start of a video stream, latency can be an issue.  But
	in this situation the gadget doesn't have to send 0-length
	requests until there actually is some data available.

Either way, it should be okay.

As far as interrupt load is concerned, I don't see how it relates to
the issue of sending 0-length requests.

Note that on the host side, there is a difference between receiving 
a 0-length packet and receiving no packet at all.  As long as both the 
host and the gadget expect the isochronous stream to be running, there 
shouldn't be any gaps if you can avoid it.
