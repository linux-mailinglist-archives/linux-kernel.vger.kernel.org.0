I see what you mean, and I agree with this principle. That's basically 
why I split the patches into two groups. 

The first group (with comes first) does just the conversion
and renames from txt to rst, adding a :orphan: to the stuff that was
just converted.

On this series, those are patches 1 to 11. I was already expecting
some heat on patch 1.

The next group of patches do the renaming part. Those are the ones that
actually took me a lot more time, as I needed to quickly read several docs
in order to understand what's happening, before proposing a change.

That's also the group of patches were I expect more active comments,
as there are several cases where this is not obvious.

Yet, from what I saw, there are some documents that sounds easy to
move, like Documentation/laptops, with (except if I missed something)
clearly belongs to admin-guide.

Applying the second patch series and patches 2 to 11 from this third
series is, IMHO, a good thing to do.

-

IMO, patches 1 and 12 are important, as, after those patches, the
/Documentation dir becomes a lot cleaner:

Being easy to identify when someone tries to add a new text file there
without thinking on where it would fit[1], and to reorganize the
directory tree in a way that it will fit our needs.

[1] Btw, there are some two files at linux-next, incrementally
    increasing the Documentation/ mess:

	   IPMB.txt and packing.txt.

   Added on those commits:

	    Add support for IPMB driver

	commit 554aae35007e49f533d3d10e788295f7141725bc
	Author: Vladimir Oltean <olteanv@gmail.com>
	Date:   Thu May 2 23:23:29 2019 +0300

	    lib: Add support for generic packing operations

   We'll never finish organizing documents while people don't stop
   adding new files to Documentation/ directory.


Thanks,
Mauro
