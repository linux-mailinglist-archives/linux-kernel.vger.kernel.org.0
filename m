That's okay! I appreciate that you took the time to look at it.

I had not tested with test_kasan.ko. I have been using KUnit to test
KASAN from the beginning so to be completely honest, I hadn't even
learned how to run modules until today.

Great! Thanks for putting time into this.

That would be really helpful, thank you!

I'll need some time to investigate these all myself. Having just
gotten my first module to run about an hour ago, any more information
about how you got these errors would be helpful so I can try to
reproduce them on my own.

I was originally planning on it, but it's not a high priority for me
or my team at this time.
