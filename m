.bss.rel.ro (SHT_NOBITS) is lld specific. GNU ld does not have it. It is
currently used for copy relocations of symbols in read-only PT_LOAD
segments. If a relro section's statically relocated data is all zeros,
we can move the section to .bss.rel.ro

I need to figure out the exact GNU ld rule for input SHT_REL[A] retained
by --emit-relocs.

   ld.bfd: warning: orphan section `.rela.meminit.text' from `arch/x86/kernel/head_64.o' being placed in section `.rela.dyn'
   ld.bfd: warning: orphan section `.rela___ksymtab+__ctzsi2' from `arch/x86/kernel/head_64.o' being placed in section `.rela.dyn'
   ld.bfd: warning: orphan section `.rela___ksymtab+__clzsi2' from `arch/x86/kernel/head_64.o' being placed in section `.rela.dyn'
   ld.bfd: warning: orphan section `.rela___ksymtab+__clzdi2' from `arch/x86/kernel/head_64.o' being placed in section `.rela.dyn'
   ld.bfd: warning: orphan section `.rela___ksymtab+__ctzdi2' from `arch/x86/kernel/head_64.o' being placed in section `.rela.dyn'

lld simply ignores such SHT_REL[A] when checking input section descriptions.
A .rela.foo relocating .foo will be named .rela.foobar if .foo is placed in .foobar

It makes sense for --orphan-handling= not to warn/error.

--orphan-handling was implemented per
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34946
It seems the reporter did not follow up after the feature was implemented.
Now we have the Linux kernel case...
Last December I encountered another case in my company.

It is pretty clear that this feature is useful and we should fix it :)

/PASSTHRU/ sections are still handled as orphan sections?
Do you restrict { } to input section descriptions, not output section
data (https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Output-Section-Data.html#Output-Section-Data)?
or symbol assignments?

You can ask https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2020-02/ whether
they'd like to accept the feature request:)

(My personal feeling is that I want to see more use cases to add the new
feature...)

Confirmed. lld can adapt. I need to do some homework...

Placing N orphan sections requires O(N^2) time (in both GNU ld and lld) :(

Now I learned the term FGKASLR... I need to do some homework.
