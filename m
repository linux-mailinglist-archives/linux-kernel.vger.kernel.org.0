It's probably because the Android Go devices got a lot more "help" from
people at Google than did the other devices you are looking at.  Also,
despite the older kernel version, they are probably running a newer
version of Android userspace, specially tuned just for lower memory
devices.

So those 3.18.y based Android Go devices are newer than the 4.4.y based
"full Android" devices on the market, and even some 4.9.y based devices.

Yes, it is strange :)

Yes, because almost no OEM wants to mess with their kernel, they just
take QCOM's kernel and run with it.  But don't take that for some sort
of "best design practice" summary at all.

QCOM's 4.4.y based kernel work was done 3-4 years ago, if not older.
They didn't know that this was not the "right way" to do things.  The
Google developers have been working for the past few years to do it
correct, but they can not go back in time to change old repos, sorry.

Now that I understand you just want to work on your local device, that
makes more sense.  But I think you will have a better result trying to
do a 4.4 backport of PSI combined with the userspace stuff, than to try
to worry about your driver in 5.2 or newer.

Or you can forward-port your kernel to 4.9, or better yet, 4.14.  That
would probably be a much better thing to do overall as 4.4 is really old
now.

Good luck!
