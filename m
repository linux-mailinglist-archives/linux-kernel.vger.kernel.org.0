Subject: [PATCH 1/1] coredump: fix race condition between collapse_huge_page() and core dumping

When fixing the race conditions between the coredump and the mmap_sem
holders outside the context of the process, we focused on
mmget_not_zero()/get_task_mm() callers in commit
04f5866e41fb70690e28397487d8bd8eea7d712a, but those aren't the only
cases where the mmap_sem can be taken outside of the context of the
process as Michal Hocko noticed while backporting that commit to
older -stable kernels.

If mmgrab() is called in the context of the process, but then the
mm_count reference is transferred outside the context of the process,
that can also be a problem if the mmap_sem has to be taken for writing
through that mm_count reference.

khugepaged registration calls mmgrab() in the context of the process,
but the mmap_sem for writing is taken later in the context of the
khugepaged kernel thread.

collapse_huge_page() after taking the mmap_sem for writing doesn't
modify any vma, so it's not obvious that it could cause a problem to
the coredump, but it happens to modify the pmd in a way that breaks an
invariant that pmd_trans_huge_lock() relies upon. collapse_huge_page()
needs the mmap_sem for writing just to block concurrent page faults
that call pmd_trans_huge_lock().

Specifically the invariant that "!pmd_trans_huge()" cannot become
a "pmd_trans_huge()" doesn't hold while collapse_huge_page() runs.

The coredump will call __get_user_pages() without mmap_sem for
reading, which eventually can invoke a lockless page fault which will
need a functional pmd_trans_huge_lock().

So collapse_huge_page() needs to use mmget_still_valid() to check it's
not running concurrently with the coredump... as long as the coredump
can invoke page faults without holding the mmap_sem for reading.

This has "Fixes: khugepaged" to facilitate backporting, but in my view
it's more a bug in the coredump code that will eventually have to be
rewritten to stop invoking page faults without the mmap_sem for
reading. So the long term plan is still to drop all
mmget_still_valid().
