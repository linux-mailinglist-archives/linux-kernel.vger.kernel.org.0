Yes since I do a lot of work on Bay and Cherry Trail hw enablement I'm
always interested in CHT specific patches.

Overall this series looks good (from a high level view I did not
do a detailed review) but I wonder if we really want to export all the
regulators when we just need the vsdio one?

Most regulators are controlled by either the P-Unit inside the CHT SoC
or through ACPI OpRegion accesses.  Luckily the regulator subsys does not
expose a sysfs interface for users to directly poke regulators, but this wi=
ll
still make it somewhat easier for users to poke regulators which they shoul=
d
leave alone.

Note I'm not saying this is wrong, having support for all regulators in pla=
ce
in case we need it in the future is also kinda nice. OTOH if we just need t=
he
one now, maybe we should just support the one for now ?

Andy do you have an opinion on this?

Andrey, may I ask which device you are testing this on?

Anyways overall good work, thank you for doing this!

Regards,

Hans
