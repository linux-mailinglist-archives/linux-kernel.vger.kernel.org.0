N/A should be allowed to just drop the line entirely, right?

And what does this end up looking like?

I also hate "flag days" where all of a chunk of stuff needs to be
converted into another style.  Also it doesn't deal with merges from the
100+ different trees that all end up adding stuff to this directory over
time (slowly though, unfortunately)

So ideally, I'd like to keep the original format if at all possible.
Having the tool here allows people to do nice things like search for a
specific file easily, or a device type, which is something that I know I
have wanted, and others have asked for in the past as well.

It also might allow us to find out where we are missing documentation, a
long-term goal of mine.
