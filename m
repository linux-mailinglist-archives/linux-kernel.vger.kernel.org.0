It looks like OF graph is required to be used for that. The plan was
actually to propose that we use device properties "usb2-port" and
"usb3-port" that directly reference the port nodes under the USB host
controller, but I guess that's too late for that.

OF graph creates one problem. We are going to need to identify the
endpoints somehow in the USB Type-C drivers, so how do we know which
endpoint is for example the USB2 port, which is USB3, which is
DisplayPort, etc?

Does the remote-endpoint parent need to have a specific compatible
property, like the USB2 port needs to have compatible = "usb2-port"
and so on?

thanks,
