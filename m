Thanks for pointing this out. I think we were using this SPI driver for
cr50 but then we wrote our own version of this driver with the
differences required to make cr50 work properly. I suspect we can drop
this patch, but we've been carrying it forward for a while now, so I'll
have to check with Andrey and others to make sure it's safe to remove.

Right. The burst count we read from cr50 is never going to be larger
than max_xfer_size that we specify in the cr50 driver here, so this is
probably all useless and we can even drop the patch before this one that
adds support for this burst count capping feature.
