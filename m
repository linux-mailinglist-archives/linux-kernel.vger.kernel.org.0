Bird in the hand is worth three in the bush.

You have men contributing to GNU now.
You want to bend them to obey women's speech codes, so you "can get more 
women".
You do not value your male contributors: you take them for granted.

Reasons fewer men contribute to GNU:
Have to reveal identity.
Have to assign copyright (a submissive act).

Reasons very few women contribute to GNU:
Have to reveal identity.
Have to assign copyright.
Too many "loser" men involved.

RMS's previous statements that the woman finds "disgusting" were fine.
I'm sad he walked them back.

Most old religions allowed men to marry young girls.
See: Devarim chapter 22, verse 28.
(Masoretic Text: Na'ar) (Nachmanides points out that a child may be 
called na'ar from the moment he is born.)
(Greek Septuagint: Padia) (padia+philos = paedophillia)
(Latin Vulgate: Puella (young girl))

Bukari Hadiths book 5, hadith number 200+ or so (Ashia's age at 
marriage)

Vedic tradition (father who fails to marry his daughter by 12 or 9 goes 
to a hell)


American men prevent all this, in keeping with their crusade against the 
beliefs of the rest of the world; to bend it into something that is 
"safe" for their "democracy" (white women ruling the world, with her 
unleashed dog (he is leashed and muzzled at home, ofcourse)
Islam will probably win, however, and bring it back. We had hoped the 
Jews would have been successful in doing so, but they were unable to 
bring freedom and have given up now. They tried very hard however (60s, 
70s, 80s), but were violently beaten back by the Proud American Men in 
the latter 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s.

RMS's now-reversed views were perhaps part of that wider liberation 
attempt. But what has he gotten for it? He's given up that attempt now, 
sadly. But what can you do? America only cares about the happiness of 
it's white women: it cares nothing for males who are simply beasts of 
burden to "provide" for the woman, under the American religion. (It 
cares even less for everyone else: who it sets the dogs on)

The Muslims will solve it all, I'm glad the politicians brought them in. 
They also don't rip you off when you get your car fixed: very honest in 
business from my view.

I wish RMS could have a nice marriage.
Ruben Safir: could you help him in that, from your community.
The American Men and Women have attacked him and "canceled" him; after 
all he's done for them.
