Hi Linus,

This is the latest iteration of the kernel lockdown patchset, from Matthew 
Garrett, David Howells and others.

From the original description:

  This patchset introduces an optional kernel lockdown feature, intended 
  to strengthen the boundary between UID 0 and the kernel. When enabled, 
  various pieces of kernel functionality are restricted. Applications that 
  rely on low-level access to either hardware or the kernel may cease 
  working as a result - therefore this should not be enabled without
  appropriate evaluation beforehand.

  The majority of mainstream distributions have been carrying variants of 
  this patchset for many years now, so there's value in providing a 
  doesn't meet every distribution requirement, but gets us much closer to 
  not requiring external patches.

There are two major changes since this was last proposed for mainline:

1. Separating lockdown from EFI secure boot. Background discussion is 
covered here: https://lwn.net/Articles/751061/

2. Implementation as an LSM, with a default stackable lockdown LSM module. 
This allows the lockdown feature to be policy-driven, rather than encoding 
an implicit policy within the mechanism.

A new locked_down LSM hook is provided to

  allow LSMs to make a policy decision around whether kernel functionality 
  that would allow tampering with or examining the runtime state of the 
  kernel should be permitted.

The included lockdown LSM provides an implementation with a simple policy 
intended for general purpose use. This policy provides a coarse level of 
granularity, controllable via the kernel command line:

  lockdown={integrity|confidentiality}

  Enable the kernel lockdown feature. If set to integrity, kernel features 
  that allow userland to modify the running kernel are disabled. If set to 
  confidentiality, kernel features that allow userland to extract 
  confidential information from the kernel are also disabled.

This may also be controlled via /sys/kernel/security/lockdown and 
overriden by kernel configuration.

New or existing LSMs may implement finer-grained controls of the lockdown 
features.  Refer to the lockdown_reason documentation in 
include/linux/security.h for details.

The lockdown feature has had signficant design feedback and review across 
many subsystems.  This code has been in linux-next for some weeks, with a 
few fixes applied along the way.

Stephen Rothwell noted that commit 9d1f8be5cf42 ("bpf: Restrict bpf when 
kernel lockdown is in confidentiality mode") is missing a Signed-off-by 
from its author. Matthew responded that he is providing this under 
category (c) of the DCO.

Several simple conflicts have been identified by Stephen in linux-next:
