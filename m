That is NOT "supported", this is just for avoiding kernel crash as much
as possible.

The nested kprobe can unexpectedly happen, usually in kprobe user handlers.
Also, the critical functions outside of kprobe user handler, are blacklisted
(e.g. [PATCH 2/3]).

Agreed. that must be avoided.

As you may know, kprobes provides a handler interface to user. User must
carefully program the handler which doesn't cause this recursion, but
if he failed, he can put another probe on the function which is called
(indirectly) from the user handler.

The kprobe blacklist. __kprobes and NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() will blacklist it.

Yes, at the beginning of the 2nd BRK hit.
However in the 2nd BRK, it clears the D flag for single-step, and never recover it.

OK. I'm not sure why the original code decided only recovers irq flag.

OK, that is much simpler and easy to understand.

Yes, that must be hold.
