Here we want to protect the global variable console_loglevel 
(console_printk[0]).

Problem may occur when run shell programs like:

echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger &
echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger &
echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger &
..

After above operations are done, console_loglevel may be 7 instead of 
the original log level. I doubt this is what we expect though those 
operations may not be meaningful.

In this case, much info may be output to the terminal for stack info of 
all threads is a lot to print which may cause soft lockup on a 
non-preempt kernel.

Best regards
Kai
