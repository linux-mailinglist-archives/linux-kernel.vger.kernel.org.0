Common Criteria and other security standards I track do not call out for 
anomoly detection. So, there are no requirements on this. That said, we do 
have other anomaly detections because they give early warning that something 
strange is happening. I think adding this event is a nice improvement as long 
as it obeys audit_enabled before emitting an event - for example, look at the 
AUDIT_ANOM_ABEND event.
