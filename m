Sure, there are some examples under Documentation/trace/boottime-trace.rst.
Since the tracefs (ftrace's filesystem user interface) is extensible
by dynamic events and instanses, I need flexibility of option "keys"
not only values, also I need structured settings because some keys
will configure same events or trace instance.
For example, ftrace has tracing instances (which represents different
trace logs) which has some set of configuration parameters. Some
parameters has sub-parameters (trace options), and most parameters
have default parameters. I don't want to make it a single parametarized
options, like ftrace.instance="NAME:OPT1,OPT2:CLOCK:SIZE:SNAPSHOT:...",
because it is not human readable and easy to make mistakes.
Instead, bootconfig solve that with structured, multi-line keys;

ftrace.instance.NAME {
	options = OPT1,OPT2
	trace_clock = CLOCK
	buffer_size = SIZE
	...
}

If we have 3 or more instances, it is easy to expand it as

ftrace.instance {
	NAME1 {
		...
	}
	NAME2 {
		...
	}
	NAME3 {
		...
	}
}

(Hmm, maybe I should reserve "default" name for setting a default configuration)

Sure,

1) write a following bootconfig file
----
kernel {
	# root device and resume devices
	root = /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.0025385481b2fe2a-part2
	resume = /dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.0025385481b2fe2a-part1
	ro			# Mount root device readonly.
	debug			# boot with debug log
	ignore_loglevel	# this will print all messages
	log_buf_len = 16M	# So expand log buffer to 16MB
	no_console_suspend	# Debugging suspend process
	mem_encrypt = off	# Set AMD SME to off
}

init {
	net.ifnames = 0	# Use tradisional ifname
	systemd.log_target = null	# Ignore systemd log?
}
----
2) Use tools/bootconfig/bootconfig to apply it to your initrd image
# tools/bootconfig/bootconfig -a <your-bootconfig> <your-initrd>
3) boot.

Note that I don't intended to "replace" all legacy command line
(but it is easy for bootloaders to use bootconfig) it seems above example
seems have some options which added by the bootloader.

No, (but I HOPE so).

Boot time tracing is just a example. I think we can expand this for some
other subsystems too. And this might be also helpful for adding a bit more
complex syntax to those parameters without parser.
