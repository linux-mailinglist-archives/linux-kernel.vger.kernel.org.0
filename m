If you're not seeing much difference in performance and all your
current testing has been done with 0x00004433, then it is fine to just
stick with that version, the original 0x00004400 values comes from
Allwinner's own SDK, presumably they had a reason for this.

The next step would be sending a non RFC version, with Maxime's Acked-by
added above your Signed-off-by, you may also add my:
