I can't say I totally grok all this, but I'll go digging to try to
better understand it.
I don't believe there is any I2C involved here, so I'll try the
approach you outline above.

Yea, it is strange, and I unfortunately don't know why only USB2 was
exported to the type-c connector.
And to my knowledge, you cannot use both the type-c and hub simultaneously.

Unknown. I don't have any details on that.

So this part was critical to being able to get role switch
notification from the connector and to properly switch modes without
adding extra notifier gunk from the previous patch that folks didn't
like.

Trying to understand further,  your suggestion here is to re-model the
binding, as gpio regulators and gpio muxes, and use a usb-connector
node to describe them,  but I'm missing how I connect that to the
driver implementation I have? Is the idea to extend the rt1711h and
dwc3 drivers further to support the mux/hub bit (this part is fairly
foggy to me), completely removing the need for the misc driver?

I did take an attempt at something similar with an earlier iteration
of the patch set, where I was trying to move the vbus-gpio as a
gpio-regulator to be controlled by the rt1711h/tpcm core, but that
approach didn't work properly and Hans suggested I just go back to the
approach submitted here:
