FWIW, as a first step, my preference would actually be cleaning up the
top level Documentation/ directory. Move every file to an existing or a
new subdirectory, even if just as .txt, or just delete. I understand
this would lead to an extra rst conversion and extension change later,
which you'd like to avoid, but IMO would be helpful.

We could even add an attic directory, which would be a suitable place
for things like zorro.txt. Attic is where I'd look for my old Amiga
hardware, so feels natural.

BR,
Jani.
