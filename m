Then Kconfig should reflect that.

Or, if that's not possible, then you should not break-up and submit
sets which cannot be applied by themselves.  Either submit the whole
set together, or submit them piece by piece, not submitting the next
part until it's predecessor has been applied.

As above.

If you go the whole-patch-set route, yes, either myself or someone
else would have to create an immutable pull-request, but you don't
have to concern yourself with that.
