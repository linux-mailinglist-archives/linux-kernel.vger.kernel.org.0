Hello,

The fixes for what was originally reported as "pathological THP
behavior" we rightfully reverted to be sure not to introduced
regressions at end of a merge window after a severe regression report
from the kernel bot. We can safely re-apply them now that we had time
to analyze the problem.

The mm process worked fine, because the good fixes were eventually
committed upstream without excessive delay.

The regression reported by the kernel bot however forced us to revert
the good fixes to be sure not to introduce regressions and to give us
the time to analyze the issue further. The silver lining is that this
extra time allowed to think more at this issue and also plan for a
future direction to improve things further in terms of THP NUMA
locality.

Thank you,
Andrea
