Good to know, but I want less duct tape, not more.

That's fair.  I've included your suggestions in the commit message of
02/03 of a series I just sent but forgot to in reply to this thread:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/16/1700

Also, I do appreciate the suggestions and understand the value of brainstorming.
