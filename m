I will send a patch to remove that remove that code and use _INFO_
even in legacy mode, it is one of a few command that haven't changed

The sensor_num filed is set the EC.

If the IIO driver knows the cros_sensor_type type, it could retrieve
the sensor_num[s] for all the sensors of that type.
However, the IIO driver itself, does not know which one to use,
another piece of code (cros_ec_dev) must keep track of which sensors
are already take care of.

That code would not be in the EC, but in cros_ec_dev, based on the
result from _DUMP_ and _INFO_ command, if supported by the EC, as you
suggest below.

That would work if we add the requirement on the EC that sensors of
the same type are next to each other in the EC sensor array:
cros_ec_dev would build an array of struct idr, one per type.
IIO driver will recompute the type for a given device based on the
name in the mfd_cell (for instance cros-ec-sensor.c driver handles
accel, gyro and compass), and call back cros_ec_dev for an unused
index.
The EC requirement above is true today, but I see case ti will not
always be true, when some sensors are removed from a BOM while using
the same EC firmware: we will put the optional sensors at the end of
the EC sensors array.

Indeed, I would prefer to keep cros_ec sensor_hub code functionally
equivalent to the hid sensor_hub code with the difference we can not
infer the sensor type from sensor_num (contrary to hid
sensor_id/usageusage_id) and the map {sensor_type, sensor_num] varies
from chromebook to chromebook.
