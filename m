Hi Steve,

For reference, it's a bit more complex than that. :/

Our procedure call standard (the AAPCS) says that the frame record may
be placed anywhere within a stackframe, so we don't have a guarantee as
to where the saved lr will fall w.r.t local variables.

Today, GCC happens to create the stack frame by creating the stack
record, so the LR is saved at a lower addresss than the local variables.

However, I am aware that there are reasons why a compiler may choose to
place the frame record at a different locations, e.g. using pointer
authentication to provide an implicit stack canary, so this could change
in future, or potentially differ across functions.

Maybe that's a bridge we'll have to cross in future.

Thanks,
Mark.
