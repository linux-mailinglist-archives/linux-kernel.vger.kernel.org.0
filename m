Dear Partner.

We want to transfer to overseas ($50.500, 000.00) Fifth Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) from the Bank of Africa, I
want to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or
to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even
an empty account can serve to receive this funds quietly.

I am Dr. Benard Zoungrana, the accountant personal confidant to Mr.
Raymond Beck. Who died together with his wife in a plane crash on
Tuesday, November 2, 1999 on their way to attend wedding in Boston.
Mr. Raymond Beck, is an American, a physician and industrialist, he
died without having any beneficiary to his assets including his
account here in Burkina Faso which he opened in a Bank of Africa in
the year 1994 as his personal savings for the purpose of expansion and
development of his company before his untimely death in 1999.

The amount involved is ($50,500,000.00) Fifth Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars, no other person knows about this account, I am
contacting you for us to transfer this funds to your account as the
beneficiary as foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, without
valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or driver's license and
foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former
owner of the account Mr. Raymond Beck is a foreigner too, and as such
the money can only be approved into a foreign account. However,

I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let
me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I
am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I
will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to
be used for the deposit. I need your full co-operation to make this
work fine. Because the management is ready to approve this payment to
any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I
will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank
official who is deeply involved with me in this business.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 50% of the total
amount 40% will be for me, while 10% will be for expenses both parties
might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward
to your earliest reply.
