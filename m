But does this really help?  After all, the reason we have piled up a
large number of additional callbacks is likely because the grace period
is taking a long time, or because a huge number of callbacks has been
queued up.  Sure, these callbacks might get a head start on the following
grace period, but at the expense of still retaining the kfree_rcu()
special cases in rcu_do_batch().

Another potential issue is interaction with rcu_barrier().  Currently,
rcu_barrier() waits for memory passed to prior kfree_rcu() calls to be
freed.  This is useful to allow a large amount of memory be be completely
freed before allocating large amounts more memory.  With the earlier
version of the patch, an rcu_barrier() followed by a flush_workqueue().
But #3 above would reorder the objects so that this approach might not
wait for everything.

We should therefore just let the second list grow.  If experience shows
a need for callbacks to be sent up more quickly, it should be possible
to provide an additional list, so that two lists on a given CPU can both
be waiting for a grace period at the same time.

It can grow quite large, but how do you know that limiting its size will
really help?  Sure, you have limited the size, but does that really do
anything for the larger problem of extreme kfree_rcu() rates on the one
hand and a desire for more efficient handling of kfree_rcu() on the other?
