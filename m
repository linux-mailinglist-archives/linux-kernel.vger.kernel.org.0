While you can CC me on that, I'm not a kernel maintainer; you should
send patches to the people who maintain the areas of kernel code that
you're modifying. (kernel/cred.c has no specific maintainer; for that
file, I'd probably try sending patches to Andrew Morton, Oleg
Nesterov, David Howells and Eric Biederman, as well as the
linux-kernel@ mailinglist.)

No.

No. Instances of `struct cred` *can* still have an RCU-protected
lifetime; but only certain references to it have RCU semantics.
{task}->cred doesn't have RCU semantics, but {task}->real_cred does
have RCU semantics, and those two can point to the same object.

__rcu annotations mark that a *reference* has RCU semantics. Lack of
__rcu annotation means that the *reference* does not have RCU
semantics, but the object it points to can still have a RCU-protected
lifetime.
