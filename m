The enclave isn't invalid with respect to the hardware ISA or a
potential application or business case need.  It is only invalid with
respect to how a small group of kernel developers have decided that
runtime/application developers, and ultimately their users, should use
hardware that they have purchased and own.

Interestingly, the very antithesis of what started the open source
movement.

If Jethro/Fortanix have a business case for measuring partial pages,
which incidentally he may not be able to divulge at this time, it
seems the driver should support it if the hardware does.

An interesting phenomenon is evolving with respect to Linux.  With
secure boot, kernel module signing, and now the lockdown patches; the
major Linux vendors are in a position to use cryptographic constraints
to limit what the general Linux user community has available to it,
and particularly in the case of SGX, how the Linux application
eco-system can evolve.

I find this situation particularly fascinating.

Intel has choreographed 30+ million dollars of capital investment in
Fortanix in order to advance the development of an SGX software
eco-system.  Given who is authoring the driver, one would think that
the Fortanix engineering desires/needs would be given careful
consideration before the hardware capabilities are limited by the
driver ABI, an ABI that will be subsequently cryptographically
constrained from innovation.

My apologies in advance for any intended or perceived indelicacies on
these issues.

Have a good weekend.
