You also have to iterate over them all later in the same function.  The the
free counts are per migrate type then they would have to be iterated over
every time.

Similarly, there would be multiple places where all the counters would
have to be iterated -- find_suitable_fallback, show_free_areas,
fast_isolate_freepages, fill_contig_page_info, zone_init_free_lists etc.

It'd be a small cost but given that it's aimed at fixing a problem with
reading pagetypeinfo, is it really worth it? I don't think so.

Again, the cost is when reading a proc file. From what Andrew said,
the lock is necessary to safely walk the list but if anything. I would
be ok with limiting the length of the walk but honestly, I would also
be ok with simply deleting the proc file. The utility for debugging a
problem with it is limited now (it was more important when fragmentation
avoidance was first introduced) and there is little an admin can do with
the information. I can't remember the last time I asked for the contents
of the file when trying to debug a problem. There is a possibility that
someone will complain but I'm not aware of any utility that reads the
information and does something useful with it. In the unlikely event
something breaks, the file can be re-added with a limited walk.
