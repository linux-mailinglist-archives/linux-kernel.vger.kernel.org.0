Subject: [PATCH 16/16] perf tools: Add support for leader-sampling with AUX area events

When AUX area events are used in sampling mode, they must be the group
leader, but the group leader is also used for leader-sampling. However,
it is not desirable to use an AUX area event as the leader for
leader-sampling, because it doesn't have any samples of its own. To support
leader-sampling with AUX area events, use the 2nd event of the group as the
"leader" for the purposes of leader-sampling.

Example:

 # perf record --kcore --aux-sample -e '{intel_pt//,cycles,instructions}:S' -c 10000 uname
 [ perf record: Woken up 3 times to write data ]
 [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.786 MB perf.data ]
 # perf report
 Samples: 380  of events 'anon group { cycles, instructions }', Event count (approx.): 3026164
