Yes: no doubt PageDoubleMap could be fixed on shmem+file, but I have no
interest in doing that, because it's just unnecessary overhead for them.
(They have their own overhead, of subpage mapcounting for pmd: which is
something to eliminate and unify with anon when I get around to it.)

Please do! One less for me to worry about, thanks.

Absolutely. There remain a few other uses of PageTransCompoundMap
anyway, and I really wanted this outright mm fix to go in before
re-submitting AndresLC's KVM patch (I'll ask a KVM-savvy colleague
to take that over, Cc'ing you, once the mm end is correct).
