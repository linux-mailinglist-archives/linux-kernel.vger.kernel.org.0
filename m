From a user perspective this isn't a meaningful distinction.

If I partition my memory among containers and one cgroup is acting
out, I would want the culprit to be charged for the cpu cycles the
reclaim is causing. Whether I divide my machine up using memory.low or
using memory.max doesn't really matter: I'm choosing between the two
based on a *memory policy* I want to implement - work-conserving vs
non-conserving. I shouldn't have to worry about the kernel tracking
CPU cycles properly in the respective implementations of these knobs.

So kswapd is very much a cgroup-attributable activity, *especially* if
I'm using memory.low to delineate different memory domains.

The limiting factor on the consumer side is IO. Reading a page is way
more costly than reclaiming it, which is why we built our isolation
stack starting with memory and IO control and are only now getting to
working on proper CPU isolation.

I understand your concern about CPU cycles escaping, and I share
it. My point is that this patch isn't adding a problem that isn't
already there, nor is it that much of a practical concern at the time
of this writing given the state of CPU isolation in general.
