Exactly my point; so sometimes it fails creation and sometimes if fails
running. So now we have two failiure cases instead of one and the
reason might not always be evident.

Which makes the whole thing even more random.

There's nothing preventing the cpuc you're looking at changing while
you're looking at it. Heck, afaict it is possible to UaF here. Nothing
prevents the events you're looking at from going away and getting freed.
