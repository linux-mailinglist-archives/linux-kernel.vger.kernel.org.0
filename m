OK, let me show how complicated and confusing this looks for me:

  + The two related barriers are in different source files
    and APIs:

       + assign_desc() in ringbuffer.c; ringbuffer API
       + _dataring_pop in dataring.c; dataring API

  + Both the related barriers are around "id" manipulation.
    But one is in dataring, other is in descriptors array.
    One is about an old released "id". One is about a newly
    assigned "id".

  + The release() barrier is called once for each assigned
    descriptor. The acquire() barrier is called more times
    or not at all depending on the amount of free space
    in dataring.

  + prb_getdesc() is mentioned in the comment but the barrier
    is in _dataring_pop()

  + prb_getdesc() is called via dr->getdesc() callback and thus
    not straightforward to check.

  + dr->getdesc() is called twice in _dataring_pop(); once
    with _acquire() and once without.

  + _acquire() is hidden in
    desc = dr->getdesc(smp_load_acquire(&db->id), dr->getdesc_arg)

  + The comment says that it is pairing with smb_rmb() but it
    the code uses _acquire().

  + The comment says that the barrier is issued "so that callers can
    see all data ringbuffer updates". It is not specific what
    updates are meant (earlier or later).

    It can be guessed by the the type of the barrier. But it does
    help with review (barrier matches what author wanted).


What would have helped me to understand this barrier might
be something like:

	/*
	 * Got descriptor and have exclusive write access.
	 * Use _release() barrier before first modification
	 * so that others could detect the new owner via
	 * previous numlist and dataring head/tail updates.
	 *
	 * The related barrier is in _dataring_pop() when
	 * acquiring db->id.
	 */

It explains what the barrier is synchronizing and where is
the counter part.

But it still does not explain if the counter part is correct.
I simply do not know. Barriers are usually symmetric but the
only symmetric thing here is the name of the variable ("id").

It might be correct after all. But it looks so non-standard
and far from obvious at least for me. I hope that we could
either make it more symmetric and better explain it.

Sure. It is possible that this is the worst place. But there are definitely
more of them:

  + smp_rmb() in numlist_read() is related to smp_wmb() in prb_reserve()
  + "node" callback in struct nl_node must do smp_wmb()
  + full memory barrier is required before calling get_new_lpos()

I think that I understand the overall algorithm in principle. But it
is really hard to prove that all pieces play well together.

I would like to discuss the overall design in a separate thread.
I wanted to comment and understand some details first.

It is clear that you put a lot of effort into it. Also it is great
that you tried to formalize the barriers. But it is still very
complicated.

I try hard to understand the think from different angles. I started
with numlist.c and there was quite some dependency on the rest.
Then I started to check the overall algorithm and saw even more
points that synchronized against more locations or synchronized
against another structures.

I do not know. I am going to stare more into it. It is possible
that I will get on top of it in the end.

I'll also try to apply the patch adding my approach. I wonder
if it makes a difference.
