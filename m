Hi Greg,

Thanks for posting this driver.

But I would like to mention that the openwrt community is currently  
working on a
new version which is based a newer version of the MediaTek vendor driver.
That version is currently targeted for the openwrt 4.19 kernel.
See full pull request [1] and NAND driver patch [2]

It would be a shame if duplicate work has been done.

Greats,
