Since the format of the test events table is slightly different to 
regular event tables, I wasn't sure on the value there. But I could add it.

For that, I could modify how we generate pmu-events.c as to not have a 
separate special test table, but add the test events as a special entry 
in pmu_events_map[], with some fake test cpuid. That could be better if 
we want to verify the generated test event table.

I'm going to look at what I can do here. I just worry it will make 
things more arch specific and make the test brittle.

So just going back to the uncore events now, since they have the "Unit" 
property to match to specific uncore PMUs, we need to test them slightly 
differently to core PMUs. But I have improved the testing for that now.

Thanks,
John
