New lock chains are stored as part of the validate_chain() call from
__lock_acquire(). So for a n-entry lock chain, all previous n-1, n-2,
... 1 entry lock chains are stored as well. That may not be the most
efficient way to store the information, but it is simple. When booting
up a 2-socket x86-64 system, I saw about 800 1-entry lock chains being
stored.

Since I am planning to enforce a minimum of 2 chain_hlocks entry
allocation, we can theoretically allow a 1-entry chain to share the same
storage with a 2-entry chains with the same starting lock. That will add
a bit more code in the allocation and freeing path. I am not planning to
do that for this patchset, but may consider it as a follow up patch.

Cheers,
Longman
