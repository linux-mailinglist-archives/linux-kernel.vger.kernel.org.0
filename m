What I meant is that in contrast to a block driver the SMC interface is a shared resource. The mailbox controller is just using a tiny part of that. We must make sure to not interfere with the other services offered by firmware.

As I wrote we can't safely use a bare smc call. We must comply with the SMCCC, because there are a possible multitude of services the firmware offers. PSCI is a one obvious example.
And SMCCC says:
When an SMC32/HVC32 call is made from AArch32:
   • A Function Identifier is passed in register R0.
   • Arguments are passed in registers R1-R6.
   • Results are returned in R0-R3.
...
(similar for SMC64)

So arguments start from r1/x1.

There are *two* protocols to consider here:
One is the outer SMCCC protocol, which establishes communication between the mailbox controller driver and the firmware. SMCCC defines very precisely the meaning of r0/w0 for that, but leaves the rest (x1-x6) to the user. Think of the function ID being the equivalent of an MMIO base address. You can use it to select several instances of one type of mailbox. It's the task of the controller driver to abstract from that. Surely you wouldn't provide the MMIO base address of the particular mailbox in the client's DT node.

The *client* protocol is then wrapped inside this, using the six argument registers that SMCCC gives us. This is indeed up to the client to use and it dictates its meaning.

Maybe there is some misunderstanding that this mailbox is really a SMCCC mailbox rather than a pure SMC mailbox? Should we use a different naming like smccc_mailbox or firmware_mbox instead?

"Service" is the term used for a "group of functions". PSCI is one service, for instance. It's typically determined by some upper bits. Inside this service there are several functions, like CPU_ON or SYSTEM_RESET, typically using low order bits.
In our case the service is the mailbox, and there is just one function, the actual doorbell. We could have introduced more functions (like disocvery, information or statistics), but there is no real need for that.

Cheers,
Andre.
