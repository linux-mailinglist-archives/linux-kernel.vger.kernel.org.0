Ah, I see - a different case to the one originally reported but also an
issue.

The whole area is just a mess.

I'd need to go back and retest to confirm but it looks like always had
the issue that we'd install some nG mappings early even with KPTI
disabled on the command line so your change is just restoring the
previous behaviour and we're no worse than we were before.
