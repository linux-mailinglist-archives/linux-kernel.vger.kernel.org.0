Sure, but if userspace was relying on the non-zero values, it's now broken.

What's missing from the patch description is the fact that this register is
RAZ is SVE is not supported. Given that we get both the SVE HWCAP and
PFR0.SVE field correct when the CONFIG option is disabled, then it's only
very dodgy userspace which would parse the information in ZFR0 for this
configuration and I think we can make this change as a bug fix. I'll try to
write something sensible.
