I realize that "it's the holidays", but it'd be a shame if this gets 
forgotten :(


# uptime; dmesg | grep -c 2038
 14:45:15 up 6 days, 21:16,  1 user,  load average: 0.20, 0.22, 0.27
350

Attached is a "fix" that changes pr_warn into pr_debug, but that's maybe 
not what was intended here.


Thanks,
Christian.


commit c9a5338b4930cdf99073042de0717db43d7b75be

    Commit f8b92ba67c5d ("mount: Add mount warning for impending timestamp expiry") resp.
    0ecee6699064 ("fix use-after-free of mount in mnt_warn_timestamp_expiry()") introduced
    a pr_warn message and the following gets sent to dmesg on every remount:
    
     [...] filesystem being remounted at /mnt supports timestamps until 2038 (0x7fffffff)
    
    When file systems are remounted a couple of times per day (e.g. rw/ro for backup
    purposes), dmesg gets flooded with these messages. Change pr_warn into pr_debug
    to make it stop.
