Yeah, so we experimented with changing the interrupt handling in the 
SCSI driver I maintain to use a threaded handler IRQ handler plus patch 
below, and saw a significant throughput boost:

--->8

Subject: [PATCH] genirq: Add support to allow thread to use hard irq 
affinity

Currently the cpu allowed mask for the threaded part of a threaded irq
handler will be set to the effective affinity of the hard irq.

Typically the effective affinity of the hard irq will be for a single
cpu. As such, the threaded handler would always run on the same cpu as
the hard irq.

We have seen scenarios in high data-rate throughput testing that the
cpu handling the interrupt can be totally saturated handling both the
hard interrupt and threaded handler parts, limiting throughput.

Add IRQF_IRQ_AFFINITY flag to allow the driver requesting the threaded
interrupt to decide on the policy of which cpu the threaded handler
may run.

As Ming mentioned in that same thread, we could even make this policy 
for managed interrupts.
