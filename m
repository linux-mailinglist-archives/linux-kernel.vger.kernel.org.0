I understand this partly now!

This can be probably made better/clear by:
renaming sdw_master_device_add to sdw_master_alloc and do a 
device_initialize() as part of this function in subsequent call to 
sdw_add_bus_master() we can do a device_add(). Doing this way will avoid 
a bit of unnecessary call to device_unregister by the controller driver, 
tbh which is confusing.

If the intended call sequence for controller is this (by keeping the 
parent bus type intact):

sdw_master_alloc/sdw_master_device_add()
sdw_add_bus_master()

Then we should also remove sdw_unregister_master_driver() and 
module_sdw_master_driver() all together. Having them makes the reader 
think that they can use module_sdw_master_driver directly without any 
parent bus like platform bus in this case.

Why would this even need to be in the SoundWire core layer, if parent 
can call its local startup function whenever its necessary?
Unless we have some kinda state-machine in the core which can really 
deal with this, i see no point in this callback.
