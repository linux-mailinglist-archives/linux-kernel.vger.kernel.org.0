Ah now I understand you concern. I guess the question is what is the =0A=

As implemented right now the loop will stop at the first locked block. =0A=
So if the range starts in a unlocked block and spans into a locked one =0A=
the return value will be 1.=0A=
=0A=
Is that correct? Well do_ppb_xxlock and  do_getlockstatus_oneblock seem =0A=
to only care about the first block (they both ignore len)? So they'd =0A=
return 0 in the case of unlocked,locked.=0A=
=0A=
stm_is_locked_sr does about the len and will return 0 if len falls =0A=
outside the locked region or if ofs starts before the locked region.=0A=
=0A=
So here's a quick breakdown=0A=
=0A=
                  ppb_is_locked intelext_is_locked stm_is_locked concat=0A=
unlocked,unlocked            0                  0             0      0=0A=
locked,locked                1                  1             1      1=0A=
locked,unlocked              1                  1             0      1=0A=
unlocked,locked              0                  0             0      1=0A=
=0A=
I'll try and make concat_is_locked consistent with the two cfi =0A=
implementations.=0A=
=0A=
Thanks for your feedback on this. I think the v2 series should look a =0A=
lot better as a result.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
