As Daniel mentioned in that discussion your typical userspace
assumes that it can use a single unscaled framebuffer with any
advertised mode. Hence I believe limiting the mode list based
on the max framebuffer size is pretty much required unless
you want to break existing userspace.

In i915 I went a bit further than that recently and now we
filter the mode list based on the maximum plane size [1] 
(which can be less than the max fb size and less than the
maximum crtc dimensions). And again that's because userspace
assumes that it can just use a single unscaled fullscreen
plane to cover the entire crtc.

These assumption are also carved into the legacy setcrtc uapi
where you can't even specify multiple framebuffers. In theory
a driver could internally use multiple planes to overcome some
of the limitations, but in i915 at least we don't.

I think a safe way to relax these rules would be to either:
a) Add a client cap by which userspace can inform the kernel
   it understands there are more complicated limits at play
   and thus can't assume that everything will just work
b) Maybe we could just tie that in with the atomic cap since
   atomic clients are pretty much required to do the TEST_ONLY
   dance anyway, so one might hope they have a working fallback
   strategy. Though I suspect eg. the modesetting ddx wouldn't
   like this. But we no longer allow atomic with X anyway so
   that partcular argument may not hold much weight anymore.
