I built the tip of linux-5.1.y and reproduced the issue while trying to=20
log out and back into Steam; it exhibited this symptom as well:

pgriffais@pgriffais:~$ nstat -az | grep -i wqueue
TcpExtTCPWqueueTooBig           31                 0.0

I applied Eric's path to the tip of the branch and ran that kernel and=20
the bug didn't occur through several logout / login cycles, so things=20
look good at first glance. I'll keep running that kernel and report back=20
if anything crops up in the future, but I believe we're good, beyond=20
getting distros to ship this additional fix.

Thanks,
