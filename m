OK, I have misread your response then. Because you were saying that the
above example is perfectly fine while it actually matches your example
of low, mid, high prio example so I was confused.

[...]

I am skipping the large part of your response mostly because I believe
it would make it easier to move this forward.

Yes, makes sense. A subsection about examples/best practices/Lessons
learned where we can add more sounds like a very good thing in general.
Because regardless of what tends to work for some deployments it is
always good to give examples of what hasn't worked for others and was
non trivial to find out. This can save countless of hourse for other
people.
