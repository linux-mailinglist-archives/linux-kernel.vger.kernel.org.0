Hi

The kernel changes for AUX area sampling are now in tip, so here are the
tools' patches.

AUX area sampling allows bytes from a AUX area buffer to be copied onto
samples of other events.

Here is the Intel PT documentation from patch "perf intel-pt: Add support
for recording AUX area":

  perf record AUX area sampling option
  ------------------------

  To select Intel PT "sampling" the AUX area sampling option can be used:

  	--aux-sample

  Optionally it can be followed by the sample size in bytes e.g.

  	--aux-sample=8192

  In addition, the Intel PT event to sample must be defined e.g.

  	-e intel_pt//u

  Samples on other events will be created containing Intel PT data e.g. the
  following will create Intel PT samples on the branch-misses event, note the
  events must be grouped using {}:

  	perf record --aux-sample -e '{intel_pt//u,branch-misses:u}'

  An alternative to '--aux-sample' is to add the config term 'aux-sample-size' to
  events.  In this case, the grouping is implied e.g.

  	perf record -e intel_pt//u -e branch-misses/aux-sample-size=8192/u

  is the same as:

  	perf record -e '{intel_pt//u,branch-misses/aux-sample-size=8192/u}'

  but allows for also using an address filter e.g.:

  	perf record -e intel_pt//u --filter 'filter * @/bin/ls' -e branch-misses/aux-sample-size=8192/u -- ls

  It is important to select a sample size that is big enough to contain at least
  one PSB packet.  If not a warning will be displayed:

  	Intel PT sample size (%zu) may be too small for PSB period (%zu)

  The calculation used for that is: if sample_size <= psb_period + 256 display the
  warning.  When sampling is used, psb_period defaults to 0 (2KiB).

  The default sample size is 4KiB.

  The sample size is passed in aux_sample_size in struct perf_event_attr.  The
  sample size is limited by the maximum event size which is 64KiB.  It is
  difficult to know how big the event might be without the trace sample attached,
  but the tool validates that the sample size is not greater than 60KiB.
