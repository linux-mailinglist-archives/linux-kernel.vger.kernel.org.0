I agree here ...

... but not here, necessarily. These register names make it look like
this is the wrong place.

On the other hand, if you don't actually have a way to disable power to
the GPU domain, it is a bit hard for me to argue that it would be more
correct to place this in a power domain driver. Certainly the power
domain driver could (de)assert the reset in the right order though.

I notice the actual GPU reset seems to be MEDIA_G3D, and is deasserted
after whatever is controlled via AO_SCTRL_SC_PW_* in [1], so maybe this
is indeed just the power domain control?

The comment

  "Note: GPU DVFS is not implemented and a custom Device Tree
         entry is needed by these platform files.  This is a
         first working version that needs to be improved."

doesn't exactly make it clear whether it is "not implemented" in the
SoC, not implemented on the board, or just not implemented in the driver
in this patchset.
So even if this board has the regulator fixed, could there be others
where GPU power could be switched off? I wouldn't want to encode the the
limitations of a particular board into the SoC DT bindings.

Is this the only reset register in the "Always-On" (that would have been
nice to include in the commit description for my education) controller?

According to [3] there also seem to be rst4 and rst5 registers?

[3] https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/arch/arm/include/asm/arch-hi6220/hi6220_regs_alwayson.h

Where does this number come from? I can't find any information about the
bits in the PW_* registers...

I'm sorry, I missed that.

Ok, that makes sense.

I'm just asking whether you have considered potential side effects, but
without better knowledge about the SoC, following the order found in the
vendor code, is probably the best we can do.

In [1] the corresponding _STAT registers (+0x8) are checked after
setting each bit, is there a reason you dropped these checks?

Philipp
