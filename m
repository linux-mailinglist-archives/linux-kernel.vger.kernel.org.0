I guess that we might read a garbage here before dataring_push()
writes an invalid ID after it shuffled dr->head_lpos.

I am not completely sure how we detect the garbage. prb_getdesc()
might reach a valid descriptor just by chance. My understanding
is below.

I believe that this check should be enough to detect the garbage
or non-initialized db->id.

All descriptors are reused regularly. It means that all descriptors
should contain only valid or recently used lpos values. In each case,
there should not be any risk of overflow.

The only exception might be never used descriptors. Do we detect them?

Did I miss anything, please?

I guess that this is related to WRITE_ONCE(db->id, id - 1) in
dataring_push(). It does not harm. But I would like to be sure
that I understand it correctly.

So, is there any chance that this check fails? IMHO, the previous
checks should catch all invalid descriptors.

Instead we might need to add a check to detect a never used
descriptor. Or is it already detected?

Might id == 0, begin_lpos == 0, next_lpos == 0 be valid values
by chance?

What if a never used descriptor has been just assigned on another CPU
and being modified?

This would deserve a more detailed comment. Where the garbage can be
seen and how it is detected. I guess that it is in _dataring_pop()
that is being discussed above. Is it really needed?
