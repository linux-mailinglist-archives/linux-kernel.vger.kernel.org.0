Yes, it's the latter case, SOF will be the only driver supporting DMICs 
on CometLake, so it'd be better to avoid creating a conflict with SOF or 
enabling a configuration by default which is known to have restrictions. 
It's fine to add the CML IDs, but better avoid adding CML under the 
SKYLAKE all-you-can-eat selector.
