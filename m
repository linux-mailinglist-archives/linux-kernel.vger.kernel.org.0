Hi Tejun,

The regression I'm talking about here is that CONFIG_CPUSET=y changes the
behavior of the sched_setaffinify system call, which existed prior to
cpusets.

sched_setaffinity should behave in the same way for kernels configured with
CONFIG_CPUSET=y or CONFIG_CPUSET=n.

The fact that cpuset decides to irreversibly change the task affinity mask
may not be considered a regression if it has always done that, but changing
the behavior of sched_setaffinity seems to fit the definition of a regression.

Thanks,

Mathieu
