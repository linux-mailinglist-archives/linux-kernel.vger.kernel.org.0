REV JAMES ABEL OF
FIRST BANK OF NIGERIA LTD
35 Marina P. O. Box 5216,
LAGOS- NIGERIA.

Dear Honest Partner.

I need your assistance to transfer the sum of $7.500.000.00 Million Dollars out of my bank to a foreign country.This fund has been dormant for a very long time and my bank does not know about it.I will put your name as the real owner of this fund and i will present you to the bank.

At the end of the successful transfer of this fund to your bank account.We are to share it 70% 30%.70% for you and 30% for me.I will come down to your country and receive my own share of the fund to avoid any detection from my bank and government.

However,all i need is a trustworthy person.Reply me with your direct phone number and country of origin so that i can call you and brief you more about this transaction.

Please note that,this transaction is risk free and safe,because i have all the documents as proof.

Yours truly,
Rev. James Abel
