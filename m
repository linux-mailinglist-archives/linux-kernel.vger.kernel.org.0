All right. There could be me who have this misunderstanding.=20

Anyway, I think now we all agree it's only a boot-time restriction on
the system RAM.

Btw, as you said at above, I am confused by the '[KNL,BOOT]', what does
the 'BOOT' mean in the documentation of 'mem=3D'? I checked all parameters
with 'BOOT', still don't get it clearly.
