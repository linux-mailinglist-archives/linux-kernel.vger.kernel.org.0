Ack, will fix.

ok, will use is_sdw_master_device.

I must admit I don't understand the question. This is literally modeled 
after is_gb_host_device(), did I miss something in the Greybus 
implementation?

I will remove, it cannot happen.

I don't recall this was the guidance but fine.

This was modeled after gb_hd_create ;-)

sdw_master_device_add starts to be on the long side, no?

yes, this function is called as part of the parent probe.

Ah, yes, this is clearly wrong, thanks for pointing this out.

What's the recommended error code for this? Greybus uses:

return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);

yes, will fix

SoundWire bus driver. This is a copy/paste from the SOF code I am

yes, I used kerneldoc everywhere except here, will fix.
