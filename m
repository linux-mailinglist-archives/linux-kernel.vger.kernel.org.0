Thanks for the responses.

I am looking into how much of our allocation pattern details I can share.

My general understanding is that this issue occurs on a 32bit devices 
which have additional restrictions on the IOVA range they can use within those 
32bits.

An example is a use case which involves allocating a lot of buffers ~80MB 
is size, the current algorithm will require an alignment of 128MB for 
those buffers. My understanding is that it simply can't accommodate the number of 80MB 
buffers that are required because the of amount of IOVA space which can't 
be used because of the 128MB alignment requirement.

My concern with using CONFIG_CMA_ALIGNMENT alignment is that for us this 
would either involve further fragmenting our CMA regions (moving our CMA 
max alignment from 1MB to max 2MB) or losing so of our 2MB IOVA block 
mappings (changing our IOVA max alignment form 2MB to 1MB).

At least for us CMA allocations are often not DMA mapped into stage 1 page 
tables so moving the CMA max alignment to 2MB in our case would, I think, 
only provide the disadvantage of having to increase the size our CMA 
regions to accommodate this large alignment (which isn¢t optimal for 
memory utilization since CMA regions can't satisfy unmovable page 
allocations).

As an alternative would it be possible for the dma-iommu layer to use the 
size of the allocation and the domain pgsize_bitmap field to pick a max 
IOVA alignment, which it can pass in for that IOVA allocation, which will 
maximize block mappings but not waste IOVA space?
