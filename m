What do you mean by "globally"? The /delete-property/ operator just 
removes a previously-defined property from the node in which it appears.

Right, and having invalid "dma-names" properties for this board is what 
happens to trick Linux into not using DMA mode via 
of_dma_request_slave_channel() failing, yes? What I'm saying is that if 
the underlying justification is that it's not worth using DMA mode at 
all on this board, then suppressing the actual "dmas" property it its 
DTS such that there's no dependency on a particular driver behaviour is 
a lot more robust.
