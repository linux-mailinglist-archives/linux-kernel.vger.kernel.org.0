Thank you for the detailed analysis. I'll try my best and send you a
patch. But before I start I want to make sure one thing. The changes
done by the commit you mentioned (which introduced non_rcu flag), should
be now reverted, right?  Since, prior to the commit RCU semantics were
there and RCU was being used (which was unnecessary) and the fix merely,
removed these (unnecessary) RCU usages (with checks to either use them
or not, but now we actually don't use RCU for subjective credentials).

So, now what's left is the unused RCU code (which needs to be removed)
and the changes done in the temporary fix (which would be reverted since
we don't want to use RCU).

Thanks
Amol
