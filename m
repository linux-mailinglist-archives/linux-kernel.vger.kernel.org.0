From: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@infradead.org>

Since Non-standard serial port drivers are also Serial drivers,
move the "Non-standard serial port support" menu to be under/in
the "Serial drivers" menu. With this move, the "Serial drivers"
menu contains (a) 8250/16550 support, (b) non-8250 support, and
(c) non-standard serial port support.
