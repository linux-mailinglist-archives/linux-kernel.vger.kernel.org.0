Trying to wrap my brain around the concept, this series seems to be
adding the ability to declare that an apparent dependency (eg an IRQ
specified by a phandle) is _not_ actually a dependency.

The phandle already implies the dependency.  Creating a separate
depends-on property provides a method of ignoring the implied
dependencies.

This is not just hardware description.  It is instead a combination
of hardware functionality and driver functionality.  An example
provided in the second paragraph of the email I am replying to
suggests a device could operate in polling mode if no IRQ is
available.  Using this example, the devicetree does not know
whether the driver requires the IRQ (currently an implied
dependency since the IRQ phandle exists).  My understanding
of this example is that the device node would _not_ have a
depends-on property for the IRQ phandle so the IRQ would be
optional.  But this is an attribute of the driver, not the
hardware.  This is also configuration, declaring whether the
system is willing to accept polling mode instead of interrupt
mode.

Devicetree is not the proper place for driver description or
for configuration.

Another flaw with this method is that existing device trees
will be broken after the kernel is modified, because existing
device trees do not have the depends-on property.  This breaks
the devicetree compatibility rules.

The above issues make this specific implementation not acceptable.

I like the analysis of the problem areas, and I like the concepts of
trying to solve not only probe ordering, but also the problem of
when to turn off resources that will not be needed.  But at the
moment, I don't have a suggestion of a way to implement a solution.
