This pretty straight forward format if you look into /proc/pid/maps and others.
Parsing is trivial - just one sscanf().

If we are looking for abandoned pages in particular proces it is enough to
mark page idle and look at access bit in this process.

If page is shared and got foreign access -- it is not abandoned.
And some information could be retrieved right from pagemap: file/anon and
exclusive-map bits.

Your patch adds yet another per-task proc file which requires special tool.

My just extends existing interface and useful without any tools: just echo and cat.
And yet, special tool could get precise per-page information in binary form
along with other useful bits from /proc/pid/pagemap.
