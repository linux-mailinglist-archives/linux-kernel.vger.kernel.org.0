Well userspace process doing munmap(), mremap(), fork() and things like
that are a bug from the i915 kernel and userspace contract point of view.

But things like migration or reclaim are not cover under that contract
and for those the expectation is that CPU access to the same virtual address
should allow to get what was last written to it either by the GPU or the
CPU.

So let's only consider the case where GPU wants to write to the memory
(the read only case is obviously right and not need any notifier in
fact) and like above the only thing we care about is reclaim or migration
(for instance because of some numa compaction) as the rest is cover by
i915 userspace contract.

So in the write case we do GUPfast(write=true) which will be "safe" from
any concurrent CPU page table update ie if GUPfast get a reference for
the page then any racing CPU page table update will not be able to migrate
or reclaim the page and thus the virtual address to page association will
be preserve.

This is only true because of GUPfast(), now if GUPfast() fails it will
fallback to the slow GUP case which make the same thing safe by taking
the page table lock.

Because of the reference on the page the i915 driver can forego the mmu
notifier end callback. The thing here is that taking a page reference
is pointless if we have better synchronization and tracking of mmu
notifier. Hence converting to hmm mirror allows to avoid taking a ref
on the page while still keeping the same functionality as of today.

GPU driver have complex usage pattern the tlb shootdown is implicit
once the GEM object associated with the uptr is invalidated it means
next time userspace submit command against that GEM object it will
have to re-validate it which means re-program the GPU page table to
point to the proper address (and re-call GUP).

So the whole GPU page table update is all hidden behind GEM function
like i915_gem_object_unbind() (or ttm invalidate for amd/radeon).

Technicaly those GPU do not support page faulting but because of the
way GPU works you know that you have frequent checkpoint where you
can unbind things. This is what is happening here.

Also not all GPU engines can handle page fault, this is true of all
GPU with page fault AFAIK (AMD and NVidia so far). This is why
uptr is a limited form of SVM (share virtual memory) that can be
use on all GPUs engine including the dma engine. When using the
full SVM power (like hmm mirror with nouveau) this is only use in
GPU engine that supports page fault (but updating the page table
still require locking and waiting on acknowledge).

Cheers,
Jérôme
