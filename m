I am an idiot. I missed that the check "d_state != desc_committed"
will return -EINVAL also when desc_miss or desc_reserved.

I was too concentrated by the fact that desc->info.seq was checked
first even though it might contain garbage.

Also it did not help me much the note about blk_lpos. I did not
see how it was related to this code.

To sum up. The original code worked fine. But I would prefer my variant
that has more lines but it is somehow cleaner.

Best Regards,
