I might be wrong but I suspect a closer review would reveal that the use
will be inconsistent or dubious so following the existing users is not
the best approach.

Even if the destination node is memoryless then any migration would fail
because there is no memory. Anyway I still do not see how using online
node would break anything.

Even if that is the case it would be preferable because the current
situation is just not sustainable wrt maintenance cost. It is just too
simple to break the existing logic as this particular report outlines.
