Hisilicon HIP07 and HIP08 are compliant with ARM SBSA and have only one 
inner shareable domain in the whole system.

What will happen if a system has multiple inner shareable domains? Will 
Linux still work on such system? Can we declare that Linux only supports 
one single inner shareable domain?

Actually HIP08 L3 Cache will complain on any non-shareable cache entry, 
for the data coherence cannot be guarenteed for such configuration. This 
also implies VPENDING table will be allocated and snooped in L3 cache.
