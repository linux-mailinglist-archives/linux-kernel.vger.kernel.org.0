Correct.

The primary reason is that Stephen indicated in previous discussions 
that if the hardware exists, it should be indicated in DT, regardless if 
the driver uses it.  In the 7180 and 8150 case, the hardware exists, so 
these should not be optional.

The secondary reason is I found that the schema was broken anyways.  In 
the way it was written, if you implemented sleep, you could not skip 
xo_ao, however there is a dts that did exactly that.

The third reason was that I couldn't find a way to write valid yaml to 
preserve the original meaning.  when you have an "items" as a subnode of 
"oneOf", you no longer have control over the minItems/maxItems, so all 3 
became required anyways.  I find it disappointing that the "version" of 
Yaml used for DT bindings is not documented, so after several hours of 
trial and error, I just gave up since I found this to work (failed cases 
just gave me an error with no indication of what was wrong, not even a 
line number).

Is there an example somewhere?  The only thing I found was 
example-schema.yaml which seemed to suggest this way.

I'm fixing up the example so that it no longer fails checks.  See the 
above comment.
