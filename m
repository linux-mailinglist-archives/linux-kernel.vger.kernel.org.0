SiFive's UART has a software controller clock divider that produces the
final baud rate clock.  Whenever the clock that drives the UART is
changed this divider must be updated accordingly, and given that these
two events are controlled by software they cannot be done atomically.
During the period between updating the UART's driving clock and internal
divider the UART will transmit a different baud rate than what the user
has configured, which will probably result in a corrupted transmission
stream.

The SiFive UART has a FIFO, but due to an issue with the programming
interface there is no way to directly determine when the UART has
finished transmitting.  We're essentially restricted to dead reckoning
in order to figure that out: we can use the FIFO's TX busy register to
figure out when the last frame has begun transmission and just delay for
a long enough that the last frame is guaranteed to get out.

As far as the actual implementation goes: I've modified the existing
existing clock notifier function to drain both the FIFO and the shift
register in on PRE_RATE_CHANGE.  As far as I know there is no hardware
flow control in this UART, so there's no good way to ask the other end
to stop transmission while we can't receive (inserting software flow
control messages seems like a bad idea here).

I have not tested this, as I don't have any hardware.  I'm also not even
remotely familiar with the serial subsystem, so I don't know if there's a
better way of going about this.  I'm specifically worried about a udelay() that
could be quite long.  Maybe some sort of "delay for short times, sleep for long
times" approach would be better?

I don't know if this manifests in practice on existing hardware when running
real workloads, but I'd be willing to bet that it would be possible to trigger
the bug on purpose as by my calculations there's about a 10k cycle window in
which the clock can't change.  IIRC there's a lot of instability when changing
the clock frequency on the HiFive Unleashed so I doubt people are going to
stumble across the issue regularly in practice.
