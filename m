I don't get it. If make it as your words, the built module will be
blkzone.ko.
The module is named pstore/blk, however it built out blkzone.ko. I think
it's
confusing.

Sure. I will do it.

Wow! I marvel at kernel-doc. Your link has helped me a lot.

I will optimize all my comment and document later.

All the recorders such as dmesg, pmsg, console and ftrace have been
locked on
pstore and upper layers. So, a recorder will not write in parallel and
different
recorders operate privately zone. They don't have any influence on each
other.

The only parallel case I think is that recorder writes while dirty-flush
thread is
working. And the dirty-flusher will flush the whole zone rather than
part of it, so,
it is OK to call in parallel.

Based on these reasons, I don't think locking should be needed.

OK. I will add some comments on entry function blkz_recovery()。
