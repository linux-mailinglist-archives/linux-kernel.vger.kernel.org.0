YES!!!  ;-)

Snapshot mem_begin before entering the loop.  For the mean value to
be solid, you need at least 20-30 samples, which might mean upping the
default for kfree_loops.  Have an "unsigned long long" to accumulate the
sum, which should avoid any possibility of overflow for current systems
and for all systems for kfree_loops less than PAGE_SIZE.  At which point,
forget the "%" stuff and just sum up the si_mem_available() on each pass
through the loop.

Do the division on exit from the loop, preferably checking for divide
by zero.

Straightforward, fast, reasonably reliable, and easy to defend.
