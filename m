I was working on a patchset to solve read-write lock deadlock
detection problem (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/5/16/93).

One of the mistakes in that work is that I considered the following
case as deadlock:

  T1            T2
  --            --

  down_read1    down_write2

  down_write2   down_read1

So I was trying to understand what really went wrong and find the
problem is that if I understand correctly the current rwsem design
isn't showing real fairness but priority in favor of write locks, and
thus one of the bad effects is that read locks can be starved if write
locks keep coming.

Luckily, I noticed you are revamping rwsem and seem to have thought
about it already. I am not crystal sure what is your work's
ramification on the above case, so hope that you can shed some light
and perhaps share your thoughts on this.

Thanks,
Yuyang
