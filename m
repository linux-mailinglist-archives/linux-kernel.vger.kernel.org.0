My brain wires must have been crossed when I wrote that. Indeed, I mean
register pressure.

I'm referring to the examples provided in Documentation/core-api/atomic_ops.rst,
e.g.:

"For another example, consider the following code::

        tmp_a = a;
        do_something_with(tmp_a);
        do_something_else_with(tmp_a);

 If the compiler can prove that do_something_with() does not store to the
 variable a, then the compiler is within its rights to manufacture an
 additional load as follows::

        tmp_a = a;
        do_something_with(tmp_a);
        tmp_a = a;
        do_something_else_with(tmp_a);"

So if instead of "a" we have num_online_cpus(), the compiler would be
within its right to re-fetch the number of online cpus between the two
calls, which seems unexpected.

C11 states:

"Atomic operations specifying memory_order_relaxed are  relaxed  only  with  respect
to memory ordering.  Implementations must still guarantee that any given atomic access
to a particular atomic object be indivisible with respect to all other atomic accesses
to that object."

So I am concerned that num_online_cpus() as proposed in this patch
try to access __num_online_cpus non-atomically, and without using
READ_ONCE().

Similarly, the update-side should use WRITE_ONCE(). Protecting with a mutex
does not provide mutual exclusion against concurrent readers of that variable.

Again based on Documentation/core-api/atomic_ops.rst:

"For a final example, consider the following code, assuming that the
 variable a is set at boot time before the second CPU is brought online
 and never changed later, so that memory barriers are not needed::

        if (a)
                b = 9;
        else
                b = 42;

 The compiler is within its rights to manufacture an additional store
 by transforming the above code into the following::

        b = 42;
        if (a)
                b = 9;

 This could come as a fatal surprise to other code running concurrently
 that expected b to never have the value 42 if a was zero.  To prevent
 the compiler from doing this, write something like::

        if (a)
                WRITE_ONCE(b, 9);
        else
                WRITE_ONCE(b, 42);"

If the compiler decides to manufacture additional stores when updating
the __num_online_cpus cached value, then loads could observe this
intermediate value because they fetch it without holding any mutex.

Mathieu
