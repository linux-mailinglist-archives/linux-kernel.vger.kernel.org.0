The patch

   regulator: slg51000: use devm_gpiod_get_optional() in probe

has been applied to the regulator tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regulator.git for-5.4

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: slg51000: use devm_gpiod_get_optional() in probe

The CS GPIO line is clearly optional GPIO (and marked as such in the
binding document) and we should handle it accordingly. The current code
treats all errors as meaning that there is no GPIO defined, which is
wrong, as it does not handle deferrals raised by the underlying code
properly, nor does it recognize non-existing GPIO from any other
initialization error.

As far as I can see the only reason the driver, unlike all others,
is using OF-specific devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node() so that it can
assign a custom label to the selected GPIO line. Given that noone else
needs that, it should not be doing that either.

Let's switch to using more appropriate devm_gpiod_get_optional().
