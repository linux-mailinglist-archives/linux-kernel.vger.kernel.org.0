From: Vlastimil Babka <vbabka@suse.cz>

Mike Kravetz reports that "hugetlb allocations could stall for minutes or hours
when should_compact_retry() would return true more often then it should.
Specifically, this was in the case where compact_result was COMPACT_DEFERRED
and COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED and no progress was being made."

The problem is that the compaction_withdrawn() test in should_compact_retry()
includes compaction outcomes that are only possible on low compaction priority,
and results in a retry without increasing the priority. This may result in
furter reclaim, and more incomplete compaction attempts.

With this patch, compaction priority is raised when possible, or
should_compact_retry() returns false.

The COMPACT_SKIPPED result doesn't really fit together with the other outcomes
in compaction_withdrawn(), as that's a result caused by insufficient order-0
pages, not due to low compaction priority. With this patch, it is moved to
a new compaction_needs_reclaim() function, and for that outcome we keep the
current logic of retrying if it looks like reclaim will be able to help.
