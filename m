Now I understand. Thanks for the details!
As a result of testing, in the situation where vhci supports SG,
but stub does not, or vice versa, usbip works normally. Moreover,
because there is no protocol modification, there is no problem in
communication between server and client even if the one has a kernel
without SG support.

In the case of vhci supports SG and stub doesn't, because vhci sends
only the total length of the buffer to stub as it did before the
patch applied, stub only needs to allocate the required length of
buffers regardless of whether vhci supports SG or not.

If stub needs to send data buffer to vhci because of IN pipe, stub
also sends only total length of buffer as metadata and then send real
data as vhci does. Then vhci receive data from stub and store it to
the corresponding buffer of SG list entry.

In the case of stub that supports SG, if SG buffer is requested by
vhci, buffer is allocated by sgl_alloc(). However, stub that does
not support SG allocates buffer using only kmalloc(). Therefore, if
vhci supports SG and stub doesn't, stub has to allocate buffer with
kmalloc() as much as the total length of SG buffer which is quite
huge when vhci sends SG request, so it has big overhead in buffer
allocation.

And for the case of stub supports SG and vhci doesn't, since the
USB storage driver checks that vhci doesn't support SG and sends
the request to stub by splitting the SG list into multiple URBs,
stub allocates a buffer with kmalloc() as it did before this patch.

Therefore, everything works normally in a mismatch situation.
I will send the v3 soon.
