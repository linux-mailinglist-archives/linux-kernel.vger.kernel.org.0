There=E2=80=99s security certified, and then there=E2=80=99s what I =
personally consider secure.

The second category is code that I know is widely audited by lots of =
people,
and gets quickly updated when there is a problem. I like U-boot, and I =
think
its a great solution for industry, it=E2=80=99s just not the only =

What I see though is we=E2=80=99re duplicating code and work between =
bootloaders
and kernel, for example the SPI-NOR code, and if it was all linux, it =
would be
one driver model to learn/remember/track, and one place to fix things.

U-boot is great because you can boot other !linux things (like FreeBSD),
however if I was purpose building a linux cluster, I would want to be =
running
linux as early as possible so I can use linux scripting in =
bash/go/python and
talk to the queue/workload manager over a native high performance =
network
instead of the extremely limited =E2=80=98hush=E2=80=99 shell and having =
to discover which
user image to boot with something old and slow like dhcp/tftp/etc.=
