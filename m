The only recursion issue that I've seen discussed is breakpoints. And
that's outside of the tracer infrastructure. Basically, if someone added a
breakpoint for a kprobe on something that gets called in the int3 code
before kprobes is called we have (let's say rcu_nmi_enter()):


 rcu_nmi_enter();
  <int3>
     do_int3() {
        rcu_nmi_enter();
          <int3>
             do_int3();
                [..]

Where would a "in_tracer" flag help here? Perhaps a "in_breakpoint" could?
