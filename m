Short-cutting an idle cpu search reduces latency. There would be a mapping between the latency_nice values -20..-1 and 
the short cut. In that view 0 is the default and performs the full domain search as before and -20 presumably skips the 
entire search. Positive values then presumably indicate a trade-off in preference of throughput. I've not thought any 
about it till now, but maybe indicates that spending extra time (versus less) finding this task the perfect home to just 
sit and crank on throughput would be worth it.
