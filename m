This is the oom path and it should better not use any sleeping locks in
the first place.

And I repeat that no such reporting is going to write to files. This is
an OOM path afterall.

Yes, this is what I've had in mind.

Or simply provide a hook with the oom_control to be called to report
without replacing the whole oom killer behavior. That is not necessary.
