I spent much of time to address all your comments.
All are addressed and tested. except the above one(address offset calculati=
on)
I didn't see any issue with the address calculation.
for (i =3D 0; i < min_t(unsigned int, 4, naddrs); i++) {
	nfc_op->addrs |=3D instr->ctx.addr.addrs[i] <<
			 (8 * i);
}
If you go through the nand_base.c, there nand_fill_column_cycles() API, fil=
ls the first two or one address cycle
Based on bus width and page size.
That means, addrs[0]/[1] will be updated here.
And the page is updated to the next offsets.
In the similar way we have to extract the offsets in driver.
So the first four address bytes are stored using the above for() loop and i=
f the
Address cycles are more than 4, then store the remaining offsets as well.

I just compared the offsets that are updated in driver with the offsets(pag=
e and column) that the frame work(nand_base.c) is sending, and the offsets =
are same.
I have also checked these offsets with older driver(not exec_op() implement=
ed) and both are matching.

So I didn't see any issue with this addrs calculation.
As per the statement mentioned by you, this driver consumes addr[0], addr[1=
], addr[2], addr[3] and
If more address cycles needed, then addr[4] and addr[5]. This is correct.

Please let me know, what exactly I am missing.

Thank you for your inputs and sorry for the delay, as I am on leave for som=
e days.

Naga Sureshkumar Relli
