Sorry for the confusion.

Below is my understanding, if not correct or proper, just let me know :-)

According to current comment in __split_huge_pmd(), we check pmd_page with
page for migration case. While actually, this check also helps in the
following two cases when page already split-ed:

   * page just split-ed in place
   * page split-ed and moved to non-PMD aligned address

In both cases, pmd_page() is pointing to the PTE level page table. That's why
we don't split one already split-ed THP page.

If current code really intend to cover these two cases, sorry for my poor
understanding.

Hmm... Use HPAGE_PMD_SIZE here wants to emphasize we want the address to be
PMD aligned. If just use page_size() here, may confuse the audience?
