To me, this sounds like a reasonable good plan. Although, we need a
formal maintainer rather than just a company name.

If you or anybody at Axis can send a patch for MAINTAINERS, that would
serve as commitment that I would be happy with.

Additionally, of course, the sooner we can get things moving on
converting usdhi6rol0 into using the tmio family driver, the better.
