Then I'm afraid that until there is a corner case identified and a
description of the impact it's

Broadly speaking it was driven by cases whereby kswapd either a) fell
asleep prematurely and there were many stalls in direct reclaim before
kswapd recovered, b) stalls in direct reclaim immediately after kswapd went
to sleep or c) kswapd reclaimed for lower zones and went to sleep while
parallel tasks were direct reclaiming in higher zones or higher orders.
