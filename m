No, it's optional. If some/all protocols need dedicated channel for whatever
reasons(like DVFS/Perf for polling based transfers), they can specify.
Absence of dedicated channel infers all protocols share the channel(s).

Good.

IMO, we have to deal this in transport specific init. I am thinking of
chan_setup in context of this patch. Does that make sense ?

This caught my attention, why do we need these clocks phandle list and
clock names above ? Ideally just need scmi_clk phandle and the index to
refer and names need to be provided by the firmware.
