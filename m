I think you are correct here.  In looking at the code paths, all should
be good and safe.

But, if you use your patch, then you have to call kfree, and you can not
call kobject_put(), otherwise kfree_const() will be called twice on the
same pointer, right?  So you will have to audit the kernel and change
everything again :)

Or, maybe this patch would prevent that:


diff --git a/lib/kobject.c b/lib/kobject.c

But that feels like a huge hack to me.  I think, to be safe, we should
keep the existing lifetime rules, as it mirrors what happens with
'struct device', and that is what people _should_ be using, not "raw"
kobjects if at all possible.

Yeah, I know filesystems don't do that, my fault, I never thought a
filesystem would care about sysfs all those years ago :)

thanks,
