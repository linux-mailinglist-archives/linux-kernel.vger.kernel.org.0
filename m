My point is that enclaves have different properties than shared objects.

Normal LSM behavior with regard to executing files is to label files with
e.g. FILE__EXECUTE.  Because an enclave must be built to the exact
specifications of .sigstruct, requring FILE__EXECUTE on the .sigstruct is
effectively the same as requiring FILE__EXECUTE on the enclave itself.

Addressing your scenario of loading an executable page in EPC, doing so
would require one of the following:

  - Ability to install a .sigstruct with FILE__EXECUTE

  - PROCESS__EXECMEM

  - FILE__EXECMOD and SGX2 support

There is no FILE__EXECMEM check, only PROCESS__EXECMEM and FILE__EXECMOD.
I assume you're referring to the latter?

I don't see a fundamental difference between having RWX in an enclave and
RWX in normal memory, either way the process can execute arbitrary code,
i.e. PROCESS__EXECMEM is appropriate.  Yes, an enclave will #UD on certain
instructions, but that's easily sidestepped by having a trampoline in the
host (marked RX) and piping arbitrary code into the enclave.  Or using
EEXIT to do a bit of ROP.

Pulling permissions from source pages means userspace needs to fully map
the in normal memory, including marking pages executable.  That exposes
the loader to having executable pages in its address space that it has no
intention of executing (outside of the enclave).  And for Graphene, it
means having to actively avoid PROCESS__EXECMEM, e.g. by using a dummy
backing file to build the enclave instead of anon memory.

Because for the purposes of LSM checks, .sigstruct is the enclave's
backing file, and mapping a previously writable enclave page as exectuable
is roughly equivalent to mapping a CoW'd page as exectuable.
