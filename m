As I noted before, actually filling in the video data is only a small part
of the measured CPU load. To put in in more precise numbers:

From my limited understanding, there are 8000 interrupts per second
regardless of the bandwidth (or maybe less for very low bandwidth
configurations?).
Just queuing requests without any content (so skipping the buffer handling
and 'encode()' in uvc_video_complete()) results in ~17% CPU load.

If I fill in the data for a video stream with ~1.8MB per frame and 30 fps
(and empty requests for the rest) then the CPU load goes up to ~19.5%.
This number remains the same for different bandwidths (and therefore
different request sizes and a different zero-length request percentage).

With my patches the CPU load changes as expected. The 2.5% to fill the data
remains and the rest goes down with less interrupts.

I am hoping that more batching will help here a bit. But either way the
overhead of queuing zero-length request is significant.

My problem is this:
Let's assume a (for simplicity) that I have a video stream that fills
almost the full available bandwidth. And two reduce the bandwidth, two
interrupts will be requested for each video frame.

- When the first frame arrives, the whole frame is queued.
- When the first half of the frame is transmitted the first interrupt
  arrives.
- The second frame has not yet arrived so half a frame worth of 0-length
  requests are queued.
- When the second half of the frame is transmitted the second interrupt
  arrives.
- The second frame has still not yet arrived so another half a frame worth
  of 0-length requests are queued.
- Immediately afterwards the second frame arrives from userspace. At this
  point, almost one frame worth of 0-length requests are queued so the
  second frame will have an extra latency of almost one frame.

With my patch this does not happen and the transmission of the second
starts immediately.

I'm unsure about the extra API Thinh was talking about. Right now in my
tests I'm queuing normal requests with 'request->length = 0' when no video
data is available. This has the problems described above.

The question is, can we do better than that? What could be done in the
driver if it knows that 0-length requests must be transmitted because no
new data is available?

Ok.
