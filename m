Why do you claim that a straight transition into the closed state is
wrong?

I don't see any such mention in blkif.h, which also doesn't contain
any guidelines regarding closing state transitions, so unless
otherwise stated somewhere else transitions into closed can happen
from any state IMO.

> But, we could have a flag that the backend driver sets to say that it supports transparent re-bind that gates this code. Would that make you feel more comfortable?

Having an option to leave state untouched when unbinding would be fine
for me, otherwise state should be set to closed when unbinding. I
don't think there's anything else that needs to be done in this
regard, the cleanup should be exactly the same the only difference
being the setting of all the active backends to closed state.

> If you want unbind to actually do a proper unplug then that's extra work and not really something I want to tackle (and re-bind would still need to be toolstack initiated as something would have to re-create the xenstore area).

Why do you say the xenstore area would need to be recreated?

Setting state to closed shouldn't cause any cleanup of the xenstore
area, as that should already happen for example when using pvgrub
since in that case grub itself disconnects and already causes a
transition to closed and a re-attachment afterwards by the guest
kernel.

Thanks, Roger.
