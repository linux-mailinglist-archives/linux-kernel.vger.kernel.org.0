I am so happy to use Sysvinit on my systems again. Depending on entropy 
for just booting a machine is broken¹.

Of course regenerating SSH keys on boot, probably due to cloud-init 
replacing the old key after a VM has been cloned from template, may 
still be a challenge to handle well². I'd probably replace SSH keys in 
the background and restart the service then, but this may lead to 
spurious man in the middle warnings.


[1] Debian Buster release notes: 5.1.4. Daemons fail to start or system 
appears to hang during boot

https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#entropy-starvation

[2] Openssh taking minutes to become available, booting takes half an 
hour ... because your server waits for a few bytes of randomness
