I think current perf already did this.
All metric groups are weak group. Kernel (validate_group()) tells perf 
tool whether a metric group fit to available counters.
If yes, the metric group will be scheduled as a group.
If no, perf tool will not using a group and re-try. The code is as below.

  try_again:
  		if (create_perf_stat_counter(counter, &stat_config, &target) < 0) {

  			/* Weak group failed. Reset the group. */
  			if ((errno == EINVAL || errno == EBADF) &&
  			    counter->leader != counter &&
  			    counter->weak_group) {
  				counter = perf_evlist__reset_weak_group(evsel_list, counter);
  				goto try_again;
  			}


This patch set is to workaroud the false-positives from the kernel.
Kernel only validate the group itself. It assumes that all counters are 
available. So, when any counter is permanently occupied by others, e.g. 
watchdog, the validate_group() may return false-positives.

? not just for chosen
> ones..?

For now, I think we only need to workaround the Page_Walks_Utilization 
metric group. Because it has 5 events, and one of the events is cycles.
The cycles has to be scheduled on fixed counter 2. But it's already 
occupied by watchdog.
The false-positives of validate_group() will trigger the issue (metric 
group never be scheduled.).

For other metric groups, even they have cycles, the issue should not be 
triggered.
For example, if they have 4 or less events, the cycles can be scheduled 
to GP counter instead.
If they have 6 or more events, the weak group will be reject anyway.
Perf tool will open it as non-group (standalone metrics).

I think we only need to apply the constraint for the 
Page_Walks_Utilization metric group for now.
