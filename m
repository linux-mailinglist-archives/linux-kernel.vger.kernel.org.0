I fully agree that there is requirement to expose device connections
as Suzuki's patches provided. As commented in the original patch, it
removes the need for users to have knowledge of hardware specifics or
access to device tree source.

For the trace datapath a simple link is sufficient to express this
information. The nature of the data and connection is known - it is
the trace data running from source to sink. The linked components are
guaranteed to be registered coresight devices

However, the requirement for the CTI is different.

CTI is not limited to connecting to other coresight devices. Any
device can be wired into a CTI trigger signal. These devices may or
may not have drivers  / entries in the device tree.
For each connection a client needs to know the signals connected to
the cti, the signal directions, the signal prupose if possible, and
the device connected.
For this reason we dynamically fill out a connections infomation
sub-dir in sysfs containing _name, _trigin_sig, _trigout_sig,
_trigin_type, _trigout_type - described in the patch [1].

This information is sufficient and necessary to enable a user to
program a CTI in most cases.

As an example look at the Juno dtsi in [2].
CTI 0 is connected to ETR, ETF, STM and TPIU - all coresight devices.
CTI 1 is connected to REF_CLK, system profiler and watchdog - no
coresight devices at all.
CTI 2 is connected to ETF, and two ELA devices - so 1 coresight device
and 2 not coresight devices.

So my view is that for the case where CTI is connected to another
CoreSight device the sysfs link could be used in addition to the
information described above.

Regards.

Mike
