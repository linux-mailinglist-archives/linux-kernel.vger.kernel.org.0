You are right. PageHuge() is true only for HugeTLB pages unlike PageTransHuge()
which is true for both HugeTLB and THP pages. So the current code does migrate
the THP out in order to allocate a gigantic HugeTLB. While here just wondering
should not we exclude THP as well unless it supports ARCH_HAS_THP_MIGRATION.
