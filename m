Forgot mentioning about the spatial locality.  Yes, it is workload dependant,
but still pervasive in many case.  Also, many core mechanisms in kernel such as
read-ahead or LRU are already using some similar assumptions.

If it is so problematic, you could set the maximum number of regions to the
number of pages in the system so that each region monitors each page.
