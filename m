You could handle this by sending IPI-to-self and dealing with it in the inte=
rrupt handler. Or even wake a high-priority kthread or workqueue. irq_work m=
ay help. Relying on task_work or the non_atomic stuff seems silly - you can=E2=

Here=E2=80=99s where dealing with one that came from kernel code is just nas=
ty, right?

I would argue that, if IF=3D0, killing the machine is reasonable.  If IF=3D1=
, we should be okay.  Actually making this work sanely is gross, and arguabl=
y the goal should be minimizing grossness.

Perhaps, if we came from kernel mode, we should IPI-to-self and use a specia=
l vector that is idtentry, not apicinterrupt.  Or maybe even do this for ent=
ries from usermode just to keep everything consistent.

Easy :)

It would be really, really nice if NMI was masked in MCE context.
