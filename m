Not sure I understand what you suggest here, sorry. I have no problem
with the enums.

The important point I am trying to make here, is that we should split
the clock provider data and the mmc variant data, simply because those
doesn't really belong to each each other.

Something like this:

struct sdhci_arasan_zynqmp_data {
         bool tap_delays;
         u8 tapdly[MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS400 + 1][2]; /* [0] for input
delay, [1] for output delay */
         + other variant specific data one may want to put here
}

These are just regular mmc OF data that are parsed as any other
property of the mmc device.

The "const struct zynqmp_eemi_ops *eemi_ops; should then be moved into
a clock provider specific struct, which is assigned when calling
sdhci_arasan_register_sdclk. I understand that all the clock data is
folded into struct sdhci_arasan_data today, but I think that should be
moved into a "sub-struct" for the clock specifics.

Moreover, when registering the clock, we should convert from using
devm_clk_register() into devm_clk_hw_register() as the first one is
now deprecated.

The ->set_tap_delay() callback is for ZyncMp pointing to
sdhci_arasan_zynqmp_set_tap_delay(). This function calls the
clk_set_phase() API.

What does ->set_tap_delay() do for the latest version?

Okay, then let's target this via my mmc tree this time.

Kind regards
