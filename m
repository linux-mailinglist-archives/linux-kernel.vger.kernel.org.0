This is why it is hard to argue about pure abstractions. The primary idea mentioned so far for how these latencies are 
reduced is by short cutting the brute-force search for something idle. If you don't find an idle cpu because you didn't 
spend the time to look, then you pre-empted a task, possibly with a large nice warm cache footprint that was cranking 
away on throughput. It is ultimately going to be the usual latency vs throughput trade off. If latency reduction were 
"free" we wouldn't need a per task attribute. We would just do the reduction for all tasks, everywhere, all the time.

Hopefully, the above helps. It was my original plan to introduce this with a data laden RFC on the topic, but I felt the 
need to respond to Parth immediately. I'm not currently pushing any particular change.
