Intel has the 'fun' case of an LLC spanning nodes :-), although Linux
pretends this isn't so and truncates the LLC topology information to be
the node again -- see arch/x86/kernel/smpboot.c:match_llc().

And of course, in the Core2 era we had the Core2Quad chips which was a
dual-die solution and therefore also had multiple LLCs, and I think the
Xeon variant of that would allow the multiple LLC per node situation
too, although this is of course ancient hardware nobody really cares
about anymore.

That sounds like perfectly fine/expected behaviour to me.

So IIRC the initial patch(es) had the idea to allow for 1 extra task
imbalance to get 1-1 pairs on the same node, instead of across nodes. I
don't immediately see that in these later patches.

Would that be something to go back to? Would that not side-step much of
the issues under discussion here?
