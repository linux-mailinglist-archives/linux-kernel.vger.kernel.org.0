(For some context, and for what it's worth, my opinion is that device-managed
deallocation is the best thing since sliced bread.)

Typical devm use-case is:
1) user allocates a resource
2) user registers release_func+resource_context to devm

So typically, only 2 pointers (which is no issue when the alignment
requirement is 8 bytes). By nature, these are "small" allocations.

devm_kmalloc does not follow this pattern, it is a kind of optimization.
1) user does not allocate the resource (RAM)...
2) ...because the devm framework "merges" the user's memory request with
its own memory request for storing metadata -- as a memory allocator does
when it stores metadata for the request "in front of" the memory block.
(this is the reason why devm_kmalloc_release() is a noop)


(The following is just random thinking out loud)

If "fixing" the kmalloc strict alignment requirement on arm64 is too
hard, maybe it would be possible to shave some of the devm memory
waste by working with (chained) arrays of devm nodes, instead
of a straight-up linked list. (Akin to a C++ vector) Removal would
be expensive, but that's supposed to be a rare operation, right?

Regards.
