As a general rule, we pinned IRQs on little core because of such
responsiveness  difference. I don't have numbers in mind as the tests
were run at the beg of b.L system.. few years ago
Then, if you look at some idle states definitions in DT, you will see
that exit latency of cluster down state of big core of hikey960 is
2900us vs 1600us for little

Making big cores the default CPUs for all RT tasks is not a minor
change and IMO locality should stay the default behavior when there is
no uclamp constraint
