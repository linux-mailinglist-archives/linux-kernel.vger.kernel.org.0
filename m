My pleasure, and thank you for the feedback!  I'm sorry it's
taken me a while to respond to it.

Thanks.  Fixed for the next version.

OK, thank you.  I'm not actually using DT, I'm using ACPI tables.

For DT, would this cause the device to get bound to the driver on
startup?

I tried adding a reg property with the value set to the device's
I2C address with device tree compatible properties, coupled with
the DT "compatible" string property, but that was insufficient to
bind the device to the driver.  At the moment, I'm using the ACPI
mechanism for achieving this.

So all I've done for this is add the "reg" property to the device
tree ti,ds90ub948.txt documentation file, in the Example section.

Is this what you were expecting?

For the other point, that the DT node should be a child of its I2C
controller, I've made the devices descendants of the I2C controller
in ACPI, but one of them is not a direct child.

The ti949 is a child of its I2C controller node, but the ti948
is a child of the ti949 node in the ACPI table.  I did this to
ensure that linux was aware of the dependency of the devices, so
that they would be brought up in the correct order and suspended
and resumed in the correct order.

Thank you!  I've switched to using that, and it is less code.  :)

I'm not clear on the implications of this from the driver code.
Does it need any code changes to the driver to support these
endpoints?  How are they used?

If it's just a documentation thing, I can easily do it, but
otherwise, I can't test Device Tree because we're using ACPI.
