ocxl is arguably maybe an exception here, given that it is a PPC64 bus
only from what I can tell.  Odd that they are using this option, but I
think it might be just to keep CONFIG_TEST to work properly.

The thing is, why do you need this?  What makes that platform somehow
unique for your driver?  Focus on that and you should be able to detect
it specifically, not just the processor type (which usually is on a wide
range of hardware types.)
