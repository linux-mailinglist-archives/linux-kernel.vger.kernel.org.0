The problem is that there is no general idiom where we could say with
confidence that a data race is safe across the whole kernel. Here it
might not matter, but somewhere else it might matter a lot.

If you think that it turns out the entire file may be littered with
'data_race()', and you do not want to use annotations, you can
blacklist the file. I already had to do this for other files in mm/,
because concurrent flag modification/checking is pervasive and a lot
of them seem 'benign'. We decided to revisit those files later.

Feel free to add 'KCSAN_SANITIZE_memory.o := n' or whatever other
files you think are full of these to mm/Makefile.

The only problem I see with that is that it's not obvious what is
concurrently modified and what isn't. The annotations would have
helped document what is happening.

Thanks,
