Madhuparna, could you please send the patch using this as well, to prevent
confusion? You can see how just sending one patch and not the user of it
creates avoidable confusion. Thanks.

Thanks Paul for taking a look. If I remember the dependent patch uses
rcu_dereference() but I don't remember all the details at the top of my head.

thanks,

 - Joel
