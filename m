Well, yes that's an issue since we decided that all new drivers should
implement ->exec_op() instead of the legacy hooks. But that would be an
issue even if we were merging the driver in staging.

I agree on that point: we should merge this driver directly in the NAND
framework after it's been reworked to implement ->exec_op() instead of
the legacy hooks.
