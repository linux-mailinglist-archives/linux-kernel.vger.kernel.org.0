Yes, there may be performance overhead.(I thought it's minimal) However,
I can change the name of dir form "read_to_remove_%d" to
"read_to_remove_%s(dev_name)_%d" to fix that.

I think it's a bug device creation succeed when the debugfs directory
exist. Of course delay block device creation can fix the problem, but I
haven't come up with a good solution. And by renaming the dir, there is
no need to delay cration.
