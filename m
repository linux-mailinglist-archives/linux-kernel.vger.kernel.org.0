Logically, whether dtb_mem is a "unsigned long" or phys_addr_t doesn't
matter unless the kernel is compiled under LLP64.
As far as the existing kexec code, either generic or arm64-specific,
is concerned, however, "unsigned long is widely used as a physical address
(For example, see kexec_buf definition) over the code.

(Oops, reboot_code_buffer_phys is a phys_addr_t :)

So as long as my kexec_file (and associated kdump) patch comes first
before Pavel's, I'd like to keep using "unsigned long".
Then, you can change "unsigned long" to phys_addr_t in your patch
for whatever reason it is.

Please note that, if you want to do that, it would be better to modify
not only kimage_arch but also all the occurrences of "unsigned long"
to phys_addr_t for maintaining the integrity.

In addition, in my kexec_file kdump code, I still believe that
"#ifdef CONFIG_KEXEC_FILE" should stay before the definition of
kimage_arch as kimage_arch is of no use for normal kexec code.

Again,
"#ifdef" statement may be moved forward once additional fields be
added later by Pavel's patch, say, "[PATCH v8 15/25] arm64: kexec:
move relocation function setup" for any reason.

I believe that this way gives us a logical and consistent view of
history of changes.
Make sense?

Thanks,
