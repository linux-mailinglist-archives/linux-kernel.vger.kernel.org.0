>> I did not anwer clearly last time. It was just an example. The result of that "if" depends on NAND flash device timing mode and NAND flash controller clock. Minumum value of clk is 20MHz (50ns). So it may be a case for Asynchronous Mode 1 if

Ok. I added a description to last patch version v4. Let me know if it
