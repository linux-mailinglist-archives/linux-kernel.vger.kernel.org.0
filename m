Right now, the effective protection of any given cgroup is capped by
its own explicit memory.low setting, regardless of what the parent
says. The reasons for this are mostly historical and ease of
implementation: to make delegation of memory.low safe, effective
protection is the min() of all memory.low up the tree.

Unfortunately, this limitation makes it impossible to protect an
entire subtree from another without forcing the user to make explicit
protection allocations all the way to the leaf cgroups - something
that is highly undesirable in real life scenarios.

Consider memory in a data center host. At the cgroup top level, we
have a distinction between system management software and the actual
workload the system is executing. Both branches are further subdivided
into individual services, job components etc.

We want to protect the workload as a whole from the system management
software, but that doesn't mean we want to protect and prioritize
individual workload wrt each other. Their memory demand can vary over
time, and we'd want the VM to simply cache the hottest data within the
workload subtree. Yet, the current memory.low limitations force us to
allocate a fixed amount of protection to each workload component in
order to get protection from system management software in
general. This results in very inefficient resource distribution.

To enable such use cases, this patch adds the concept of recursive
protection to the memory.low setting, while retaining the abilty to
assign fixed protection in leaf groups as well.

That means that if protection is explicitly allocated among siblings,
those configured weights are being followed during page reclaim just
like they are now.

However, if the memory.low set at a higher level is not fully claimed
by the children in that subtree, the "floating" remainder is applied
to each cgroup in the tree in proportion to its size. Since reclaim
pressure is applied in proportion to size as well, each child in that
tree gets the same boost, and the effect is neutral among siblings -
with respect to each other, they behave as if no memory control was
enabled at all, and the VM simply balances the memory demands
optimally within the subtree. But collectively those cgroups enjoy a
boost over the cgroups in neighboring trees.

This allows us to recursively protect one subtree (workload) from
another (system management), but let subgroups compete freely among
each other without having to assign fixed shares to each leaf.

The floating protection composes naturally with fixed
protection. Consider the following example tree:

		A            A: low = 2G
               / \          A1: low = 1G
              A1 A2         A2: low = 0G

As outside pressure is applied to this tree, A1 will enjoy a fixed
protection from A2 of 1G, but the remaining, unclaimed 1G from A is
split evenly among A1 and A2. Assuming equal memory demand in both,
memory usage will converge on A1 using 1.5G and A2 using 0.5G.

There is a slight risk of regressing theoretical setups where the
top-level cgroups don't know about the true budgeting and set bogusly
high "bypass" values that are meaningfully allocated down the
tree. Such setups would rely on unclaimed protection to be discarded,
and distributing it would change the intended behavior. Be safe and
hide the new behavior behind a mount option, 'memory_recursiveprot'.
