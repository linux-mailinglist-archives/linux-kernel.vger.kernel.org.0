department we discovered an abandoned sum of 15 million dollars. In an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along

claim. I want you stand as next of kin to the deceased. I agree 40% of
this money will be for you as foreign partner. I will not fail to
bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you
should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements
have been made for the transfer.
