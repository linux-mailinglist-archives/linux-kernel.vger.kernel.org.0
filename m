Thanks your information.
We focus on the smartphone, so it doesn't enable
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE, Is it invalid for our usecase?
And It looks like something is different, because we only need last
stack of page, so it can decrease memory overhead.
I will try to enable debug_pagealloc(with your patch) and KASAN, then we
see the result.

Thanks.
