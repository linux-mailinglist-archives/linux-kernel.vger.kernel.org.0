ACK, the systemd commit which introduced that code also does:

This 10min wait thing is really broken... it's basically "forever".

ACK.

Moreover, and as a result of all that, distributions are now officially
*duct-taping* the problem:

    https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#entropy-starvation

    5.1.4. Daemons fail to start or system appears to hang during boot
  
    Due to systemd needing entropy during boot and the kernel treating
    such calls as blocking when available entropy is low, the system
    may hang for minutes to hours until the randomness subsystem is
    sufficiently initialized (random: crng init done).

"the system may hang for minuts to hours"...

ACK, I'll send an RFC v2, returning buflen, and so on..

/me will enjoy the popcorn from all the to-be-reported WARN_ON()s
on distribution mailing lists ;-)
