Hi Alexei,
There are various people use the preempt/irq disable tracepoints for last 2
years at Google and ARM. There's also a BPF tool (in BCC) that uses those for
tracing critical sections. Also Daniel Bristot's entire Preempt-IRQ formal
verification stuff depends on it.

If we go by that line of reasoning, then function tracing also should be
removed from the kernel.

I am glad Thomas and Peter are working on it and looking forward to seeing
the patches,

thanks,

 - Joel
