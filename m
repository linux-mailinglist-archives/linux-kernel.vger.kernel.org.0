I think for short term, yes, it is better to revert the commits
that make things more broken.

for-linus-v5.5-rc5 branch contains three commits that exactly do
this i.e. the reverts that Stefan sent and revert to Jerry's earlier
commit.

After that is out of the table it is easier to analyze how the code
should be actually refactored. Like, I have no idea when I get
local HW that can reproduce this and Jerry still seems to have the
same issue. It'd be nice make the exactly right changes instead of
reverts but situation is what it is.

Please check the branch and ACK/NAK if I can add tested-by's (and
other tags).
