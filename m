I probably wouldn't change the mount options to be different from what
was initially specified. How about just disable copy_file_range
internally for that superblock, and then pr_notice a message that says
that copy_file_range is being autodisabled. If they mount with '-o
nocopyfrom' that will make the warning go away.

Yep, I think this looks like a _much_ simpler approach to the problem.
