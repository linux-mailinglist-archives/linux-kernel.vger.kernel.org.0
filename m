Frankly how well that behaves would depend a lot on the workload.
Can regress just as well.

For the 1st version I'd prefer something that is the least disruptive,
and that IMHO means we only trigger reclaim at all in the same configuration
as now - when we can't satisfy the lowest order allocation.

Anything else would be a huge amount of testing with all kind of
workloads.
