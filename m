Alright, I didn't suffer such case before...

I don't know, too few clues to find the root cause. I guess maybe:
- random data caused by emmc/ufs firmware bugs
- bit-flip or memory overflow
- f2fs bugs

So, for the solution, I suggest to detect such inconsistency, and tag in
somewhere to just get rid of selecting the corrupted section.

BTW, do you try fsck on that image? what's the result?

Thanks,
