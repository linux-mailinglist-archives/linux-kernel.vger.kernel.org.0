To be precise, nothing is scheduled while creating a hibernation image, 
but once the image has been created, threads that are not frozen can be 
scheduled again and there are kernel threads which aren't frozen.

So the question is whether or not any of the kernel threads which are 
not frozen can do anything potentially unsafe if the bdi wq is not 
freezable and I don't quite see what that might be.
