I see, to me it seems like LGM got a nice set of register cleanups!
so I'm all for dropping the syscon compatible

if there was only the LGM SoC then I would say: drop regmap

however, last year a driver for the GRX350/GRX550 SoCs was proposed: [0]
this was never updated but it seems to use the same "framework" as the
LGM driver
with this in mind I am for keeping regmap support because.
I think it will be easier to add support for old SoCs like
GRX350/GRX550 (but also VRX200), because the PLL sub-driver (I am
assuming that it is similar on all SoCs) or some other helpers can be
re-used across various SoCs instead of "duplicating" code (where one
variant would use regmap and the other readl/writel).

so when my x86 kernel maintainer enables CONFIG_INTEL_LGM_CGU_CLK then
OF_EARLY_FLATTREE is enabled as well.
does this hurt any existing x86 platform? if not: why can't we enable
it for x86 unconditionally?

thank you for evaluating them. let's continue the discussion above
whether regmap should be used - after that we decide (if needed) which
regmap implementation to use
