No objection to the idea, but a question...

In patched kernel, does slabinfo (or similar) show the list reparented
slab caches?  A pile of zombie kmem_caches is certainly better than a
pile of zombie mem_cgroup.  But it still seems like it'll might cause
degradation - does cache_reap() walk an ever growing set of zombie
caches?

We've found it useful to add a slabinfo_full file which includes zombie
kmem_cache with their memcg_name.  This can help hunt down zombies.
