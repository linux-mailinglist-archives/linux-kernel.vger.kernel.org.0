Thank you for explanation. I agree with apply no constraints if MCLK is
set to 0, and suitable constraints if MCLK is set to other values like
as wm8731 and wm8741 drivers.

I'll change my patch set and send.


Would you tell me one more thing. I don't understand who sets MCLK to 0.
Is it needed original machine driver instead of audio-graph-card?

On my test environment (audio-graph-card + Rockchip I2S + ES8316), it
seems audio-graph-card has never called set_sysclk() with freq = 0 after
stop play/capture sound. So my env will go to bad scenario as I 
described in this patch.

Best Regards,
Katsuhiro Suzuki
