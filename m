Subject: [PATCH v3 0/4] Genericize DW MIPI DSI bridge and add i.MX 6 driver

Having a generic Synopsis DesignWare MIPI-DSI host controller bridge
driver is a very good idea, however the current implementation has
hardcoded quite a lot of the register layouts used by the two supported
SoC vendors, STM and Rockchip, which use IP cores v1.30 and v1.31.

This makes it hard to support other SoC vendors like the FSL/NXP i.MX 6
which use older v1.01 cores or future versions because, based on history,
layout changes should also be expected in new DSI versions / SoCs.

This patch series converts the bridge and platform drivers to access
registers via generic regmap APIs and allows each platform driver to
configure its register layout via struct reg_fields, then adds support
for the host controller found on i.MX 6.

I only have i.MX hardware with MIPI-DSI panel and relevant documentation
available for testing so I'll really appreciate it if someone could test
the series on Rockchip and STM... eyeballing register fields could only
get me so far, so sorry in advance for any breakage!

Many thanks to Boris Brezillon <boris.brezillon@collabora.com> for
suggesting the regmap solution and to Liu Ying <Ying.Liu@freescale.com>
for doing the initial i.MX platform driver implementation.

This series applies on top of latest linux-next tree, next-20191118.

v2 -> v3:
  * Added const declarations to dw-mipi-dsi.c structs (Emil)
  * Fixed Reviewed-by tags and cc'd some more relevant ML (Emil)

v1 -> v2:
  * Moved register definitions & regmap initialization into bridge
  module. Platform drivers get the regmap via plat_data after calling
  the bridge probe (Emil).
