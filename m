Here's the full patch, can you include it in your series?
As madvised THP allocations might be affected (hopefully just by stalling less,
not by failing too much), adding relevant people to CC - testing the scenarios
you care about is appreciated. Thanks.

Subject: [PATCH] mm, compaction: raise compaction priority after it withdrawns

Mike Kravetz reports that "hugetlb allocations could stall for minutes or hours
when should_compact_retry() would return true more often then it should.
Specifically, this was in the case where compact_result was COMPACT_DEFERRED
and COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED and no progress was being made."

The problem is that the compaction_withdrawn() test in should_compact_retry()
includes compaction outcomes that are only possible on low compaction priority,
and results in a retry without increasing the priority. This may result in
furter reclaim, and more incomplete compaction attempts.

With this patch, compaction priority is raised when possible, or
should_compact_retry() returns false.

The COMPACT_SKIPPED result doesn't really fit together with the other outcomes
in compaction_withdrawn(), as that's a result caused by insufficient order-0
pages, not due to low compaction priority. With this patch, it is moved to
a new compaction_needs_reclaim() function, and for that outcome we keep the
current logic of retrying if it looks like reclaim will be able to help.
