Right, I was just giving it as an example. Your suggestion sounds much better and
wouldn't interfere with other layers, plus we already use skb->hash in bond_xmit_hash()
and skb_set_owner_w() sets l4_hash if txhash is present which is perfect.

One thing - how do we deal with sk_rethink_txhash() ? I guess we'll need some way to
signal that the user specified the txhash and it is not to be recomputed ?
That can also be used to avoid the connect txhash set as well if SO_TXHASH was set prior
to the connect. It's quite late here, I'll look into it more tomorrow. :)

Thanks,
 Nik
