Of course it is, and sure it has a reserve+commit internally. I'm sure I
posted an implenentation of something like this at some point.

It is lockless (wait-free in fact, which is stronger) and supports
multi-readers. I'm sure I posted something like that before, and ISTR
John has something like that around somewhere too.

The only thing I'm omitting is doing vscnprintf() twice, first to
determine the length, and then into the reservation. Partly because I
think that is silly and 256 chars should be plenty for everyone, partly
because that avoids having vscnprintf() inside the cpu_lock() and partly
because it is simpler to not do that.

Have an irq_work to wake up a kthread that will print to shit consoles.
Seriously.. the trylock and flush stuff is horrific crap. You guys been
piling on the hack for years now, surely you're tired of that gunk?

(and if you _reallllly_ care, build a flush function that 'works'
mostly and waits for the kthread of choice to finish printing to the
'imporant' shit console).

The kernel thread in charge of printing doesn't care.

The kernel thread doesn't care. If you care about independent consoles,
have a kernel thread per console. That way a fast console can print fast
while a slow console will print slow and everybody is happy.

Right, I'm saying that since you need it anyway, lift it up one layer.
It makes everything simpler. More simpler is more better.

So panic is a non issue for the lockless console.

It only matters if you care to get something out of the crap consoles.
So print everything to the lockless buffer and lockless consoles, then
try and force as much as you can out of the crap consoles.

If you die, tought luck, at least the lockless consoles and kdump image
have the whole message.

Why? I'm running with that thing on, I've never seen a deadlock ever
because of it. In fact, i've gotten output that is plain impossible with
the current junk.

The cpu-lock is inside the all-backtrace spinlock, not outside. And as I
said yesterday, only the lockless console has any wait-loops while
holding the cpu-lock. It _will_ make progress.

I hope the above helps. Also note that Linus' memory buffer is a
lockless console.
