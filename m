I dunno.  I'd rather see correctness over performance.  Certainly we'd
only need to do the extra bounce buffer for input buffers at least.

Although I don't love the idea, is this something where we want to
introduce a config option (either runtime or through KConfig),
something like:

CONFIG_DWC2_FAST_AND_LOOSE - Avoid bounce buffers and thus run faster
at the risk of a bad USB device being able to clobber some of your
memory.  Only do this if you really care about speed and have some
trust in the USB devices connected to your system.
