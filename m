If you are getting 10 MPPS with an OUT per packet, I=E2=80=99ll buy you a
whole case of beer.

I=E2=80=99m suggesting that, on virtio-legacy, you benchmark the performanc=
e
hit of using a syscall to ring the doorbell.  Right now, you're doing
an OUT instruction that traps to the hypervisor, probably gets
emulated, and goes out to whatever host-side driver is running.  The
cost of doing that is going to be quite high, especially on older
machines.  I'm guessing that adding a syscall to the mix won't make
much difference.
