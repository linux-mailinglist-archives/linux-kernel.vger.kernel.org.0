I only see a minor issue: They're (deliberately) lengthy. Using many of
them diverts attention of the reader. Therefore, my proposal attempted
to reduce their frequency. The only issue I see here is readability.

Not quite. You're getting a clock reference in probe and then repeatedly
access the frequency elswhere. I am suggesting that you get the clock
frequency during probe and never save the clock reference to a struct.

I compared this code to marvell_nand.c and noticed a subtle difference.
Both snippets read 6 address bytes and consume them in a driver-specific
way. Now which address bytes are consumed differs.

marvell_nand.c consumes instr->ctx.addr.addrs at indices offset,
offset+1, offset+2, offset+3, offset+4, offset+5. pl353_nand.c consumes
instr->ctx.addr.addrs at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, offset, offset+4, offset+5.
(In my previous mail, I didn't notice that it was also consuming the
offset index.)

I would have expected this behaviour to be consistent between different
drivers. If I assume marvell_nand.c to do the right thing and
pl353_nand.c to be wrong (which is not necessarily a correct
assumption), then the code woule likely becom:

	addrs = &instr->ctx.addr.addrs[offset];
	for (i = 0; i < min_t(unsigned int, 4, naddrs); i++) {
		nfc_op->addrs |= addrs[i] << (8 * i);
		              // ^^^^^
	}

Hope this helps.

Helmut
