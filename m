We are awaiting Mike's comment on the approach, as his CTI support also
needs something similar.

Sure, will do. As such, the perf testing should not be affected by that
series. It is just a helper to demonstrate the connections. But yes, it
will definitely help you to choose an ETF for a cluster, if you had multiple
ETFs on the system. Otherwise, you should be OK.

Please be aware that the power management support is missing on ACPI platform.
So you must make sure, by other means, that the debug domain is powered up.
