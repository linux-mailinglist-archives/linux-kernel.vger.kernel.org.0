Hello, Joel.

First of all thank you for improving it. I also noticed a high pressure
on RCU-machinery during performing some vmalloc tests when kfree_rcu()
flood occurred. Therefore i got rid of using kfree_rcu() there.

I have just a small question related to workloads and performance evaluation.
Are you aware of any specific workloads which benefit from it for example
mobile area, etc? I am asking because i think about backporting of it and
reuse it on our kernel. 

Thank you!
