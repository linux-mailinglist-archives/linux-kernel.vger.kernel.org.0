TBH, I'm unsure whether that's worth it. The architecture is completely
built around having the private interrupts in blocks of 32, and you can
only get something wrong if you misdecode the number of interrupts from
the registers.

I don't see what this brings us at this point. The architecture doesn't
seem to go in the direction of adding more SGIs, so we're pretty safe on
that front...
