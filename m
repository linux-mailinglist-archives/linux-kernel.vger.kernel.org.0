Well, the whole hardware is not very linux like!

Not ideal, but you could rely on ARP and ND. Any conversation should
start with a broadcast/multicast ARP or ND. The bridge should add an
FDB based on what it just learned, and traffic should flow. And when
the interface is not part of a bridge, you don't care about unknown
unicast.

O.K, the software bridge can handle that. It is not the best use for
hardware, but will work.

Yes, that is the first step. Some switches go further. Link local L2
frames are always passed to the CPU. All ARP and ND packets are
passed, IGMP, etc. Once you have the first step working, you start
thinking about the next step. That is blocking some of this traffic
hitting the CPU. IGMP snooping is one way. You need to continue
receiving the IGMP frames, but not the multicast traffic. But they use
the same MAC address. So the switch needs to look deeper into the
packet.

Learning is needed. But maybe not its own Tx queue. It depends on the
QoS architecture. Ideally you want QoS to work on CPU frames, so they
get put into the correct egress queue for there QoS level.

With DSA this is simpler, since you have a physical interface
connected to the CPU, so you can use that interface number in all your
tables. But with a pure switchdev driver, each port effectively
becomes two ports, one to the front panel and one to the CPU port. And
your tables need to differentiate this.
