[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 5 of them as possibly being bugs in the lockdep subsystem.  I've listed
these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first the reports
most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 5 bugs, 3 were seen in mainline in the last week.

Of these 5 bugs, 1 was bisected to a commit from the following person:

	Bart Van Assche <bvanassche@acm.org>

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the lockdep subsystem, please let me
know, and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:
