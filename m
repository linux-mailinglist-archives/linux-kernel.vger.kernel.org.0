This seems more complicated than needed.  How about we just remove all the m=
agic and make putreg on the base registers never change the selector.

As far as I can tell, the only downside is that, on a non-FSGSBASE kernel, s=
etting only the base if the selector already has a nonzero value won=E2=80=99=
t work, but I would be quite surprised if this breaks anything.=
