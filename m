I think we need to untangle things a bit here.

The arm64 PCS makes no guarantee about the position of the frame record with
respect to stack allocations, so relying on this is fragile at best. This is
partly why the ftrace-with-regs work currently relies on
-fpatchable-function-entry, since that allows the very beginning of the
function to be intercepted which I don't think is necessarily the case with
-pg/_mcount.

For the snippet above, foo is a leaf function and does not have a frame record
placed on the stack. If we instead look at something like:

__attribute__((noinline)) int baz(int x)
{
	return x;
}

__attribute__((noinline)) int bar(int x)
{
	int a[32];
	return baz(x * a[0]);
}

int foo(int x)
{
	return bar(x);
}

then the first instruction of bar() allocates stack space and pushes
the frame record at the same time:

	stp	x29, x30, [sp, -144]!

This can be read as "subtract 144 bytes (32*4 + 16) from the stack pointer,
write the frame record there and then update the stack pointer to point at the
bottom of the newly allocated stack", which means that the array 'a[32]' sits
directly /above/ the frame record on the stack. However, this is just what my
GCC happened to do today. When we looked at this back in 2015, there were other
cases we ended up having to identify with heuristics based on what had been
observed under various compilers:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-December/393721.html

This was deemed to be far too fragile, so we didn't merge it in the end.

If this is to work reliably, then we need support from the tools. This was
raised when we first merged support for ftrace, but I'm not sure it went
anywhere:

https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2016-01/msg00035.html

So, I completely agree with Steve that we shouldn't be littering the core code
with #ifdef CONFIG_ARM64, but we probably do need something in the arch backend
if we're going to do this properly, and that in turn is likely to need a very
different algorithm from the one currently in use.
