This is often true, but not always the case. For example, with DSU big
and little cores can be placed within the same cluster.

This is not correct.

Linux requires that all cores it uses are within the same Inner
Shareable domain, regardless of whether they are in distinct clusters.
Linux does not support systems where cores are in distinct Inner
Shareable domains.

This is the intended use of the architecture. Per ARM DDI 0487E.a page
B2-144:

| This architecture assumes that all PEs that use the same operating
| system or hypervisor are in the same Inner Shareable shareability
| shareability

... where a PE is a "Processing Element", which you can think of as a
single core.

As above, this works because all the relevant cores are within the same
Inner Shareable domain.

The __flush_icache_range/__flush_cache_user_range assembly function does
both the D-cache maintenance with DC CVAU, then the I-cache maintenance
with IC IVAU, so I think you have misread it.

Thanks,
Mark.
