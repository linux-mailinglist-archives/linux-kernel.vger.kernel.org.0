Integrating Intel LGM support into reset-lantiq boils down to re-writing 
reset-lantiq driver as intel-reset driver and adding Lantiq variant 
support. Why because reset-lantiq driver is not according to hardware 
design[1].

I see the final best solution is to integrate Lantiq variant driver to 
intel-reset driver.[1]
I hope you guys are ok with it. Please let me know your view.
