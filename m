The interval would have to be a sysctl - like the one for sleeping uninterruptibly.
(Although that one is a pain for some kernel threads. I'd like to be able to
mark some uninterruptible sleeps as 'long term' and also not affecting the load
average.)

I remember (a long time ago) adding code to an ethernet driver to limit it
to 90% of the bandwidth to allow other systems to transmit (10M HDX).
Someone said ' we can't do that, people expect 100%', a week later he
asked me how to enable it because the AMD Lance could never transmit
if receiving back to back packets  (eg in promiscuous mode).
Benchmarks are a PITA....
