I think we need to check how the downshift feature works on other PHYs
and whether it is enabled there.

Looking at the Marvell 88e151x PHYs, they have the feature, but do not
enable it by default.  If firmware has enabled the feature, phylib will
incorrectly resolve the link speed based on just the advertisements.

I think the safest way in the case of both PHYs to ascertain the real
link speed is to read the Specific Status register - register 17 in
both cases.  The top two bits indicate the negotiated speed resolution
and bit 13 indicates the duplex.  Bit 11 indicates whether the
resolution is valid.  This register layout seems to apply to both
88e151x and AR8035.

The register also contains the pause mode resolution in terms of
receive or transmit pause enabled, but this is not useful to phylib
as that is not what phylib wants to know.  However, it probably makes
sense for phylib to resolve the pause mode negotiation itself rather
than having that logic in the MAC drivers.
