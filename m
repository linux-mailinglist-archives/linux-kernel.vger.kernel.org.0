That's fine, but we also must be mindful of users who have used 
MADV_HUGEPAGE over the past four years based on its hard-coded behavior 
that would now regress as a result.

I confirm that on every platform I have tested that the access latency to 
local pages of the native page size has been less than hugepages on any 
remote node.  I think it's generally accepted that NUMA-ness is more 
important than huge-ness in terms of access latency and this is not the 
reason why the revert is being proposed.  Certainly if the argument is to 
be made that the default behavior should be what is in the best interest 
of Linux users in totality, preferring remote hugepages over local pages 
of the native page size would not be anywhere close.  I agree with 
Aneesh's commit message 100%.

Thus far, I haven't seen anybody engage in discussion on how to address 
the issue other than proposed reverts that readily acknowledge they cause 
other users to regress.  If all nodes are fragmented, the swap storms that 
are currently reported for the local node would be made worse by the 
revert -- if remote hugepages cannot be faulted quickly then it's only 
compounded the problem.

The hugepage aware mempolicy idea is one way that could describe what 
should be done for these allocations, we could also perhaps consider 
heuristics that consider the memory pressure of the local node: just as 
I've never seen a platform where remote hugepages have better access 
latency than local pages, I've never seen a platform where remote 
hugepages aren't a win over remote pages.  This, however, is more delicate 
on 4 socket and 8 socket platforms but I think a general rule that a 
hugepage is better, if readily allocatable, than a page on the same node.  
(I've seen cross socket latency for hugepages match the latency for pages, 
so not always a win: better to leave the hugepage available remotely for 
something running on that node.)  If the local node has a workingset that 
reaches its capacity, then it makes sense to fault a remote hugepage 
instead because otherwise we are thrashing the local node.

That's not a compaction problem, though, it's a reclaim problem.  If 
compaction fails and it's because we can't allocate target pages, it's 
under memory pressure and it's uncertain if reclaim will help: it may fail 
after expensive swap, the reclaimed pages could be grabbed by somebody 
else and we loop, or the compaction freeing scanner can't find it.  Worst 
case is we thrash the local node in a swap storm.  So the argument I've 
made when the removal of __GFP_THISNODE was first proposed is that local 
hugepage allocation should be the preference including direct compaction 
for users of MADV_HUGEPAGE (or thp enabled=always) but reclaim should 
never be done locally.  I'd very much like to engage with anybody who 
would be willing to discuss fixes that work for everybody rather than only 
propose reverts and leave others to deal with new performance regressions.
