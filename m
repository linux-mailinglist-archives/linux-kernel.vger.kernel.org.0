Subject: [PATCH 3/3] perf vendor events power9: Fix commas so PMU event files are valid JSON
Date:   Tue, 12 Nov 2019 16:03:41 +0000
Message-Id: <20191112160342.26470-3-james.clark@arm.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.23.0
In-Reply-To: <20191112160342.26470-1-james.clark@arm.com>

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

No functional change.

Remove extra commas in the power9 JSON files so that the files
can be parsed and validated by other utilities such as Python
that fail to parse invalid JSON.
