I mean incorrect status info.

I think so.

The dev pointer at current_image_show() should points to RSU device, but 
it seems point to driver_private if I use .group = rsU_groups. As a 
result I can't get the priv pointer properly at current_image_show().

If I use devm_device_add_groups(), the dev pointer does point to RSU device,

I agree we shouldn't call devm_device_add_groups() directly.

RSU status is only updated after power on or reboot, RSU driver get 
status info at probe() & save them to the private pointer priv via 
platform_set_drvdata().

static struct platform_driver stratix10_rsu_driver = {
         .probe = stratix10_rsu_probe,
         .remove = stratix10_rsu_remove,
         .driver = {
                 .name = "stratix10-rsu",
                 .groups = rsu_groups,
         },
};

The problem is that I don't have a way to properly retrieve the priv 
pointer at xx_show() functions. Global variable is a work around, but I 
don't think it is a good approach.

Any suggestion?

Richard
