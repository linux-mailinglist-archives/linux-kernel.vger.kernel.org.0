I did some more debugging on this using ftrace, here is an annotated
log that shows what I think is happening on a failed resume. Note that
hub_port_connect_change() is the function that the patch modified to
call usb_get_device_descriptor() in some circumstances.

This first call to hub_port_connect_change() is for a different device,
not the failing one. There are multiple other calls to that function in
the trace, but they are not for the device in question:
     kworker/1:6-19987 [001]  7803.175058: funcgraph_entry:                      |  hub_port_connect_change() {
     kworker/1:6-19987 [001]  7803.175069: funcgraph_entry:      ! 11911.151 us  |    usb_get_device_descriptor();
     kworker/2:5-20675 [002]  7803.179333: funcgraph_entry:                      |  usb_probe_interface() {

Starting here is a worker thread that is trying to setup the bluetooth
adapter after the resume:
   kworker/u17:1-3175  [002]  7803.179457: funcgraph_entry:                      |  hci_power_on() {
   kworker/u17:1-3175  [002]  7803.179458: funcgraph_entry:                      |    hci_dev_do_open() {
   kworker/u17:1-3175  [002]  7803.179468: funcgraph_entry:                      |      btusb_setup_intel() {
     kworker/2:5-20675 [002]  7803.179480: funcgraph_exit:       ! 147.596 us    |  }

And here is a worker thread that is handling the connect change on the USB
port with the bluetooth device. This happens while the btusb_setup_intel()
function called by the other thread above is still running:
     kworker/3:1-16790 [003]  7803.181323: funcgraph_entry:                      |  hub_port_connect_change() {
     kworker/3:1-16790 [003]  7803.181330: funcgraph_entry:                      |    usb_get_device_descriptor() {
     kworker/0:2-19962 [000]  7803.184885: funcgraph_entry:        6.016 us      |  hub_port_connect_change();
     kworker/0:2-19962 [000]  7803.187208: funcgraph_entry:        5.462 us      |  hub_port_connect_change();
     kworker/1:6-19987 [001]  7803.187835: funcgraph_exit:       ! 12776.810 us  |  }
     kworker/1:6-19987 [001]  7803.187846: funcgraph_entry:      ! 767445.344 us |  hub_port_connect_change();

By this point the failure has happened ("Bluetooth: hci0: Reading Intel
version information failed (-110)") , and it looks like somebody
queues another work to try setting up the bluetooth adapter again:
       hciconfig-21074 [000]  7803.193549: funcgraph_entry:                      |  hci_dev_open() {
     kworker/1:6-19987 [001]  7803.955315: funcgraph_entry:      ! 144039.307 us |  hub_port_connect_change();
   kworker/u17:1-3175  [003]  7805.203325: funcgraph_exit:       ! 2023855 us    |      }
   kworker/u17:1-3175  [003]  7805.211728: funcgraph_exit:       ! 2032269 us    |    }
   kworker/u17:1-3175  [003]  7805.211731: funcgraph_exit:       ! 2032273 us    |  }
       hciconfig-21074 [000]  7805.211760: funcgraph_entry:                      |    hci_dev_do_open() {
       hciconfig-21074 [000]  7805.211777: funcgraph_entry:      ! 3069605 us    |      btusb_setup_intel();

And here the usb_get_device_descriptor() call made by the USB worker thread
finally completes. It also fails ("kworker/3:1 timed out on ep0in len=0/18"):
     kworker/3:1-16790 [003]  7808.277224: funcgraph_exit:       ! 5095893 us    |    }
       hciconfig-21074 [001]  7808.283313: funcgraph_exit:       ! 3071554 us    |    }
       hciconfig-21074 [001]  7808.283315: funcgraph_exit:       ! 5089767 us    |  }

So if I'm understanding this correctly, there are two threads that are
trying to access the USB bluetooth device at the same time. I have no
idea if that is how it's supposed to work.

Thanks,
Paul
