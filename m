In the development of an optimal Interface System, we see considerations to=
 culture, became relevant, and a universalization of paradigm, finding the =
three letter paradigm to be too narrow.

Particulary the error margin of a culture, goes to the club, where it gets =
its outlet in sex.

The question becomes how much can one improve it? Or really what can one do=
 with the schizophrenia of psychiatry vs club, that itself states sex on th=
e city is ok.

It will never resolve.

If one analyses history, gods of the club kind, often were gay, until they =
found the holy grail, that for sexual purposes, reduced the mushromm god, t=
o minimal, so that it was not gay, in the club itself.

Making weekdays macho, and the weekend gardenly.Which is what many people s=
till believe, - The three-letter paradigm of most societies.

Which basically a good O.S. must escape. Or I.S. really Interface System, a=
s we deal really only with interfacing between software and hardware.

Because where I grew up this three-letter paradigm was so fixed, that basic=
ally a drunk O.S. like Microsoft just could happen.

I am trying the name Z-IS, for the moment, trying to escape this paradigm, =
as much as possible, giving the club to those who want, and really have not=
hing to do with it myself. I just want an optimal economy for myself, and m=
y society.

And so comes the question, what netcurrency should one support? The same co=
nsiderations goes to this ofcourse.

Libra seems to be GNU related. So even Facebook tries to do this in GNU spa=
ce.

Any thoughts on this? (sane please)
