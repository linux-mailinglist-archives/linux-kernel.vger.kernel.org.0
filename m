Not on x86; that wrapper is the fallback for architectures without
non-trivial user_access_begin/user_access_end

"unsafe" != "lacks access_ok", it's "done under user_access_begin".
And this series is just a part of much bigger pile.

FWIW, with the currently linearized part I see 26 users in arch/x86 and
108 - outside of arch/*.  With 43 of the latter supplied by the sodding
comedi_compat32.c, which needs to be rewritten anyway (or git rm'ed,
for that matter)...

We'll get there; the tricky part is the ones that come in pair with
something other than access_ok() in the first place (many of those
are KVM-related, but not all such are).

This part had been more about untangling uaccess_try stuff,,,
