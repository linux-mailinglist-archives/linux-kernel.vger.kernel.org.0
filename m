Yes, generally this might be purely informational or be a dynamically
debuggable
mechanism for end user as I mentioned in previous discussion
thread(https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/22/198).
Could I know if it is not suitable that we expose a file for
informational usage?


If everyone agreed above, about the definition of =E2=80=9Cunknown=E2=80=9D=
 and the condition
=E2=80=9Cdon=E2=80=99t know the orientation=E2=80=9D, what about adding add=
itional return value?
  1. For original =E2=80=9Cunknown=E2=80=9D, it is a generic unknown state =
which can
indicate no
      matter connector is disconnected, cannot specify which cc side
is configured(such as Ra-Ra),
      or even driver can not know the orientation.
  2. New additional value =E2=80=9Cunavailable=E2=80=9D, it can be used to
specifically explicate that
      driver can not know the orientation.
Take UCSI as example, it can use generic =E2=80=9Cunknown=E2=80=9D or =E2=
=80=9Cunavailable=E2=80=9D if
it wants.
But if it exposes =E2=80=9Cunavailable=E2=80=9D, then application in user s=
pace can
know that this attribute is not useful.



I summarize the proposal definition below:
 - unknown (generic unknown. driver don=E2=80=99t or can=E2=80=99t know the=
 polarity,
                      e.g. disconnected, both cc1 and cc2 are the same, )
 - normal (configured in cc1 side)
 - reversed (configured in cc2 side)
 - unavailable (not support the polarity detection)


Thanks in advance.
