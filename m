There's only a risk of data corruption if mmap_sem is held for reading. 
If it's held for writing then the pagetable contents should be stable.

Indeed pte_offset_map_lock() will take a non-atomic *pmd value in 
pte_lockptr() before taking the pte spinlock.

I believe the rule here is that if pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() 
finds the pmd 'stable' while holding the mmap_sem read-locked, then the 
pmd cannot change while we are continuously holding the mmap_sem.

Hence the followup pte_offset_map_lock() and other iterators can look at 
the value of the pmd without locking. (Individual pte entries still need 
the pte-lock, because they might be faulted-in in parallel.)

So the pmd use pattern in swapin_walk_pmd_entry() should be safe.

I'm not 100% sure though - so I've added a few more Cc:s ...

I've also cleaned up the pmd_read_atomic() some more to make it more 
readable - see the patch below.

Thanks,

	Ingo

Fix spelling, consistent parenthesis and grammar - and also clarify
the language where needed.
