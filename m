It isn't documented (as many things we still do are) and it's not a big
deal. But most people seem to be counting revisions starting from 0 it
seems. I went looking for previous version to link to in the patch cover
letter and was confused because I was missing a v1. :)

Anyway, I'm happy that Hridya landed this! It was fun helping her the
last couple of weeks on- and off-list. Thanks for getting this done! I
hope we'll see even more patches in the future. :)
