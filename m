Good point, and yes, you have told me this before.

Furthermore, in all of these cases, the process was supposed to be
running on CPU 0, which cannot be taken offline on any of the systems
under test.  Which is leading me to wonder if the workqueue CPU-online
notifier is sometimes moving more kthreads to the newly onlined CPU than
it is supposed to.  Tejun, could that be happening?
