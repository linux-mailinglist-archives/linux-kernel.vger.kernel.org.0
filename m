Subject: [PATCH 3/3] scsi: core: change function comments to kernel-doc style
Date:   Wed, 11 Sep 2019 17:37:35 -0300

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Despite of functions being documented they are not in the kernel-doc
specification, and could not be included in kernel documentation. Change
the style of functions comments to be compliant to the kernel-doc style.
