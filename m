I am additionally concerned about add_bootloader_randomness() because it 
is possible for it to sleep because of add_hwgenerator_randomness() as 
once it hits the entropy threshold. As-is it can not be used inside 
start_kernel() because the sleep would result in a kernel panic, and I 
suspect its use inside early_init_dt_scan_chosen() for the commit "fdt: 
add support for rng-seed" might also be problematic since it is 
effectively called underneath start_kernel() is it not?

If add_bootloader_randomness was rewritten to call 
add_device_randomness() always, and when trusted also called the 
functionality of the new credit_trusted_entropy_bits (no longer needing 
to be exported if so), then the function could be used in both 
start_kernel() and early_init_dt_scan_chosen().
