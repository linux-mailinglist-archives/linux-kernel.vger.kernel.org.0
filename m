We already more or less do this: we have mm_cpumask(), which is
particularly awful since it writes to a falsely-shared line for each
context switch.

For what it's worth, in some sense, your patch series is reinventing
the tracking that is already in cpu_tlbstate -- when we do a flush on
one mm and some cpu is running another mm, we don't do an IPI
shootdown -- instead we set flags so that it will be flushed the next
time it's used.  Maybe we could actually refactor this so we only have
one copy of this code that handles all the various deferred flush
variants.  Perhaps each tracked mm context could have a user
tlb_gen_id and a kernel tlb_gen_id.  I guess one thing that makes this
nasty is that we need to flush the kernel PCID for kernel *and* user
invalidations.  Sigh.
