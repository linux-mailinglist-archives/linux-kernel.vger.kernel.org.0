The idea comes from the upstream discussion between Linus and Andrea:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/10/30/560

A summary to the issue: there was a special path in handle_userfault()
in the past that we'll return a VM_FAULT_NOPAGE when we detected
non-fatal signals when waiting for userfault handling.  We did that by
reacquiring the mmap_sem before returning.  However that brings a risk
in that the vmas might have changed when we retake the mmap_sem and
even we could be holding an invalid vma structure.

This patch removes the risk path in handle_userfault() then we will be
sure that the callers of handle_mm_fault() will know that the VMAs
might have changed.  Meanwhile with previous patch we don't lose
responsiveness as well since the core mm code now can handle the
nonfatal userspace signals quickly even if we return VM_FAULT_RETRY.
