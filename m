So, the design is not making the assumption that a particular scheme 
will change often. It is just allowing the flexibility for addition of 
new schemes or enhancements if needed.

That is the exact reason for having pluggable backend, because we cannot 
determine now if there will be a need of new scheme in future or not.

That is the idea to keep the design flexible to be able to handle future 
additions with maximum reuse. Example, supporting new algorithms or a 
different handling of secure variable updates by different vendors.

Sorry, probably it wasn't clear. By addition of new variables, we meant 
that over time we might have to add new "volatile" variables that "fine 
tunes" secure boot state. This might impact the kernel if it needs to 
understand new variables to define its policies. However, this will not 
result in change of API, it will result in change of the version.

We are changing how we are exposing the version to the kernel. The 
version will be exposed as device-tree entry rather than a OPAL runtime 
service. We are not tied to the name "backend", we can switch to calling 
it as "scheme" unless there is a better name.
