Hi Mark,

Sorry if I was not clear enough.

This HW is messy. It is indeed one monolithic device which
provides several functions/sub-devices/components

I tried several approaches:

* Just 1 component: This was ugly because the part that is present only on 1
SoC variant, I needed to reconstruct the dai, widget, route and control
table which involved a fair amount of useless copies.

* A lot of devices (and components) with syscon: This ended up being even
  uglier, difficult to work with since it did not really reflected the
  actual HW.

The solution proposed here is just one device with 3 possible
components (groups):
* The CPU producers a associated path
* The HDMI control
* The Internal DAC control

The impact on ASoC is rather small, the driver reflect quite well what
the HW is and, with a sound-dai-cell=2, it fairly simple in DT as well.

Do you think there is something wrong with a linux device providing
several ASoC components ?
