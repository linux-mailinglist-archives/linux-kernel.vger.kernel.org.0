Yep, that's what I figured after having a closer look at the code.

To be honest, I had something less invasive in mind. Something closer
to what spidev provides (a driver that can expose I3C devices to
userspace when explicitly requested). I see now that the USB subsystem
does something similar to what's done here, but I'm wondering if it's
really worth it in the I3C case. As I said in my previous reply, I
expect i3cdev to be used when experimenting or when kernel-space driver
is not an option (licensing/security issues).
