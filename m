Yes, we considered that, but it looks like the event reads are not 
"batched" in any manner. So, the IPI overhead will be similar.

Thanks for clarifying, that makes sense. Though we need to be careful in 
ensuring the sysfs semantics work as expected.

That's a good point. We can optimize later if this turns out to be a 
problem in practice, if we end up using this approach.
