I read this patch, I read force_dma_encrypted(), I read the changelog
again, and I haven't the faintest clue what TTM could possibly be
doing with force_dma_encrypted().

You're saying that TTM needs to transparently change mappings to
relocate objects in memory between system memory and device memory.
Great, I don't see the problem.  Is the issue that you need to
allocate system memory that is addressable by the GPU and that, if the
GPU has insufficient PA bits, you need unencrypted memory?  If so,
this sounds like an excellent use for the DMA API.   Rather than
kludging directly knowledge of force_dma_encrypted() into the driver,
can't you at least add, if needed, a new helper specifically to
allocate memory that can be addressed by the device?  Like
dma_alloc_coherent()?  Or, if for some reason, dma_alloc_coherent()
doesn't do what you need or your driver isn't ready to use it, then
explain *why* and introduce a new function to solve your problem?

Keep in mind that, depending on just how MKTME ends up being supported
in Linux, it's entirely possible that it will be *backwards* from what
you expect -- high address bits will be needed to ask for
*unencrypted* memory.
