I suspect it got lost in the email thread. Care to send as a separate
RFC patch? We can put it to mm for a cycle or two to see how it behaves.
The patch seems quite simple and straightforward from a very quick
glance. It is a bit of a hack that it piggybacks on top of the shrinker
code which should ideally go away if this approach works but that is a
minor detail.
