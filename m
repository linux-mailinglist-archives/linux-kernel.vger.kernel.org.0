Yeah, sorry, more things came up such that it still hasn't been P yet ;)

Lorenzo and I did get as far as discussing it a bit more and writing up 
a ticket, so it's formally on our internal radar now, at least.

Yes, that's an undesirable issue, but in fact I think it's mostly 
indicative that involving drivers in something which is designed to 
happen at a level below drivers is still fundamentally wrong and doomed 
to be fragile at best.

Another thought that crosses my mind is that when pci_device_group() 
walks up to the point of ACS isolation and doesn't find an existing 
group, it can still infer that everything it walked past *should* be put 
in the same group it's then eventually going to return. Unfortunately I 
can't see an obvious way for it to act on that knowledge, though, since 
recursive iommu_probe_device() is unlikely to end well.

Indeed it's non-trivial, but it really does need cleaning up at some point.

Having just had yet another spark, does something like the untested 
super-hack below work at all? I doubt it's a viable direction to take in 
itself, but it could be food for thought if it at least proves the concept.

Robin.
