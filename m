Yeah, the changelog is not really helpful. Let me fix that.

As discussed on IRC, this might be too broad, but then I rather have the
actual C-entry points neither traceable nor probable in general and
relax this by calling functions which can be traced and probed.

My rationale for this decision was that enter_from_user_mode() is marked
notrace/noprobe as well, so I kept the protection scope the same as we
had in the ASM maze which is marked noprobe already.
