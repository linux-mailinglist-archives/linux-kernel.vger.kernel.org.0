Sorry, I didn't realize you were waiting on me,

I'm traveling currently, so this is more off the top of my head than
looking at the code/docs.  What I'm thinking is that we want to get
autorefresh enabled, which would be simple except that the bootloader
may have already enabled it for us.  Perhaps we have a state flag that
indicates if autorefresh is enabled, and if so, it skips the start
command (where the start command is normally in the code).  When we
boot up, we check the hardware and set the flag if its already enabled
(note I just realized the flag is per ping pong, so we need multiple
flags I guess).  If the flag is not enabled when we go to use the
start command, we issue the start, then set the flag.  The only catch
is I don't know recall the exact sequence of when we configure the
ping pong in the entire initialization sequence.  We may configure a
bunch of stuff, but not the ping pong, flush the config (which issues
a start) and then get stuck because we didn't set the autorefresh.
