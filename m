Perhaps, I'm biased in the same way Doug is, but reviewing RPMh
patches is especially difficult because exactly this kind of
documentation is missing. The relationship and inheritance between
TCS, DRV, RSC, and how many of each are inside of what is never really
spelled out. This makes it difficult to reason about what new patches
are doing and whether or not it works. Having the register layout and
documentation helps convey these relationships, and helps others to
ensure that the code is correctly doing what it's intended to do.
