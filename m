I laid this out in another mail sent based on timing so I would repeat
myself other than to say it's predictable across machines.

I would expect so too with the caveat that there can be more memory
channels within a node so positioning does matter but we can't take
everything into account without creating a convulated mess. Worse, we have
no decent method for estimating bandwidth as it depends on the reference
pattern and scheduler domains do not currently take memory channels into
account. Maybe they should but that's a whole different discussion that
we do not want to get into right now.

I think running tasks at least is the least bad metric. idle CPUs gets
caught up in corner cases with bindings and util_avg can be skewed by
outliers. Running tasks is a sensible starting point until there is a
concrete use case that shows it is unworkable. Lets see what you think of
the other untested patch I posted that takes the group weight and child
domain weight into account.
