OK, just be aware that there are also rules for syscon compatible
drivers, see for example: [0]
if Rob (dt-bindings maintainer) is happy with the documentation in
patch 1 then I'm fine with it as well.
for my own education I would appreciate if you could describe these
"other misc registers" with a few sentences (I assume that this can
also help Rob)

I see, thank you for the explanation
this won't work on VRX200 for example because the status register is
not always at (reset register - 0x4)

with reset-lantiq we have the following register information:
a) reset offset: first reg property
b) status offset: second reg property
c) reset bit: first #reset-cell
d) status bit: second #reset-cell

reset-intel-syscon derives half of this information from the two #reset-cells:
a) reset offset: first #reset-cell
b) status offset: reset offset - 0x4
c) reset bit: second #reset-cell
d) status bit: same as reset bit

I cannot make any suggestion (yet) how to handle VRX200 and LGM in one
driver because I don't know enough about LGM (yet).
on VRX200 my understanding is that we have 64 reset bits (2x 32bit
registers) and 64 status bits (also 2x 32bit registers). each reset
bit has a corresponding status bit but the numbering may be different
it's not clear to me how many resets LGM supports and how they are
organized. for example: I think it makes a difference if "there are 64
registers with each one reset bit" versus "there are two registers
with 32 bits each"
please share some details how it's organized internally, then I can
try to come up with a suggestion.

... after writing this I noticed that we are discussing the binding.
we definitely need to share a summary with Rob on patch #1 and check
with him if he sees any problems with the approach that we may come up
with
