I think it's atomic in the same way that atomic_read() is atomic (which is
typically defined using READ_ONCE()).

Agreed, but what we don't want is something like:

	Thread 1			Thread 2
					set_bit(...); // bit is now 1
	test_bit(...); // returns 1
	test_bit(...); // returns 0

which is what can happen due to this erratum. It's generally good practice
to use READ_ONCE() when reading something which can be updated concurrently
because:

	* It ensures that the value is (re-)loaded from memory

	* It prevents the compiler from performing harmful optimisations,
	  such as merging or tearing (although in this case I suspect
	  these are ok because we're dealing with a single bit)

	* On Alpha, it gives you a barrier so that dependency ordering
	  can be relied upon from the load

	* It keeps KCSAN happy

I think the current definition of test_bit() gives you the first two by
casting to volatile explicitly, but not the second two.

So I'm mainly curious as to the disconnect between my thinking and Linus's
"That's not going to happen" comment, given that it shouldn't have an
impact on architectures that don't need magic here.

Will
