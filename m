Subject: [PATCH 00/16 v3] function_graph: Rewrite to allow multiple users
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org



The background for this is explained in the V1 version found here:

 http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181122012708.491151844@goodmis.org

The TL;DR; is this:

 The function graph tracer required a rewrite, mainly because it
 can only allow one callback registered at a time. The main motivation
 for this change is to allow kretprobes to use the code of function
 graph tracer, which should allow all archs that have function graph
 tracing to also have kretprobes with no extra work.

Masami told me that one requirement was to allow the function entry
callback to store data on the shadow stack that can be retrieved by
the the function return callback. I added this, as well as a per-task
variable (used by one of the function graph users).

The two functions to allow the storing of data on the stack and
retrieval of it are:

 void *fgraph_reserve_data(int size_in_bytes)

    Allows the entry function to reserve up to 4 words of data on
    the shadow stack. On success, a pointer to the contents is returned.
    This may be only called once per entry function.

 void *fgraph_retrieve_data(void)

    Allows the return function to retrieve the reserved data that was
    allocated by the entry function.

Changes since v2:

  http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190520142001.270067280@goodmis.org

 As a request from Peter Zijlstra, I changed the direction of
 the stack from growing up, to growing down. It passes some smoke
 tests, but I will need to run a lot more tests on it. But I decide
 to post this series anyway.

 Also changed, was using BULID_BUG_ON() instead of the align tricks,
 And also used round_up() to remove another align trick.

 I found a bug it patch 4 that was fixed in patch 5, but I fixed
 it in patch 4 to keep it bisectable.

 Added a few more comments, and also added more boot up self tests to
 test more of the passing of data around.
