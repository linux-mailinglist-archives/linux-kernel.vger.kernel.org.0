Sorry to point this out so late, but your S-o-B should come last in the
chain per Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst. Judging by the
rest of that, I think you want something like:

Co-developed-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>
Signed-off-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com> [shadow rework]
Signed-off-by: Daniel Axtens <dja@axtens.net>

... leaving yourself as the Author in the headers.

Sorry to have made that more complicated!

There should be TLB maintenance between clearing the PTE and freeing the
page here.

Thanks,
Mark.
