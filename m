Can we not just move these clocks entirely from the glue layer to the 
core layer? That didn't seem to break when I tried it, although I'll 
admit my 'testing' was no more than booting and mounting a USB 3.0 flash 
drive, no suspend or anything fancy.

My own attempt to shut up these errors got sidetracked into c0c61471ef86 
("usb: dwc3: of-simple: Convert to bulk clk API"), then apparently 
stalled :)
