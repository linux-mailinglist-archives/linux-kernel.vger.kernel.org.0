Yes, this is good. But probing on func+4 is meaningless. Both func+0 and
func+4 call a handler with same pt_regs. And it should have the stack
pointer which is NOT modified by lr-saver and regs->lr must point original
call address. (ftrace regs caller must do this fixup for supporting live
patching correctly)

And in this case, func+4 has fake pt_regs because it skips lr-saver's
effects.

And even if you fixed up the pt_regs, there is another problem of what
user expects on the target instructions.

As you know, dynamic ftrace will fill the instruction with NOP (2 NOPs
in arm64), in this case, maybe pt_regs are same except pc on func+0 and
func+4. But if ftrace already enabled on the function, user will see
there are lr-saver and bl, oops. In this case we have to change pt_regs
between func+0 and func+4. So it depends on the current mode.

However, IMHO, it is not worth to pay such simulation cost. No one want
to probe such simulated intermediate address. It is easy to expect the
result from the code. Moreover, the func+4 will not appear on debuginfo
because those 2 special insturctions are just appended by the compiler,
not generated by the code.

So I don't think we need to support func+4. We only need func+0, or func+8
(this must be same as func+0 except regs->pc anyway)

Thank you,
