True, on the other hand it's not a very sensible condition to have
kvm_mwait_in_guest but not kvm_halt_in_guest.

hlt allows interrupts to be injected, which of course is not possible in
an interrupt-off region.  But, the only difference is that halt_poll is
not obeyed for synchronous page fault handling; either way, the vCPU
thread stays in the kernel but it is scheduled out while the page fault
is being handled.  This is only for lapic_in_kernel so hlt does not
leave KVM_RUN.

Fixed in v2 (keeping the if/else but swapping the two arms).
