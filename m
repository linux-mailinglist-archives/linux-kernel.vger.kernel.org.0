That (disable copy to/from user completely) would be a nice to have
since it would reduce the attack surface of the driver, but e.g. your
code already doesn't do that.

Right and it doesn't go away. You'll need to come up
with a test that messes it up and triggers a worst-case
scenario, so we can measure how bad is that worst-case.

I think the idea was, if GUP would need a pagefault, don't
do a GUP and do to/from user instead. Hopefully that
will fault the page in and the next access will go through.

Right, generally GUP.

No, I don't think it's considered best practice to allow unpriveledged
userspace control over whether kernel enables security features.

Permanent GUP breaks THP and NUMA.
