I would be lying if I said I don't have the itch to ;-)

One hopes that the tools are able to automatically resolve the resolution,
however adequate re-inspection of the resulting code and testing it would be
needed in either case, to ensure the conflict resolution (whether manual or
automatic) happened correctly.

IIUC, this usually depends on the maintainer's preference on which branch to
send patches against.

Are you saying -rcu's dev branch is still the best option to send patches
against, even though it is rebased often?

thanks,
