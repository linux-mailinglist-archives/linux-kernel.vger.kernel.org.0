Sure. The the intention was to avoid such a complication, merge two 
masks and provide explicit warning that the resulting mask is extended.

If you still see the checking and auto detection of the exact mask 
extension as essential it can be implemented.

1.  -g call-graph dwarf,K                         full_regs
2.  --user-regs=user_regs                         user_regs
3.  -g call-graph dwarf,K --user-regs=user_regs	  user_regs + dwarf_regs

The default behavior stays the same for cases 1, 2 above.
For case 3 register set becomes the one asked using --user_regs option.
If the option value misses IP or SP or the both then they are explicitly
added to the option value and a warning message mentioning the exact 
added registers is provided.

If you ask me, AFAIK, DWARF unwind rules sometimes can refer additional 
general purpose registers for frames boundaries calculation.
