Subject: [RFC PATCH] ceph: fix directories inode i_blkbits initialization
Date:   Tue, 23 Jul 2019 16:50:20 +0100

When filling an inode with info from the MDS, i_blkbits is being
initialized using fl_stripe_unit, which contains the stripe unit in
bytes.  Unfortunately, this doesn't make sense for directories as they
have fl_stripe_unit set to '0'.  This means that i_blkbits will be set
to 0xff, causing an UBSAN undefined behaviour in i_blocksize():

  UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in ./include/linux/fs.h:731:12
  shift exponent 255 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'

Fix this by initializing i_blkbits to CEPH_BLOCK_SHIFT if fl_stripe_unit
is zero.

Hi Jeff,

To be honest, I'm not sure CEPH_BLOCK_SHIFT is the right value to use
here, but for sure the one currently being used isn't correct if the
inode is a directory.  Using stripe units seems to be a bug that has
been there since the beginning, but it definitely became bigger problem
after commit 69448867abcb ("fs: shave 8 bytes off of struct inode").

This fix could also be moved into the 'switch' statement later in that
function, in the S_IFDIR case, similar to commit 5ba72e607cdb ("ceph:
set special inode's blocksize to page size").  Let me know which version
you would prefer.

Cheers,

Luis
