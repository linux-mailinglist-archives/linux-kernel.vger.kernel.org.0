I am not sure if I understood the below statement properly. Is there
something missing from it ?

The scmi protocol requires a block of shared memory which is
represented by struct scmi_shared_mem, and payload is this memory
block itself. This block of memory is accessed throughout driver.c
file using ioread/write commands. If payload is transport specific, so
will be those accesses, isn't it ? Are you suggesting to move all this
to mailbox.c (the transport specific file) instead ? I am sorry, but I
am not able to understand how exactly you want me to reorder code here
:(

@Sudeep: I had a question for you though. Looks like we are doing
ioremap() of this payload for every channel's tx/rx, why ? Why is the
same memory area mapped that way ? Can we just map the area once for
scmi block ?
