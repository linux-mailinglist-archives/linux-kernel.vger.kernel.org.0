Hi Heiner,

Thanks for the response, and sorry for some delay. I've been busy in the
last week.

Understood. But the register mapping for this part does appear to be the
same, and I'm really having trouble finding any other documentation, so
I can't really blame whoever was writing the Coreboot code in the first
place.

I already see the code, but do you have any reference docs? For example,
how am I to determine "has to"? I've totally failed at finding any good
documentation.

To the contrary, I did find an alleged RTL8169 document (no clue if it's
legit), and it appears to describe the IDR0-5 registers (i.e., offset
0000h) as:

  ID Register 0: The ID registers 0-5 are only permitted to write by
  4-byte access. Read access can be byte, word, or double word access.
  The initial value is autoloaded from EEPROM EthernetID field. 

If that implies anything, it seems to imply that any EEPROM settings
should be automatically applied, and that register 0-5h are the correct
source of truth.

Or it doesn't really imply anything, except that some other similar IP
doesn't specifically mention this "backup register."

> If recompiling the BIOS isn't an option,

It's not 100% impossible, but it seems highly unlikely to happen. To me
(and likely the folks responsible for this BIOS), this looks like a
kernel regression (this driver worked just fine for me before commit
89cceb2729c7).

No, I think the easiest option is to apply my patch, which I'll probably
do if I can't find anything else.

I'm curious: do you see any problem with my patch? In your
understanding, what's the purpose of the "backup registers" (as they
were called in commit 89cceb2729c7)? To be the primary source of MAC
address information? Or to only be a source if the primary registers are
empty? If the latter, then my patch should be a fine substitute.
