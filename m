Fix current BUG_ON() by not releasing buffer after write-back. Decide what
to do for write back and then a page is pin. It will happens once we are
done with pin changes and the infrastructure is in place. It will be done
by John or others.

It is a race thing so it does not necesarily happens, the longer the pin
the higher risk. It can only happens with some fs (i forgot which ones but
you can go read the previous threads). It is easy to fix all we need to
do is not release some fs structure of pinned pages after write-back.

When user of GUP calls set_page_dirty() they _must_ be done with using the
page and it is the case today AFAICT, so no pending DMA. The GUP pin is
release after set_page_dirty() by all current users.

Note that current users all do that once they are done and they can hold
the pages for an _indifinite_ amount of time ie forever. They do dirty
pages in their teardown code path.

Hence the question that we need ti answer is what to do for dirty pages
while they are GUPed. Note that a page can be set dirty while GUPed
because CPU access can still happens and thus the regular dirtyness
tracking mechanism do operate on such page.

So page can go through:
    - GUPed by someone
    - write by CPU, mark as dirty
    - regular write-back kicks in
    - page is mark clean and fs might release data structure

    ... any amount of time ... what to do here if more CPU writes ?

    - GUPed user done and put_page but before call set_page_dirty()
      this might BUG_ON() inside fs code for some fs if the page was
      left clean on the CPU since last writeback

I would strongly advise to read previous thread this was discussed at
length.
