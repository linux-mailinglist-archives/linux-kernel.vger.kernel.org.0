That would only mean a single additional entry for the Gen1 devices.
This is not a valid argument for a separate driver, especially since
the difference in scaling only affects a single parameter as far as I
can see.

This is not a valid argument either. We have, for example, a single driver
for all Linear chips, even though they have quite some difference across
individual chips. The above can simply be solved by not instantiating
debugfs for Gen1 devices, and marking VMON as supported for Gen2 devices
only. If the Gen1 devices are all pretty much the same, you'd only need
a single additional table entry for those in the driver (if you insist
using a table).

For the debugfs functions, please keep in mind that those will have to be
documented in a way that lets people without access to datasheets
understand what they are for. We can't have cryptic debugfs functions
which, if misused, blow up the chip.

Also a fair point showing that not having the datasheet hurts. I see the same
problem with recent TI devices. In some cases I _know_ that a driver is buggy
or much less than perfect, because I have access to a datasheet through
my employer, but I can't talk about it because what I know is under NDA.
Then I end up spending a lot of time trying to find leaks that let me comment.
I am _not_ happy about this situation, not at all.

Please understand that I won't accept a driver adding support for a chip
if there is no public information available that the chip exists in the
first place. Imagine a situation where you are requesting to add support
for a chip, and that chip isn't mentioned anywhere, not even in a datasheet
I (hypothetically) may have access to through my employer. How would _you_
handle such a situation if you were in my place ?

You could of course send me all the datasheets under NDA to my work e-mail,
but that wouldn't really be much better since I still would not be able to
comment in public. On the other side, I'd have at least some confirmation
that those magic chips do indeed exist, so you might possibly want to
consider that.

Thanks,
Guenter
