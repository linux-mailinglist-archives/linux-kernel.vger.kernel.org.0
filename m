There is a plan to solve the NMI issue. Although there is one case we might
be showing as a spurious that might not be nice. If #MCE's showup there is
nothing we can do at that point. These are most likely unrecoverable. 
But we want to make sure we could atleast follow through with a proper reset.

Let me gather my thoughts on that when i have the patch ready to handle
those senarios.

Excellent point.

I have started the conversation internally. Once we have something solid
I'll share in the list, and also follow up with updates to SDM.
