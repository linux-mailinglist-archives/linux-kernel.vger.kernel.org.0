Absolutely.

This looks like a similar issue to the AUDIT_NETFILTER_CFG issue where
we get a lone record unconnected to a syscall when one of the netfilter
table initialization (ipv4 filter) is linked into the kernel rather than
compiled as a module, so it is run in kernel context at boot rather than
in user context as a module load later.  This is why I ask if it is
being run by a kernel thread rather than a user task, perhaps using a
syscall function call internally.
