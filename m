I don't think it's a strong enough argument for rejecting this change.
Suspecting that something might go wrong if we simplify something is a
valid call to proceed with caution and be on the lookout for potential
regressions so we can react fast. I respect that. But it's not
necessarily a good argument to reject a change.

I'm happy to switch from an initializer (which is not even clear is a
bug) to using clear_siginfo().
And I'm also going to split this patch out of the P_PIDFD patch but I'm
going to send this out again. I haven't heard a sound argument why this
patch is worse than what we have right now in there.
