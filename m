There's only one qfprom and there's the address space that's
"uncorrected" which is not supposed to be used and there's the space
that is "corrected" and is supposed to be used. It looks like this is
poking the uncorrected space and it should probably stop doing that and
use the nvmem provider instead. Maybe someone with docs for this chip
and 8996 can help confirm this.
