Hmmm.  Which are the "tested trees"?

This bug (e1d1a6e595adbd2458f1) is marked as a duplicate of 
3cbe5cd105d2ad56a1df.  The dashboard link says that bug was fixed by 
commit "HID: logitech: Fix general protection fault caused by Logitech 
driver" -- which is correct, as far as I know.

That commit is present in linux-next, as mentioned above.  As of 10:44 
EDT today, it is not present in Linus's tree, according to

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/drivers/hid/hid-lg.c

(in fact, no commits affecting drivers/hid/hid-lg.c in that tree are 
dated after 2019-07-10).

Furthermore, according to

https://github.com/google/kmsan/blob/master/drivers/hid/hid-lg.c?h=014077b5

the source code actually used by syzbot for this test doesn't have that 
commit either.  (BTW, is there any way to get a git log out of github?  
It would be nice not to have to download the whole source file -- and 
I'm not certain that this URL really does point to the version of the 
file that syzbot used.)

So what's really going on?
