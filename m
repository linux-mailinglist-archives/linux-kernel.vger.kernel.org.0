What we do for the IO controller is execute the work unthrottled but
charge the cgroup on whose behalf we are executing with whatever cost
or time or bandwith that was incurred. The cgroup will pay off this
debt when it requests more of that resource.

This is from blk-iocost.c:

	/*
	 * We're over budget.  If @bio has to be issued regardless,
	 * remember the abs_cost instead of advancing vtime.
	 * iocg_kick_waitq() will pay off the debt before waking more IOs.
	 * This way, the debt is continuously paid off each period with the
	 * actual budget available to the cgroup.  If we just wound vtime,
	 * we would incorrectly use the current hw_inuse for the entire
	 * amount which, for example, can lead to the cgroup staying
	 * blocked for a long time even with substantially raised hw_inuse.
	 */
	if (bio_issue_as_root_blkg(bio) || fatal_signal_pending(current)) {
		atomic64_add(abs_cost, &iocg->abs_vdebt);
		iocg_kick_delay(iocg, &now, cost);
		return;
	}

blk-iolatency.c has similar provisions. bio_issue_as_root_blkg() says this:

/**
 * bio_issue_as_root_blkg - see if this bio needs to be issued as root blkg
 * @return: true if this bio needs to be submitted with the root blkg context.
 *
 * In order to avoid priority inversions we sometimes need to issue a bio as if
 * it were attached to the root blkg, and then backcharge to the actual owning
 * blkg.  The idea is we do bio_blkcg() to look up the actual context for the
 * bio and attach the appropriate blkg to the bio.  Then we call this helper and
 * if it is true run with the root blkg for that queue and then do any
 * backcharging to the originating cgroup once the io is complete.
 */
static inline bool bio_issue_as_root_blkg(struct bio *bio)
{
        return (bio->bi_opf & (REQ_META | REQ_SWAP)) != 0;
}

The plan for the CPU controller is similar. When a remote execution
begins, flush the current runtime accumulated (update_curr) and
associate the current thread with another cgroup (similar to
current->active_memcg); when remote execution is done, flush the
runtime delta to that cgroup and unset the remote context.

For async reclaim, whether that's kswapd or the work item that I'm
adding here, we'd want the cycles to go to the cgroup whose memory is
being reclaimed.

Sorry, they're not in Rik's patch. My point was that we haven't gotten
to making such fine-grained annotations because the CPU isolation as a
whole isn't something we have working in practice right now. It's not
relevant who is spending the cycles if we cannot enable CPU control.
