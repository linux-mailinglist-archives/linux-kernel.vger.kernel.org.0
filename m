OK, then you can add:

Acked-by: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>

to this one.

So far as I can remember, my thinking was that only non-shared IRQs
will have notifiers and only the current user of the IRQ will set the
notifier.  The doc comment for irq_set_affinity_notifier() implies the
latter restriction, but it might be worth spelling this out explicitly.
