-- Rob has answered it, with current change disable_dpu will only be 
called during pm_suspend.

* What happens if suspend is aborted partway through (by getting a
wakeup even as you're suspending, for instance)?  In such a case some
of the normal suspend calls will be called but "suspend_late" won't be
called.  Does that mess up your counting?

-- I understand this concern, i'll explore a bit more on how to handle 
"failed to suspend","early awake"
cases (to restore the usage_count) since suspend_late wont be called.

*From your description, it sure seems like this part of the
runtime_pm.rst doc is relevant to you:

Did I misunderstand and this isn't what you want?  Looking a bit
further, maybe the right thing is to use the "SMART_SUSPEND" flag?

-- if you notice in the device_prepare 
(https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/base/power/main.c#L1913)
there is a pm_runtime_get_noresume at L1931, which will increment the 
usagecount before triggering client prepare call, hence implementing 
prepare wont fetch us much.

This appears to be more for the cases when device is runtime suspended 
and suspend followed later
"one example usecase that i can think of, is screen timeout after that 
suspend is triggered"

currently the problem i am looking at is that
	PM Core does +1 in device prepare
		DPU driver does -1 in suspend
		DPU driver does +1 in suspend late  ( look for right place )
	PM core does -1 in device complete

i'll get back after exploring a bit.
