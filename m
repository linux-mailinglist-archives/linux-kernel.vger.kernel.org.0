Ah, it's part of my last "for-linus" series. I usually wait a day to
see if there's issues before sending Linus a pull request. An issue was
found in a randconfig and this patch fixes it. I added the "for-linus"
as it was attached to my pull request that had the commit with the
issue.

I could have added this patch as [for-linus][PATCH 16/15] ;-)
