FYI, For when CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO is defined, in logical PIO space, we 
reserve the last 0x4000 bytes for Indirectio, while the rest is 
available for MMIO. When CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO is not defined, all Logical 
PIO space is available for MMIO.

ioport of 0x0 seems fine. Here is my IO port listing for my host (which 
defines PCI_IOBASE):

00000000-0000ffff : PCI Bus 0002:f8
   00001000-00001fff : PCI Bus 0002:f9

I'm not sure what you mean by simply the hw address.

So there is the physical cpu address of the host bridge IO ports, and 
these host bridge IO ports are mapped in pci_remap_iospace() to some 
part of logical PIO space. The base of the logical PIO space corresponds 
to PCI_IOBASE virtual address.

Please check 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/lib/logic_pio.c?h=v5.6-rc2#n231 
for reference:

#if defined(CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO) && defined(PCI_IOBASE)
#define BUILD_LOGIC_IO(bw, type)					\
type logic_in##bw(unsigned long addr)					\{									\	type ret = 
(type)~0;						\									\	if (addr < MMIO_UPPER_LIMIT) {					\		ret = 
read##bw(PCI_IOBASE + addr);			\	} else if (addr >= MMIO_UPPER_LIMIT && 
addr < IO_SPACE_LIMIT) { \		struct logic_pio_hwaddr *entry = 
find_io_range(addr);	\									\		if (entry)						\			ret = 
entry->ops->in(entry->hostdata,		\					addr, sizeof(type));		\		else				 
		\			WARN_ON_ONCE(1);				\	}								\	return ret;							\}											

For when the IO port address is within the MMIO range (addr < 
MMIO_UPPER_LIMIT), we use readl(PCI_IOBASE + addr); please remember that 
PCI_IOBASE virtual address is mapped to the physical host bridge IO port 
address.

For when CONFIG_INDIRECT_PIO is not defined, we use the asm generic version:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/asm-generic/io.h?h=v5.6-rc2#n461

As an aside, I do notice that the definitions here have changed here in 
87fe2d543f81 ("io: change inX() to have their own IO barrier overrides") 
since we introduced logic PIO.

I hope the above description makes this clearer.

What is the reason that we are trying to
>> allocate a io_start for MMIO rather than take their hw_start ioport directly?

For PCI MMIO, the io_start is the Logical PIO range start address.
