HI Marc,

Thanks for detailed explanation, Yes we have mapped all 8 distributors 
now to resolve.
But my main concern is that last 4 redistributor is not connected to 
core, as core is not present.
And as per gic driver it seems we are only
iterating and populating per cpu rd pointer.

So that would be fine correct, seems nothing wrong in this kind of 
configuration?
