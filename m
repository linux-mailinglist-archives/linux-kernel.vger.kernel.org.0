This isn't *technically* communicating information back to the
firmware, since the agent that ends up being invoked is a driver that
has been explicitly installed in order to permit running Linux without
hacking about with GRUB. (But it's certainly communicating it back to
the firmware context.)

I guess it's worth pointing out here that this approach (DtbLoader)
predates the finding out that these devices use PEP instead of ACPI
for power management (which I guess makes it ACI) - so ACPI can never
be usefully supported.

Wo-hoo...

So does GRUB.

DtbLoader looks up the DT through the system table again as part of
the ExitBootservices hook. An address change *or* a CRC change
triggers the ACPI deletion.

This was the problem Rob was trying to address - ensuring the hook
gets invoked even where the stub was the one that updated the DT.

But given the situation we're in, I don't really disagree with you
anyway.

Let's just be clear that this isn't a free-for-all - this is because
the abstraction of power management on this family of machines is
broken by design.

If so, some form of (out-of-tree) sanity check would be needed on
distros carrying out-of-tree patches that disable DT boot.

It *is* possible to boot these machines using only ACPI. It's just not
a very great user experience with all cores running at minimum
frequency.
