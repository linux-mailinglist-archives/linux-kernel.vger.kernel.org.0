Ah, OK, I hadn't thought of that one.

Ya, that's fine.  It's just an extra 0-length file that doesn't get built
("file." instead of "file.c"), which explains how it went unnoticed.  That
said, it's a bit of an embarassment and I wanted to submit two more patches
anyway so I was going to send another PR.  The rebased patches are sitting on
my for-next now, I'll send them up tomorrow unless someone points something
out.

Thanks for the quick reply!
