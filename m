If the compiler can see the callee wants the same TOC as the caller has,
it does not arrange to set (and restore) it, no.  If it sees it may be
different, it does arrange for that (and the linker then will check if
it actually needs to do anything, and do that if needed).

In this case, the compiler cannot know the callee wants the same TOC,
which complicates thing a lot -- but it all works out.

I think things can still go wrong if any of this is inlined into a kernel
module?  Is there anything that prevents this / can this not happen for
some fundamental reason I don't see?
