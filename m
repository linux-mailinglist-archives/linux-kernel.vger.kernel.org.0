I've pointed the kgdbtest suite at this patch (and run one of the
historically unstable test cases an extra 100 times just in case).

kgdbtest hasn't got great coverage, runs the code in qemu and some
of the strongest tests are still marked XFAIL on arm64 (for reasons
unrelated to stepping).

So the best I can say based on the above is that the test suite does not
observe any regression (but equally no improvement). Nevertheless FWIW:
