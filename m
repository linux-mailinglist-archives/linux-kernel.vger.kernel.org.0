Doing the random seed in the boot loader is nice for two reasons:

1. It runs very very early, so that the OS can come up with fully
   initialized entropy right from the beginning.

2. The boot loader generally has found some disk to read the kernel from,
   i.e. has a place where stuff can be stored and which can be updated
   (most modern boot loaders can write to disk these days, and so can
   EFI). Thus, it can derive a new random seed from a stored seed on disk
   and pass it to the OS *AND* update it right away on disk ensuring that
   it is never reused again. The point where the OS kernel comes to an
   equivalent point where it can write to disk is much much later,
   i.e. after the initrd, after the transition to the actual OS, ony
   after /var has been remounted writable.

So to me this is not about trust, but about "first place we can read
*AND* write a seed on disk".

i.e. the key to grok here: it's not OK to use a stored seed unless you
can at the same time update the it on disk, as only that protects you
from reusing the key if the system's startup is aborted due to power
failure or such.

NVRAM backing EFI vars sucks. Nothing you want to update on every
cycle. It's OK to update during OS installation, but during every
single boot? I'd rather not.
