Hi Ard, Will,

This week we were trying to debug an issue of time consuming in mem_init(),
and leading to this similar solution form Jia He, so I would like to bring this
thread back, please see my detail test result below.

Testing this patch set on top of Kunpeng 920 based ARM64 server, with
384G memory in total, we got the time consuming below

             without this patch set      with this patch set
mem_init()        13310ms                      1415ms

So we got about 8x speedup on this machine, which is very impressive.

The time consuming is related the memory DIMM size and where to locate those
memory DIMMs in the slots. In above case, we are using 16G memory DIMM.
We also tested 1T memory with 64G size for each memory DIMM on another ARM64
machine, the time consuming reduced from 20s to 2s (I think it's related to
firmware implementations).

Indeed this patch set has a bug, For exampe, if we have 3 regions which
is [a, b] [c, d] [e, f] if address of pfn is bigger than the end address of
last region, we will increase early_region_idx to count of region, which is
out of bound of the regions. Fixed by patch below,

As the really impressive speedup on our ARM64 server system, could you reconsider
this patch set for merge? if you want more data I'm willing to clarify and give
more test.

Thanks
Hanjun
