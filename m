Thanks for pointing out this.

Agree, for ftrace, it's complex and there have multiple pathes to use
aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync().

Below flow uses stop_machine() in ftrace:

  ftrace_run_stop_machine()
   stop_machine(__ftrace_modify_code, &command, NULL);
     __ftrace_modify_code()
       ftrace_modify_all_code()
         ftrace_update_ftrace_func()
           ftrace_modify_code()
             aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync()

Below flow doesn't use stop_machine() in ftrace:

  prepare_coming_module()
    ftrace_module_enable()
      process_cached_mods()
        process_mod_list()
          ftrace_hash_move_and_update_ops()
            ftrace_ops_update_code()
              ftrace_ops_update_code()
                ftrace_run_modify_code()
                  ftrace_run_update_code()
                    arch_ftrace_update_code()
                      ftrace_modify_all_code()
                        ftrace_update_ftrace_func()
                          ftrace_modify_code()
                            aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync()

Actually, there have other flows also will call into
aarch64_insn_patch_text_nosync(), so at least we cannot say all ftrace
flow uses stop_machine() to alter instructions.

Very appreciate for the posted code (and another minor fixing in your
next replying), the logic is quite clear.

Will do prototype for this, at the meantime, I'd like to give a bit more
time for Will (or other Arm maintainers) to review this.

Thanks,
