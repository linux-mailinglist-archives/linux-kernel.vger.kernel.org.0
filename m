Ok opps, I might have missed some thing.
I just look into logs to between syscore shutdown and I2C shutdown
get more insight, so I feel I2C shutdown dose clean shutdown.

I have tired this I2C shutdown approach earlier, but as their were
issue with clean restart, so I dropped this line.
Then I tired to add restart notifier to handle restart that also
did not work my boards, so I am exploring more.

If we go with I2C shutdown feature, some how some device will not
release resources and it remains stuck before the initialization next u-boo=
t.
See the log below. https://pastebin.com/xxwvERaz

ATF changes will some into affect after the restart of the devices.
FYI I am testing with all the latest AFT patches from Armbian and latest u-=
boot.
