Well, I didn't ignore them. It just wasn't clear to me from the previous
discussions which way you want to go.

I guess, we can have a look at other interrupt controllers and how they
handle the interrupt-map property. For example:

 https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/renesas,rza1-irqc.txt

I need to send a v7 anyway, because I forgot to include the SOC_LS1021A
in the build process.

Keep in mind, that not all Layerscapes have that feature and the
corresponding register. As you said that may be handled via compatible
string. However, the bit-reverse property looks like the simplest
solution to me.
