I'm sure..

There's book 3, chapter 18, performance monitoring overview, that should
explain how the counters work, and chapter 19 that lists many of the
available events.

TL;DR, they're (48bit) signed counters that increment and raise an
interrupt when the sign flips. This means we set them to '-period' and
then upon read (either early or on interrupt) compute the delta and
accumulate elsewhere.

I don't actually know what's in that manpage. But it really shouldn't be
too hard to understand.

It's a seqcount protected set of value, there's the RDPMC counter index,
and the counter offset. If the idx!=0 it means the counter is actually
programmed and we must RDPMC, the result of which we must add to the
offset.

The whole counter scaling crud is just that, crud you can mostly forget
about if you want to quickly hack something together. See
mmap_read_pinned() for the simplified (and much faster version) that
ignores all that.

Depending on the usecase, sure. I don't mave use for it either. I know
other people find it useful.

Right, but if this is all you're running that is unlikely to happen.

You still need to do the rdpmc sign extent crud, but see
mmap_read_pinned() that does just about that.

As the name suggests it relies on using perf_event_attr::pinned = 1.
