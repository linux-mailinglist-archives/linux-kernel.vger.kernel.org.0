I did some testing with a small & simple rt-app based test-case:

2 CPUs (rq->cpu_capacity_orig=1024), CPUfreq performance governor

2 taskgroups /tg0 and /tg1

6 CFS tasks (periodic, 8/16ms (runtime/period))

/tg0 (cpu.shares=1024) ran 4 tasks and /tg1 (cpu.shares=1024) ran 2 tasks

(arm64 defconfig with !CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING, !CONFIG_SCHED_AUTOGROUP)

---

v5.2:

The 2 /tg1 tasks ran 8/16ms. The 4 /tg0 tasks ran 4/16ms in the
beginning and then 8/16ms after the 2 /tg1 tasks did finish.

---

v5.2 + v4:

There is no runtime/period pattern visible anymore. I see a lot of extra
wakeup latency for those tasks though.

v5.2 + (v4 without 07/15, 08/15, 15/15) didn't change much.

---

I could try to reduce the stack even further (e.g. without 13/15).

IMHO it's a good idea to have a set of these small & simple test-cases
handy to verify that the base-functionality is still in place. This
might be hard to achieve with benchmarks.
