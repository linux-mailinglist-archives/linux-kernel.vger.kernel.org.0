I am still struggling to see how these use-cases require in-kernel
DAMON. For THP promotion/demotaion, madvise(MADV_[NO]HUGEPAGE) can be
used or we can introduce a new MADV_HUGIFY to synchronously convert
small pages to hugepages. Page migration on tier-memory is similar to
proactive reclaim and we already have migrate_pages/move_pages
syscalls. Basically why userspace DAMON can not perform these
operations?

Again I feel like these should be done in user space as these are more
policies instead of mechanisms. However if it can be shown that doing
that in userspace is very expensive as compared to in-kernel solution
then we can think about it.

See below on physical memory monitoring.

So, users can select to not merge the regions to keep the monitoring
