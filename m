Well if the full thing needs the blob (otherwise how do you get at the
SRM), then the blob needs to be open, or we need something else.

Uh that's what I meant, now we'll end up with 2 ways to handle the
SRM. We already have a drm core interface to upload the SRM from disk,
please use that one, not invent a new one. Yes you need to add 1 tiny
function to drm_hdcp.c to get at the raw srm instead of checking for a
revoked ksv.
