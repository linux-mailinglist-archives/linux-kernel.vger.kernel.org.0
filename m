Thanks!  Figuring out how the io controllers dealt with remote charging was on
my list, this makes it easier.

Ok, consistency with io and memory is one advantage to doing it that way.
Creating kthreads in cgroups also seems viable so far, and it's unclear whether
either approach is significantly simpler or more maintainable than the other,
at least to me.

Is someone on your side working on remote charging right now?  I was planning
to post an RFD comparing these soon and it would make sense to include them.
