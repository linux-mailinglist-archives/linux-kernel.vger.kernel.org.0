This hunk is lacking rtd1395, so is not based on the latest patches I
posted. I expect you to be developing against linux-next.git tree, and
when there's relevant in-flight patches, you'll need to either apply my
patches via git-am to your tree, or for convenience you can use the
beginning of my (but better not the full experimental) rtd1295-next
branch (git-rebase -i, or (careful!) git-reset --hard). Yes, neither is
super-easy.

Same as with the binding, it would seem better to not add this at the
end, even if it's your newest family. Consider this: Someone finds an
RTD1036 in their household and wants to contribute a patch - where would
they add it? I don't want all newly added stuff to go into the bottom of
the file (then it'll be hard to find and potentially causes conflicts),
so we need a stable sort order where I don't need to do historical
research of whether 1036 is newer or older than 1195/1296 to determine
where to insert it in a file. Alphanumerical sort order seems simplest
to understand and is proven elsewhere to reduce merge conflicts.

No! I understood RTD1319 has the same boot ROM size 184 KiB as RTD1619,
so please look at the patches I posted, including fix for RTD1619 [1],
and fix this yourself here. A comment for humans would also be nice.

In the public BPI-M4-bsp code I see one -pymparticle-1GB.CMAx2.dts file.
If this board is available with less than 2 GiB RAM then please use the
lower value to be safe - you can run a 2 GiB board with 1 GiB RAM used,
but using more RAM than available will break.

I note this seems a different cache topology than RTD1619?

@Robin, is this single PPI interrupt better than previous single SPI?

Is "arm,armv8-pmuv3" the correct one to use for Cortex-A55? There's no
"arm,cortex-a55-pmu" binding - is that still in the works?

@Lorenzo: Same question as left unanswered for RTD1619:
Should this be "arm,psci-1.0", "arm-psci-0.2"?

The YAML schema allows both, without clearly documenting which one shall
be used in new DTs, and there's no psci-1.0 example either.

BTW I recall seeing "osc27m" in your clk patchset. We should decide on
one name and stick with it consistently, and I think it's best to have
this as a node here in .dtsi (or in .dts), in case OEMs ever choose to
have it generated by some other non-trivial IC.

No! Lacking a range for boot ROM. And your range is probably too large
due to high RAM. Please see [1] and fix for both. r-bus ranges below
would indicate that above soc range should be 0x00200000 long only, plus
extra ranges for whatever besides r-bus is shadowing RAM (e.g., GIC).

Thanks for incorporating r-bus right away.

Here you appear to ignore my patches introducing syscon for ISO & MISC!

Please review patches that have been posted to the list, and incorporate
such fixes and refactorings into any new patches. If you disagree with
my patchsets, then you need to reply to them! If my numbers and naming
are correct on the other hand, you and your colleagues are encouraged to
respond to patches with an Acked-by, or Reviewed-by if you've reviewed
the full patch, and/or Tested-by if you've tested it on some board
(usually with comment on where/what you did). As long as no compatible
strings get introduced, it is within my discretion to apply DT patches
to linux-realtek.git if no review comments arrive asking for changes, so
you can safely assume that I'll apply my own non-RFC patches otherwise.
Not responding to patches and silently subverting them is not the way to
go. linux-realtek-soc is still fairly small in volume compared to LAKML,
so that I do expect contributors to at least skim patch subjects and
cover letters for any conflicting/relevant work before posting patches.
Don't expect maintainers to apply a v1 patch and to fix it up for you.

For Acked-by vs. Reviewed-by, compare this and the next section:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#when-to-use-acked-by-cc-and-co-developed-by

If you want to post patches that you know are not yet ready for merging,
you can use --subject-prefix="RFC", like I did for the SoC info series.
The cover letter should explain the main discussion points then.

Thanks in advance,

Andreas
