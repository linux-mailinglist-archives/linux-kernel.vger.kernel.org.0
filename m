Subject: [PATCH 1/3] mm, meminit: Recalculate pcpu batch and high limits after init completes

Deferred memory initialisation updates zone->managed_pages during
the initialisation phase but before that finishes, the per-cpu page
allocator (pcpu) calculates the number of pages allocated/freed in
batches as well as the maximum number of pages allowed on a per-cpu list.
As zone->managed_pages is not up to date yet, the pcpu initialisation
calculates inappropriately low batch and high values.

This increases zone lock contention quite severely in some cases with the
degree of severity depending on how many CPUs share a local zone and the
size of the zone. A private report indicated that kernel build times were
excessive with extremely high system CPU usage. A perf profile indicated
that a large chunk of time was lost on zone->lock contention.

This patch recalculates the pcpu batch and high values after deferred
initialisation completes for every populated zone in the system. It
was tested on a 2-socket AMD EPYC 2 machine using a kernel compilation
workload -- allmodconfig and all available CPUs.

mmtests configuration: config-workload-kernbench-max
Configuration was modified to build on a fresh XFS partition.

The patch reduces system CPU usage by 69.86% and total build time by
26.65%. The variance of system CPU usage is also much reduced.

Before, this was the breakdown of batch and high values over all zones was.

    256               batch: 1
    256               batch: 63
    512               batch: 7
    256               high:  0
    256               high:  378
    512               high:  42

512 pcpu pagesets had a batch limit of 7 and a high limit of 42. After the patch

    256               batch: 1
    768               batch: 63
    256               high:  0
    768               high:  378
