Sorry yes that's what I meant, my wording was imprecise. If a timer has 
only one input capture channel, no arguments are needed to specify the 
channel in the timer-input-capture property and #input-capture-cells 
would be <0>.

Yeah, maybe rename the properties to #timer-capture-cells and timer-capture.

Yes, it does bother me somewhat that

timer-capture = <&gpt 0>;

is referring to the timer itself and not its input-capture functionality.

Maybe it would be better, since the timer has multiple functions, to 
make the timer compatible with simple-mfd, so that a timer-capture 
sub-device can be defined, for example on i.MX6:

gpt: timer@2098000 {
         compatible = "fsl,imx6q-gpt", "fsl,imx31-gpt", "simple-mfd";
         /* ... */

	tcap: timer-capture {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6q-gpt-capture";
		#timer-capture-cells = <1>;
		pinctrl-names = "default", "icap1";
         	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_gpt_input_capture0>;
         	pinctrl-1 = <&pinctrl_gpt_input_capture1>;
	};
};

some-device {
         /* ... */
         timer-capture = <&tcap 0>;
};

That's a thought, but I'm not sure how the kernel API would look in that 
case, i.e. it would not be as straightforward to locate the timer 
clocksource driver that contains the timer capture support. The 
advantage of using a 'timer-capture' property that contains a timer 
phandle, is that it is simple to locate the clocksource driver that has 
the timer capture function.

In this specific use-case, the i.MX6 CSI often cannot recover from 
corrupted frame synchronization info in the incoming video frames, 
especially for BT.656 sources (too many or too few lines between two 
SAV/EAV codes, or missing codes altogether). The result is loss of 
vertical sync in the captured frames. The only indication of this error 
condition on i.MX6 is a drop in the captured frame intervals. So a 
workaround is to implement a frame interval monitor that measures the 
FI's and reports a V4L2 event to userspace when a FI falls outside some 
tolerance value. Userspace can then take corrective action such as 
restarting video streaming. Finally getting to the use-case here, the 
most accurate way to measure FI's is to capture a timer counter between 
two falling edges of a VSYNC signal from the video source.
