Yes, in case we're back to the idea to filter things out in QEMU we can
do this. What I don't like is that every other userspace which decides
to enable eVMCS will have to perform the exact same surgery as in case
it sets allow_unsupported_controls=0 it'll have to know (hardcode) the
filtering (or KVM_SET_MSRS will fail) and in case it opts for
allow_unsupported_controls=1 Windows guests just won't boot without the
filtering.

It seems to be 1:1, eVMCSv1 requires the filter.

Personally, I'd call it 'keep_unsupported_controls'.
