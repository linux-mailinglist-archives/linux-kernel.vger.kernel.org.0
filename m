Rename the block documentation files to ReST, add an
index for them and adjust in order to produce a nice html
output via the Sphinx build system.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

 To choose IO schedulers at boot time, use the argument 'elevator=deadline'.
 'noop' and 'cfq' (the default) are also available. IO schedulers are assigned
 globally at boot time only presently.
 
 Each io queue has a set of io scheduler tunables associated with it. These
 tunables control how the io scheduler works. You can find these entries

 the fly to select one of mq-deadline, none, bfq, or kyber schedulers -
 which can improve that device's throughput.
