INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_AIRMONT_NP was used keeping in mind the recommended

symbol naming form i.e. INTEL_FAM6{OPTFAMILY}_{MICROARCH}{OPTDIFF}

where OPTDIFF is supposed to be the market segment.


This SoC uses AMT (Admantium/Airmont) configuration which is supposed to be

a higher configuration. Looking at other existing examples, it seems that

INTEL_FAM6_ATOM_AIRMONT_PLUS is most appropriate. Would you have any

concerns with _PLUS name ? Thanks.
