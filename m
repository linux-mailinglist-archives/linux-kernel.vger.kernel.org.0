Yes, I get your point. But the intention is to avoid another hacky trick
(LD_PRELOAD), thus *something* should *preferably* be done on the
kernel level instead.

Regarding side-channel attacks, yes, I think so. Were those openssl guys

Timofey, could you please address this?

Also, just for the sake of another piece of stats here:

$ echo "$(cat /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_sharing) * 4 / 1024" | bc
526

Yup, looks appealing. Two concerns, though:

1) we are falling back to scanning through the list of tasks (I guess
this is what we wanted to avoid, although this time it happens in the
userspace);

2) what kinds of opt-out we should maintain? Like, what if force_madvise
is called, but the task doesn't want some VMAs to be merged? This will
required new flag anyway, it seems. And should there be another
write-only file to unmerge everything forcibly for specific task?

Thanks.

P.S. Cc'ing Pavel properly this time.
