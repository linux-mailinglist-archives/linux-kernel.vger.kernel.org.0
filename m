It entirely depends on what the goal is :-/ On the one hand I see why
people might want function tracing / kprobes enabled, OTOH it's all
mighty frigging scary. Any tracing/probing/whatever on an MCE has the
potential to make a bad situation worse -- not unlike the same on #DF.

The same with that compiler instrumentation crap; allowing kprobes on
*SAN code has the potential to inject probes in arbitrary random code.
At the same time, if you're running a kernel with that on and injecting
kprobes in it, you're welcome to own the remaining pieces.

How far do we want to go? At some point I think we'll have to give
people rope, show then the knot and leave them be.

Right, so I think avoiding the obvious recursion issues is a more
tractable problem and yes some 'safe' spot annotation should be enough
to get automation working for that -- mostly.
