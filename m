Putting parent clocks into 'clocks' for a device is a pretty common
abuse. The 'assigned-clocks' binding is what's used for parent clock
setup. Not sure that's going to help here though. Is this dance
because the parent clock frequency can't be changed cleanly? If up to
me, I'd put that dance in the clock driver. The GPU shouldn't have to
care.
