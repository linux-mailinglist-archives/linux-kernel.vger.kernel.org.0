Yes, I am able to adapt this patch set for TurboSched and proves useful for
classifying low latency requiring tasks and pack those on fewer number of
cores. I am able to pack the tasks having
latency_tolerance==MAX_LATENCY_TOLERANCE.

I will send the RFC v6 of the TurboSched soon on the lkml, which uses the
latency_{nice/tolerance}.
