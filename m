I've added regulator support in this series and I've refactored this
code as I went along. I fully expect to squash some of the refactors
once the final result of the series is acceptable.

It's not clear to me if you got to the end of the series and still
think the final result needs to be refactored. Let me know what you
think about this towards the end of the series and I can clean it up
if you still think it needs some clean up.
