Actually, what gets in the way is the CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO.
We can keep CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT together with COMPATCC initialised to
$(CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT)gcc. When we will be able to build the compat
vDSO with clang, we just pass COMPATCC=clang on the make line and the
kernel Makefile will figure out the --target option from
CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT (see how CLANG_FLAGS is handled).

If we stick only to env variables or make cmd line (without Kconfig) for
the compiler name, we can add a COMPATCC_IS_CLANG in the Kconfig
directly and simply not allow the enabling the COMPAT_VDSO if we don't
have the right compiler. This saves us warnings during build.

Since we don't have a CONFIG_* option for the cross-compiler prefix, we
shouldn't have one for the compat compiler either. If you want to build
the compat vDSO with clang, just pass COMPATCC=clang together with
CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT. We can add Kconfig checks to actually verify that
COMPATCC generates 32-bit binaries (e.g. COMPATCC_CAN_LINK32).

At the moment it's rather theoretical.
