Because the syscall will have the option to return what random data
was available in this case, while if you try to fix it only from
within systemd you currently don't even get that data.

I personally see this very differently. If randoms were placed into a
kernel compared to other operating systems doing everything in userspace,
it's in part because it requires to collect data very widely to gather
some entropy and that no isolated userspace alone can collect as much
as the kernel. Or they each have to reimplement their own method, each
with their own bugs, instead of fixing them all at a single place. All
applications need random, there's no reason for having to force them
all to implement them in detail.
