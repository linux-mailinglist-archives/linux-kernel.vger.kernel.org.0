CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT is called like this for symmetry with CROSS_COMPILE.

clang requires the --target option for specifying the 32bit triple.
Basically $(TRIPLE)-gcc is equivalent to gcc --target $(TRIPLE).
We need a configuration option to encode this.

Do we have any code of this kind in header files?

The vDSO library uses only a subset of the headers (mainly Macros) hence all the
unused symbols should be compiled out. Is your concern only theoretical or do
you have an example on where this could be happening?
