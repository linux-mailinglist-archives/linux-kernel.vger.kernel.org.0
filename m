In UBIFS the dump_stack() calls are more or less a WARN_ON().
Such situations should not happen. If they do, we want the details.

So, in the long rung we could replace most of them by a WARN_ON().
Maybe even WARN_ON_ONCE().

I don't follow, sorry.

If your system too noisy, fix the log level. But usually when UBIFS prints
an error followed by a stack trace, it is something serious you should address
and not trying to make the error message look less scary.
