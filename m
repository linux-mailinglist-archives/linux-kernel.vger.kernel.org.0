Locked together means the root of the new mount tree doesn't have
MNT_LOCKED set, but all mounts below do have MNT_LOCKED, right?

Isn't the bug here that the root mount gets MNT_LOCKED as well?

Well, it's called anonymous namespace.  So there *is* an mnt_ns, and
its lifetime is bound to the file returned by fsmount().
