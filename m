Hi Chris,

This is a rather hasty email as I'm at a conference right now, but I
wanted to convey that I'm not opposed to making sure that the NTP
records obey the audit configuration (that was the original intent
after all), I think it is just that we are all a little confused as to
why you are seeing the NTP records *and*only* the NTP records.

It's been a while, but I thought we suggested Dave try running
'auditctl -a never,task' to see if that would solve his problem and I
believe his answer was no, which confused me a bit as the
audit_filter_task() call in audit_alloc() should see that rule and
return a state of AUDIT_DISABLED which not only prevents audit_alloc()
from allocating an audit_context (and remember if the audit_context is
NULL then audit_dummy_context() returns true), but it also clears the
TIF_SYSCALL_AUDIT flag (which I'm guessing you also want).

Can you confirm the results of 'auditctl -a never,task' on your systems?
