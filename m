Hmm, yes I was hoping one could hide that behind the dma_pfn_t and the 
interface, so that non-trivial backends would be able to define the 
dma_pfn_t as needed and also if needed have their own special 
implementation of the interface functions. The interface was spec'ed 
from the user's (TTM) point of view assuming that with a page-prot and 
an opaque dma_pfn_t we'd be able to support most non-trivial backends, 
but that's perhaps not the case?

For VMware we only care about x86 and arm64, but i think Christian needs 
to fill in here.

Thanks,
