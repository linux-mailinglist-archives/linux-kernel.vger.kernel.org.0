No good reason - it seems like a conceptually different sort of flag so
I vaguely felt that it would help if it were numerically separate.

If we are going to use a spinlock, I'd much rather not add a flag bit,
but instead use the blocked_member list_head.

I'm almost tempted to suggest adding
  smp_list_del_init_release() and smp_list_empty_careful_acquire()
so that list membership can be used as a barrier.  I'm not sure I game
though.
