Ok. Apologies for earlier confusion.

So the kzalloc/memset fix you sent for f_fs.c does seem to avoid the
crash on bootup I was seeing w/  HiKey/dwc2 (previously I had only
tested it on HiKey960/dwc3).

However with that patch, I still see tranfer problems with adb, unless
I comment out setting sg_supported in dwc2/gadget.c (in the same
fashion I have to with HiKey960/dwc3).

The dwc2 zlp patch doesn't seem to affect things much either way in my
testing. But maybe I'm just not tripping on that issue yet.

So yes, the kzalloc/memset patch is a clear improvement, as it avoids
the bootup crash on dwc2, and seems like it should go in.

However, there is still the outstanding issue w/  functionfs sg
support stalling on larger transfers.
