Is there any objection from anybody to applying the first two patches, the 
reverts of the reverts that went into 5.3-rc5, for 5.3 and pursuing 
discussion and development using the last two patches in this series as a 
starting point for a sane allocation policy that just works by default for 
everybody?

Andrea acknowledges the swap storm that he reported would be fixed with 
the last two patches in this series and there has been discussion on how 
they can be extended at the same time that they do not impact allocations 
outside the scope of the discussion here (hugetlb).
