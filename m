Yes. Every port (or maybe I should say "connector") should always have
its own ACPI/DT node.

There should also be a separate parent node for the port nodes that
represents the USB Type-C controller part (in EC), meaning you
probable don't want to simply make the port nodes child nodes directly
under the root EC node (the one that has ACPI HID GOOG0004 or
GOOG0008). The controller node is the one that is child of the root EC
node, and the port nodes are children of the controller. The
controller node ideally will have its own ACPI HID, but the port nodes
themselves don't need HIDs. I guess this part is clear..

I proposed in my review (patch 3/3) that there should be actually a
single parent controller node for every port, so that you would have
always a controller node with a single port node for every connector,
but that may be overkill. I was thinking about past problems where it
is no clear which port (number) should be mapped to which port node,
but you do not have that problem.

So I think you only need a single "EC Type-C Controller" node that
is the parent for the port nodes.

I'll put here a short ASL example snippet that has nodes for two
ports, that hopefully helps explain how I think this should be
described in the ACPI tables:

DefinitionBlock ("usbc.aml", "SSDT", 5, "GOOGLE", "USBC", 1)
{
    /* I'm assuming here that H_EC is the EC device. */
    Scope (\_SB.H_EC)
    {
        /*
         * This is the controller (port parent) device that communicates with
         * the EC. It is the node that would create the device instance for the
         * driver (drivers/platform/chrome/cros_ec_typec.c).
         */
        Device (USBC)
        {
            Name (_HID, "GOOGXXXX") /* FIXME!!!!!! */
            Name (_DDN, "ChromeOS Embedded Controller USB Type-C Control")

            /*
             * Each connector shall have its own ACPI device entry (node),
             * under the actual interface (controller) device.
             */
            Device (CON1)
            {
                /* Port number 1 */
                Name (_ADR, One)

                /* The port capability device properties. */
                Name (_DSD, Package () {
                    ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
                    Package() {
                        Package () {"power-role", "dual"},
                        Package () {"data-role", "dual"},
                    },
                })
            }

            Device (CON2)
            {
                /* Port number 2 */
                Name (_ADR, Two)

                Name (_DSD, Package () {
                    ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
                    Package() {
                        Package () {"power-role", "dual"},
                        Package () {"data-role", "dual"},
                    },
                })
            }
        }
    }
}

To play it safe (and be compatible with DT), the port number does not
have to be the node address (_ADR). You can get the port number also
from a device property as well of course.
