Right, AFAIR PaulT suggested to add support for the concept of a task
being "latency tolerant": meaning we can spend more time to search for
a CPU and/or avoid preempting the current task.

I like the idea of biasing, especially considering we are still in the
domain of the FAIR scheduler. If something more mandatory should be
required there are other classes which are likely more appropriate.

Just to be sure, you are not proposing to use the nice value we
already have, i.e.
  p->{static,normal}_prio
but instead a new similar concept, right?

Otherwise, pros would be we don't touch userspace, but as a cons we
would have side effects, i.e. bandwidth allocation.
While I think we don't want to mix "specific behaviors" with "biases".

I think we currently have a single system-wide parameter for that now:

   sched_wakeup_granularity_ns ==> sysctl_sched_min_granularity

which is used in:

   wakeup_gran()                for the wakeup path
   check_preempt_tick()         for the periodic tick

that's where it should be possible to extend the heuristics with some
biasing based on the latency-nice attribute of a task, right?

That will be very useful for the Android case too.
In Android we used to call it "prefer_idle", but that's probably not
the best name, conceptually similar however.

In Android we would use a latency-nice concept to go for either the
fast (select_idle_siblings) or the slow (energy aware) path.

> Hmmm?

Just one more requirement I think it's worth to consider since the
beginning: CGroups support

That would be very welcome interface. Just because is so much more
convenient (and safe) to set these bias on a group of tasks depending
on their role in the system.

Do you have any idea on how we can expose such a "lantency-nice"
property via CGroups? It's very similar to cpu.shares but it does not
represent a resource which can be partitioned.

Best,
Patrick
