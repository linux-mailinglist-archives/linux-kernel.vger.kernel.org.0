The patch

   regulator: da9063: Fix get_mode() functions to read sleep field

has been applied to the regulator tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regulator.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: da9063: Fix get_mode() functions to read sleep
 field

get_mode() is used to retrieve the active mode state. Settings-A
config is used during active state, whilst Settings-B is for
suspend. This means we only need to check the sleep field of each
buck and LDO as that field solely relates to Settings-A config.

This change is a clone of the get_mode() update which was committed
as part of:
 - regulator: da9062: fix suspend_enable/disable preparation
   [a72865f057820ea9f57597915da4b651d65eb92f]
