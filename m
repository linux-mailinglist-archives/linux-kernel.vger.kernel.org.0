Stack allocations can no longer be dynamically sized in the kernel,
so that would not work.

What I noticed though is that the largest part of safexcel_ahash_export_state
is used in the 'cache' member, and this is apparently only referenced inside of
safexcel_hmac_init_iv, which you call twice. If that cache can be allocated
only once, you save SHA512_BLOCK_SIZE bytes in one of the two paths.

I count 484 bytes for it, which is really large.

Right, this is what I noticed there. With 480 of the 484 bytes gone,
you are well below the warning limit even without the other change.
