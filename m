I thought that was the whole point of the
rcu_read_unlock_special.b.deferred_qs bit that was introduced in
23634ebc1d94. We are checking that bit in the "else if" here as well. So this
should be no less immune to scheduler deadlocks any more than the preceding
"else if" where we are checking this bit.

Yes, I should delete this #2 from the changelog since it is not very relevant
(I feel now). My point with #2 was that even if were to raise a softirq
(which we are not), a scheduler wakeup of ksoftirqd is impossible in this
path anyway since in_irq() implies in_interrupt().
