What would be nice is to have a NMI_IRET, that is defined as something
that wont break legacy CPUs. Where it could be just a nop iret, or maybe
if possible a "lock iret"? That is, not have a IRET_NON_NMI, as that
would be all over the place, but just the iret for NMI itself. As
that's in one place.
