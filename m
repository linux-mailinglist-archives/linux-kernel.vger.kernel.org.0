I am generally confused by this driver. How does it work exactly? What
happens after altera-cvp binds a PCI device?

You can use it to download a bitstream (say we had the debugfs
interface), and then what happens next? How do I use the device? It
already has a PCI driver bound to it at that point?

What happens next?

Please tell me that not the only use-case for this is /dev/mem :)

Thomas' use-case is different in that behind the FPGA device there are
actual other *discoverable* PCI devices that will get enumerated and
bind to separate drivers.

Thanks,
Moritz
