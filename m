For that we have PTE_DEVMAP on arm64 which differentiates device memory
entries from others and it should not again need PTE_SPECIAL as well for
that. We set both bits while creating the entries with pte_mkdevmap()
and check just one bit PTE_DEVMAP with pte_devmap(). Problem is it will
also test positive for pte_special() and risks being identified as one.

That is altogether a different aspect which is handled with vmem_altmap
during hotplug and nothing to do with how device memory is mapped in the
page table. I am not sure about "none" though. IIUC unlike traditional
device pfn all ZONE_DEVICE memory will have struct page backing either
on system RAM or in the device memory itself.

If this is the only path for which all platforms have to set PTE_SPECIAL
in their device mapping, then it should just be fixed in vm_normal_page().

Probably something to be asked in the mm community.

1. Why pte_mkdevmap() should set SPECIAL bit for a positive pte_special()
   check. Why the same mapping be identified as pte_devmap() as well as
   pte_special().

2. Can pte_devmap() and pte_special() re-ordering at vm_normal_page() will
   remove this dependency or there are other commons MM paths which assume
   this behavior ?
