If all clks are in the same file then it sounds fine to just use clk_hw
pointers everywhere.

Sure. The plan is to get rid of the array of string names to specify
parents. We can debate the size and cost associated with moving away
from that, but it won't change the overall message here that I'd like to
see new drivers use the new way of specifying parents instead of using
strings for topology description.
