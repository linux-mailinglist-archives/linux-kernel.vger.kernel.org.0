Lawsuits take money and alot of time, Jeff. No suit has yet been filed: 
why do you decree that an issue that is only a few months old is 
"settled"? You may have noticed that the Geek Feminists, as far as I 
know, have not chosen to re-post the work of authorship in question, nor 
do they, as far as I know, distribute it at all, post-revocation. Tell 
me, Jeff, what would they be sued for? Their license was revoked and 
they have not chosen to redistribute the work or make derivatives 
post-revocation.

There was no "attempt": the license _was_ revoked.
It seems you are ignorant of property law, Jeff, along with licensing 
and the differences between licenses and license contracts.
