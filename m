It prints a memory address for an indexed operand.

If you write just "%0" it prints addresses that are a single register
as "0(r3)" instead of "0,r3".  Some instructions do not allow offset
form.

It seems to use *(u8 *)addr as rvalue.  Asm operands are lvalues.  It
matters a lot for memory operands.
