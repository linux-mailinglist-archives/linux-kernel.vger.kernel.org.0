I assume we're referring to stuff such as the following?

https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg730329.html

Are these breakages limited to the out-of-line hacks made for LL/SC
atomics, or were there other breakages elsewhere?

Now that the out-of-line hacks have gone, I wonder if this is actually
still a problem anymore. In any case isn't the right thing to do there
to add the __always_inline to functions that use the register keyword
in a function currently annotated inline?

I'm happy to look into this if there is likely to be some benefit in
turning on CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING.

Thanks,

Andrew Murray
