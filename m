Hi Cyril

Indeed.  simply compare with zero might be better.

Looks correct. But if we set a ULONG_MAX(PR_GET_TIMERSLACK also limits ULONG_MAX)
value(about 4s) on 32bit machine, this code will think this value is a negative value and use default value.

I guess man page was written as "less than or equal to zero" because of this confusing code(arg2<=0, but arg2
is an unsinged long value).
I think we can change this man page and also add bounds value description.

Also, I found a patch about arg2 is an unsigned long value

commit 7fe5e04292e71af34ae171b88caa2a139e0b6125

     sys_prctl(): arg2 is unsigned long which is never<  0

     arg2 will never<  0, for its type is 'unsigned long'

     Also, use the provided macros.

What do you think about it ?
