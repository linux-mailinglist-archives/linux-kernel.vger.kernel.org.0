Allocating buffers from a special heap is what I expected the
interface to be. The issue is that if we specify the secure mode any
time later on, then it could be changed. E.g. with Daniel Stone's idea
of a handle2fd flag, you could export the buffer twice, once secure,
once non-secure. That sounds like a silly thing to me, and better to
prevent that - or is this actually possible/wanted, i.e. do we want to
change the secure mode for a buffer later on?

If we allocate a secure buffer there's no need for flags anymore I
think - it would be a property of the underlying buffer (like a
contiguous buffer). All we need are two things:
- make sure secure buffers can only be imported by secure-buffer aware drivers
- some way for such drivers to figure out whether they deal with a
secure buffer or not.

There's no need for any flags anywhere else with the ion/secure
dma-buf heap solution. E.g. for contig buffer we also dont pass around
a DRM_FORMAT_MOD_PHYSICALLY_CONTIG for addfb2.

dumb is dumb, this definitely feels like the wrong interface to me.

Why does userspace need to communicate this again? What's the issue
with using an ARM specific allocator for this?
