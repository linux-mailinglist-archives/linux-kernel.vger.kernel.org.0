Subject: [PATCH] doc: replace IFF abbreviation  with 'if and only if'
Date:   Sat,  7 Sep 2019 12:51:16 +0200
Message-Id: <20190907105116.19183-1-federico.vaga@vaga.pv.it>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In a normal piece of text the use of 'iff' does not guarantee a correct
interpretation because it is easy to confuse it for a typo (if or iff?).

I believe that IFF should not be used outside a logical/mathematical
expression. For this reason with this patch I am replacing 'iff' with
'if an only if' in text, and I am leaving it as it is in logical formulae.
