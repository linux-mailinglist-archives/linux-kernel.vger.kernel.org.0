Agreed about your above, but specific this the problem in this patch
There should be other ways.

First thought about doing generic handling in swiotlb part, and do
something like kdump_memory_reserve(size) Ingo suggested,  but according
to you swiotlb init is late, so it can not increase the size, OTOH if
reserve another region for kdump in swiotlb will cause other issues. 

So let's think about other improvement, for example to see if you can
call kdump_memory_reserve(size) in AMD SME init path, for example in
mem_encrypt_init(), is it before crashkernel reservation? 

If doable it will be at least cleaner than the code in this patch.

Thanks
Dave
