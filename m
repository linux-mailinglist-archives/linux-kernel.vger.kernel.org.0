Hi, Vlastimil

Thanks for your comment.

I just found there could be some refine for the code and then I modify and
test it. Hope this could help a little.

You concern is valid. The benefits / cost may be not that impressive. The
community have the final decision. For me, I just want to make it better if we
can.
