Interesting use case.

First, to clarify my TODO: I was initially thinking of the recursive
"up-heritance" of suppliers from child to parent to handle cases where
the supplier is a device from some other top level device (or its
child). My thinking has evolved a bit on that. I think the parent
needs to inherit only from it's immediate children and not its
grandchildren (the child is responsible for handling grandchildren
suppliers). I'll also have to make sure I don't try to create a link
from a parent device to one of its child device nodes (should be easy
to check).

Anyway, going back to your case, for dependencies between child nodes
of a parent, can't the parent just populate them in the right order?
You can loop through the children and add them in multiple stages.

I'll continue to think if I can come up with anything nicer on the
drivers, but even if we can't come up with anything better, we can
still make sync_state() work.

Cheers,
Saravana
