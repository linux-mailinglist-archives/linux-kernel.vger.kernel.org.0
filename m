Hmm... :/

Those mappings just set Stream ID == PCI RID (strictly each one should 
only need to cover the bus range assigned to that bridge, but it's not 
crucial) which is the same thing the driver assumes for the mmu-masters 
property, so either that's wrong and never could have worked anyway - 
have you tried VFIO on this platform? - or there are other devices also 
mastering through the SMMU that aren't described at all. Are you able to 
capture a boot log? The SMMU faults do encode information about the 
offending ID, and you can typically correlate their appearance 
reasonably well with endpoint drivers probing.
