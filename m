I believe you're right and I'd overlooked this. I think there is a
more efficient version of this code possible that I can follow up
with. There are 3 perf_event_contexts, potentially a sw and hw context
within the task_struct and one per-CPU in perf_cpu_context. With this
change I'm focussed on improving rotation of cgroup events that appear
system wide within the per-CPU context. Without cgroup events the
system wide events don't need to be iterated over during scheduling
in. The branch that can set rotate_necessary will only be necessary
for the task hardware events. For system wide events, considered with
cgroup mode scheduling in, the branch is necessary as rotation may be
necessary. It'd be possible to have variants of flexible_sched_in that
behave differently in the task software event context, and the system
wide and task hardware contexts.

I have a series of patches related to Kan Liang's cgroup
perf_event_groups improvements. I'll mail these out and see if I can
avoid the branch in the task software event context case.

Thanks,
Ian
