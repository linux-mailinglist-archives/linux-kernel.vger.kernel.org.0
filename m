Yeah, I can second that. I remember using the suite and it pointed to
real issues when I was touching the area in the past. So if we can get
as many tests to be independent on the library and integrate it to some
existing testing project - be it kernel selftest or LTP - then it would
be really great and I assume the testing coverage of the hugetlb
functionality would increase dramatically.
