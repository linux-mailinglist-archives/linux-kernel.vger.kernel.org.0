And they spell it "feature-test" there.  Lovely :-/

No, that is not what it does.  A user defines such a macro, and that
makes the library change behaviour.

As the GNU C Library manual explains:

     This system exists to allow the library to conform to multiple
  standards.  Although the different standards are often described as
  supersets of each other, they are usually incompatible because larger
  standards require functions with names that smaller ones reserve to the
  user program.  This is not mere pedantry -- it has been a problem in
  practice.  For instance, some non-GNU programs define functions named
  'getline' that have nothing to do with this library's 'getline'.  They
  would not be compilable if all features were enabled indiscriminately.
