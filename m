These things answer the question: "what stops rdt_domain_reconfigure_cdp() racing with
set_cache_qos_cfg() on the mount path, causing the wrong value to be restored?".

We can try and answer that in the commit message, or comments, but these will quickly be
lost, stale, or wrong.

These annotations serve as a comment, and let lockdep check its still true.
(I think you can never have enough lockdep annotations!)

Indeed, it splits up the, er, "big RDT mutex", these annotations mean lockdep catches me
out if I do something wrong, and makes it very clear when changing something subtle.

Ideally these things are there from the beginning. Adding them over time as part of other
reviewed patches works. I don't think adding them in one go before refactoring helps: you
wouldn't have the confidence that they were correct in the first place.

I'll drop these.

Sure,
