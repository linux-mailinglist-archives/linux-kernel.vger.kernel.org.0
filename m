Yes, it is indeed a disability, more on that below.

This is particularly something we want to avoid with this patch. We want
to make sure that we have the up-to-date status of the disability right
when it happens. i.e, a CPU without FP/SIMD is brought up. With SYSTEM_FEATURE
you have to wait until we bring all the CPUs up. Also, for HAS_FPSIMD,
you must wait until all the CPUs are up, unlike the negated capability.

True, it is not used for this particular case.
