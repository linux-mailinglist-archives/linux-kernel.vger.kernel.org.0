So I guess we want something like the change at the bottom.

The core soc clock driver gets initialized through CLK_OF_DECLARE(),
aka real early during boot. So if the kmemdup fails there can not be
any -EPROBE_DEFER, as there is no kernel-driver-model running yet.

All other components of the system of course depend on the clock-
controller being available, so that way the system can at least come
up further so that people might be able to debug their issue further.

The other option would be to panic, but the kernel should not
panic if other options are available - and continuing with a static
pll frequency is less invasive in the error case.
