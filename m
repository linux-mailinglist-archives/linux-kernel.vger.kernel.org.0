fearing  who can withdraw this money then use the funds for Charity
works. I WISH TO GIVE THIS FUNDS TO YOU FOR CHARITY WORKS. I found

willing and interested to handle these trust funds in good faith
before anything happens to me.
I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will
inherit this money after I die. I want your urgent reply to me so that
I will give you the deposit receipt which the  COMPANY issued to me as
next of kin for immediate transfer of the money to your account in
your country, to start the good work of God, I want you to use the
15/percent of the total amount to help yourself in doing the project.

I am desperately in keen need of assistance and I have summoned up
courage to contact you for this task, you must not fail me and the
millions of the poor people in our todays WORLD. This is no stolen
money and there are no dangers involved,100% RISK FREE with full legal
proof. Please if you would be able to use the funds for the Charity
works kindly let me know immediately.I will appreciate your utmost
confidentiality and trust in this matter to accomplish my heart
desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish. I
want you to take 15 percent of the total money for your personal use
while 85% of the money will go to charity.I will appreciate your
utmost confidentiality and trust in this matter to accomplish my heart
desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish.
