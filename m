I ran into this probem when running a test program that keeps on
allocating and touch memory and it eventually fails as the swap space is
full. After the failure, I could not rerun the test program again
because the swap space remained full. I finally track it down to the
fact that the mm stayed on as active_mm of kernel threads. I have to
make sure that all the idle cpus get a user task to run to bump the
dying mm off the active_mm of those cpus, but this is just a workaround,
not a solution to this problem.

It would be nice if there is a better solution.
