Yes, this is mostly for the devices already produced that are forced to suffer
with poor memory management. I can't even convince vendors to fix kernel
memory leaks, so there's no way I'd be able to convince them of trying this
patch, especially since it seems like you're having trouble convincing vendors
to stop using lowmemorykiller in the first place. And thankfully, convincing
vendors isn't my job :)

Could you elaborate a bit on why bulk killing isn't good?

Fair, though it was quite strange seeing something that was supposedly totally
abandoned receiving a large chunk of code for reporting stats.

Thanks,
