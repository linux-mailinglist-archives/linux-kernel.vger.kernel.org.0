Current soc framework is allowing the soc info drivers to create very 
limited
soc information as sysfs entries like machine name, family, revision and 
soc_id.
Sometimes it become a limited information for the clients to know more 
about soc
information. In this scenario soc info drivers are adding their own 
sysfs entries
on top of what soc framework is doing like hw_platform, 
hw_platform_subtype etc.
I believe this will be an issue for the other soc vendors as well. It is 
good that
if we could add these into the soc framework rather than individual 
clients defining
and adding them as per their requirement.
