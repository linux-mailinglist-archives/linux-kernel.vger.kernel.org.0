Ok, I see that change in 8341f2f222d729688014ce8306727fdb9798d37e.  I 
hadn't tested it any other way before.  Using the null pointer 
de-reference module code at [1] a pstore record is generated as expected 
when the module is loaded (panic_on_oops=1).

I have also tested swapping the kmsg_dump() / 
atomic_notifier_call_chain() around in panic.c and this also results in 
a pstore record being created with sysrq-c.  I don't know if that would 
be an acceptable solution though since it may break behaviour that other 
things depend on.
