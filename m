Hi everyone,

This is series is the first part of a large series (I haven't done the
rest) of patches to rewrite the clk parent relationship handling within
the sunxi-ng clk driver. This is based on Stephen's recent work allowing
clk drivers to specify clk parents using struct clk_hw * or parsing DT
phandles in the clk node.

This series can be split into a few major parts:

1) The first patch is a small fix for clk debugfs representation. This
   was done before commit 1a079560b145 ("clk: Cache core in 
   clk_fetch_parent_index() without names") was posted, so it might or
   might not be needed. Found this when checking my work using
   clk_possible_parents.

2) A bunch of CLK_HW_INIT_* helper macros are added. These cover the
   situations I encountered, or assume I will encounter, such as single
   internal (struct clk_hw *) parent, single DT (struct clk_parent_data
   .fw_name), multiple internal parents, and multiple mixed (internal +
   DT) parents. A special variant for just an internal single parent is
   added, CLK_HW_INIT_HWS, which lets the driver share the singular
   list, instead of having the compiler create a compound literal every
   time. It might even make sense to only keep this variant.

3) A bunch of CLK_FIXED_FACTOR_* helper macros are added. The rationale
   is the same as the single parent CLK_HW_INIT_* helpers.

4) Bulk conversion of CLK_FIXED_FACTOR to use local parent references,
   either struct clk_hw * or DT .fw_name types, whichever the hardware
   requires.

5) The beginning of SUNXI_CCU_GATE conversion to local parent
   references. This part is not done. They are included as justification
   and examples for the shared list of clk parents case.

I realize this is going to be many patches every time I convert a clock
type. Going forward would the people involved prefer I send out
individual patches like this series, or squash them all together?

Stephen, would it make sense for you to pick up the first 7 patches that
touch the clk core? And then we can base our clk branch on top of those?


Thanks
ChenYu
