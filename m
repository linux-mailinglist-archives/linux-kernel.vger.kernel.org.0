Not really. A level/edge mismatch isn't something you can spot that
quickly, but will cause lost interrupts on load. Since the kernel can
spot the error pretty much right away, I think that could even be a
pr_err :)

Ah returning an error will cause such splat indeed.

Haha, yeah, I don't like it going out of its way to validate them but
that sort of very obvious sanity checking makes sense.

This was Talel original approach internally in fact. I told him to put
it in the specifier instead :-) The advantage in doing it that way is
that you get the right flags in the descriptor by default iirc, so the
right value in /proc/interrupts etc... And it will continue working if
a future FIC loses that limitation.

That said, if you feel strongly about it, we can revert to putting a
global property in the FIC node itself. Let us know what you want.

Cheers,
Ben.
