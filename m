Maybe, but not that I know of.  If they do, this would be an excellent
time for them to let me know!

My guess is "no" because the real-time application would not yet be
running during boot.  On the other hand, if this issue is due not so much
to boot, but to (say) expensive filesystem operations on large systems,
that might be a different story.

Except that I would have hard questions to ask of someone doing expensive
filesystem operations while their deep-sub-millisecond real-time
application was running.  So even then, I doubt that they would care.

Again, if I am wrong about this, this would be an excellent time for
them to let me know.

Woo-hoo!!!

Very good.  I will get it property prepared and tested, then send it
along to Ingo.

Thank you in advance!  I just might take you up on that!

In the meantime, one question...  Are you testing for realtime suitability
on your big box?  If so, to what extent?

Aside from habitually failing to trim emails, which of these was I
violating?  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
