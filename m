Which kernel space core mechanisms? I can see memory reclaim, do you
envision some other component as well.

Let's discuss how this can interact with memory reclaim and we can see
if there is any benefit to do this in kernel.

Not sure about the LRU but yes read-ahead in several places does
assume spatial locality. However most of those are configurable and
the userspace can enable/disable the read-ahead based on the workload.

How will this work in the process context? Number of regions equal to
the number of mapped pages?

Basically I am trying to envision the comparison of physical memory
based monitoring (using idle page tracking) vs pid+VA based
monitoring.

Anyways I am not against your proposal. I am trying to see how to make
it more general to be applicable to more use-cases and one such
use-case which I am interested in is monitoring all the user pages on
the system for proactive reclaim purpose.
