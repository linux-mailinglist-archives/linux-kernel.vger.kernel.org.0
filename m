but your misfit task might not be the running one anymore when
load_balance effectively happens

I thought about this but task can have already die at that time and
the pointer is no more relevant.
Or we should parse the list of task still attached to the cpu and
compare them with the saved pointer but then it's not scalable and
will consume a lot of time

But you can easily select a task that is not misfit so what is the best/worst ?
select a fully wrong task or at least one of the real misfit tasks

I'm fine to go back and use load instead of util but it's not robust IMO.

why should we balance anything ? all tasks have already enough running time.
It's better to wait for a cpu to become idle instead of trying to
predict which one will be idle first and migrate task uselessly
because other tasks can easily wakeup in the meantime
