I hope that this patch will be pulled soon (before final cut) - for that
reason we can assume that the padding is ignored by the kernel and
hence do not explicitly clear it in glibc (as it was done in sent
patches)

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but this problem is related to x32
machines (and not to ARM 32 bit ones with Y2038).
