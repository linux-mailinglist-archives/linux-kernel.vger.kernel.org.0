Nothing special (other than the normal check if accesses overlap) done
with size in READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE.

When you say prune naturally aligned && __native_word() accesses, I
assume you mean _plain_ naturally aligned && __native_word(), right? I
think this is a slippery slope, because if we start pretending that
such plain accesses should be treated as atomics, then we will also
miss e.g. races where the accesses should actually have been protected
by a mutex.

Our plan here is to use some of the options in Kconfig.kcsan to limit
reported volume of races initially, at least for syzbot instances. But
of course, this will not make the real issue go away, and eventually
we'll have to deal with all reported races somehow.
