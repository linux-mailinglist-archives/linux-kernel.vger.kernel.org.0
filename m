Let's first take a step back, because I don't know how the HW busy
detection works for your controller.

I have noticed there is TMIO_STAT_CMD_BUSY bit being set for some
variants, which seems to cause renesas_sdhi_wait_idle() to loop for a
pre-defined number of loops/timeout. This looks scary, but I can't
tell if it's really a problem.

BTW, do you know what TMIO_STAT_CMD_BUSY actually is monitoring?

I have also noticed that MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY isn't set for any of
the renesas/tmio variant hosts. Is that simply because the HW doesn't
support this? Or because implementation is missing?

If you want to run a test that stretches the behaviour on the timeout
path, I would rather use an SD-card (the older the better). For eMMCs
the erase likely translates to a trim/discard, which is far more
quicker than a real erase - as is what happens on an old SD card.
