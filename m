I think I explained how the reference count of 1 is problematic when 
wanting to offline the memory. After all that's the problem I try to 
solve: Keep PG_offline set until the memory is offline and make sure 
nobody will touch the page.

See below on details on how to revive such unplugged memory.

Again, when onlining memory you have to assume the memmap is complete 
garbage. No trusting *at all* on that as of now. This represents a BIG 
change to what we have right now. Not totally against that, but it 
sounds like a bigger rework that mainly helps to fix HWPoison.

The driver let go of all direct references. The page (or rather chunks) 
are in no list. The "knowledge" that these pages are offline are stored 
in some external metadata. This metadata is updated when notified via 
the memory notifier.

What happens in case virtio-mem wants to revive a chunk (IOW, plug 
unplugged memory)?

a) it makes sure no concurrent memory onlining/offlining can happen 
(locking via memory notifiers)
b) it grabs a reference to the page (increasing the refcount)
c) it clears PG_offline and issues free_contig_range().

It's just complex stuff :) I guess the part you are missing is that the 
driver officially signals "I have no direct reference, you can offline 
this memory, I know how to deal with that". It's not like "this is a 
balloon inflated page I keep in a list".
