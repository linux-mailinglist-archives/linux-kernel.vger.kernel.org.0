Subject: [PATCH platform-next v3 06/11] Documentation/ABI: Add new attribute for mlxreg-io sysfs interfaces
Date:   Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:28:34 +0000

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add documentation for the new attributes for:
- Exposing reset causes types asserted by: platform reset, SoC reset,
  AC power failure, software power off request.
- Setting and removing system VPD (EEPROM) hardware write protection.
- Voltage regulator devices configuration update status and firmware
  version.
- Setting PCIe ASIC reset to disable or enable state during PCIe root
  complex reset.
- System static topology identification, like system's static I2C
  topology, number and type of FPGA devices within the system and so on.
