I think we are going in circles on this one. I acknowledge you have an
issue. That being said, I also understand the need to keep the pelt
framework code tight. Also Ionela pointed out that there could be a need
for a faster decay in which case it could mean a left shift leading to
further complications if defined in pelt.c (I am not saying that I will
implement a faster decay in this patch set but it is more of a future
extension if needed!)

I can make trigger_thermal_pressure_average inline if that will
alleviate some of the concerns.

I would also urge you to reconsider the merits of arguing this point
back and forth.
