Not saying it is specific to one or a few sets of resources.  The
proposal suggests handling every single consumer supplier relationship
for which the bootloader has enabled a supplier resource via an
explicit message communicating the enabled resources.  And directly
handling those exact resources.

Think about the definition of "paper over" vs "directly address".

OK, let me flesh out a possible implementation just a little bit.

This is focused on devicetree, as is your patch series.  For ACPI
a parallel implementation would exist.

The bootloader chosen property could be a list of tuples, each tuple
containing: consumer phandle, supplier phandle.  Each tuple could
contain more data if the implementation demands, but I'm trying to
keep it simple to illustrate the concept.

In early-ish boot a core function processes the chosen property.  For
each consumer / supplier pair, the supplier compatible could be used
to determine the supplier type.  (This might not be enough info to
determine the supplier type - maybe the consumer property that points
to the supplier will also have to be specified in the chosen property
tuple, or maybe a supplier type could be added to the tuple.)  Given
the consumer, supplier, and resource type the appropriate "get"
would be done.

Late in boot, and possible repeated after modules are loaded, a core
function would scan the chosen property tuples, and for each
consumer / supplier pair, if both the consumer and the supplier
drivers are bound, it would be ASSUMED that it is ok to do the
appropriate type of "put", and the "put" would be done.

No such assumption.

And same for the possible implementation I sketched above.  The equivalent
of the sync_state() callback would be done by the end of boot (potentially
repeated after each module loads) core function making a similar call.
Hand waving here about what suppliers to call.

Of course this is not the only way to implement my concept, just an
example to suggest that it might be feasible and it might work.
