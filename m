I think Daniel is still on vacation until next week or so.

I'd like to stuff this into drm.git somehow, I guess topic branch works
too.

Long term I think we need to reconsider how we handle fbdev, at least the
core/fbcon pieces. Since a few years all the work in that area has been
motivated by drm, and pushed by drm contributors. Having that maintained
in a separate tree that doesn't regularly integrate imo doesn't make much
sense, and we ended up merging almost everything through some drm tree.
That one time we didn't (for some panel rotation stuff) it resulted in
some good suprises.

I think best solution is if we put the core and fbcon bits into drm-misc,
as group maintained infrastructure piece. All the other gfx infra pieces
are maintained in there already too. You'd obviously get commit rights.
I think that would include
- drivers/video/fbdev
- drivers/video/*c
- drivers/video/console

I don't really care about what happens with the actual fbdev drivers
(aside from the drm one in drm_fb_helper.c, but that's already maintained
as part of drm). I guess we could also put those into drm-misc, or as a
separate tree, depending what you want.

Thoughts?

Cheers, Daniel
