Thanks for the link!
Announcement seems to be from March 2018 since then Cypress has
published detailed HyperBus protocol in public domain . Comparing JEDEC
xSPI specification and HyperBus protocol that Cypress has published,
they seem to be following 8D-8D-8D Profile 2.0 with Extended Command
Modifier of JEDEC xSPI spec.
Did you see anything missing/different?

I need to study xSPI spec in more detail, but seems like as long as we
support HyperBus Protocol spec from Cypress we should be safe.
