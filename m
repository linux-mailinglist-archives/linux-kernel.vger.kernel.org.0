Yeah, I found that too, there is no real design around
vmalloc_sync_all(). It looks like it was just added to fit the purpose
on x86-32. That also makes it hard to find all necessary call-sites.

Close, the underlying issue is not about PGD, but PMD entry
addition/removal on x86-32 pae systems.

The problem on x86-PAE arises from the !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD case, which was
introduced by the  Xen-PV patches and then re-used for the PTI-x32
enablement to be able to map the LDT into user-space at a fixed address.

Other architectures probably don't have the !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD case (or
do unsharing of kernel page-tables on any level where a huge-page could
be mapped).

Okay, as it stands, it promises to sync mappings for the vmalloc area
between all PGDs in the system. I will add that as a comment.

That would also cause needless overhead on x86-64 because the vmalloc
area doesn't need syncing there. I can make it x86-32 only, but that is
not a clean solution imo.

There is not enough address space on x86-32 to partition it like on
x86-64. In the default PAE configuration there are _four_ PGD entries,
usually one for the kernel, and then 512 PMD entries. Partitioning
happens on the PMD level, for example there is one entry (2MB of address
space) reserved for the user-space LDT mapping.
