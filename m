Just a stylistic thing since there's been a bit of back-and-forth on this
patch, but please can you fix your email client configuration so that the
replies are threaded properly? '=>' is non-standard and it's pretty
hard to spot in a mass of C code. You can look at
Documentation/process/email-clients.rst for some information about
configuring common clients.

Apologies if this comes across as pedantic, but it makes a surprising
difference in how easy it is to keep up with the thread (at least to me).
