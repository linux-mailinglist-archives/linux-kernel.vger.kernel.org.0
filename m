Hello everyone,

Please note that I am _in no way_ suggesting that we remove any code.

I just think it might be time to stop forcing CONFIG_SCSI_PROC_FS into
every config, and instead require one to explicitly request the aging
feature (which makes CONFIG_SCSI_PROC_FS show up in a defconfig).

Maybe we could add CONFIG_SCSI_PROC_FS to arch/x86/configs/foo ?
(For which foo? In a separate patch or squashed with this one?)

Regards.
