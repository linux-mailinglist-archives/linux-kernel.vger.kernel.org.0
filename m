But in this particular case we *do* adhere to the dma api, at least as 
far as we can. But we're missing functionality.

That sounds great. Is there anything I can do to help out? I thought 
this was more or less a dead end since the current dma_mmap_ API 
requires the mmap_sem to be held in write mode (modifying the 
vma->vm_flags) whereas fault() only offers read mode. But that would 
definitely work.

But I think that was what I was trying to initiate. The question was

"If it's the latter, then I would like to reiterate that it would be 
better that we work to come up with a long term plan to add what's 
missing to the DMA api to help graphics drivers use coherent memory?"

And since you NAK'd the original patches, I was sort of hoping for a 
point in the right direction.

Thanks,

Thomas
