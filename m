I'd say this is a hardware security vulnerability; no different from eg.
having no or faulty MMU, speculation that allows exfiltrating data, etc.
We did not understand the seriousness of lacking hardware sources of
randomness, but that's a common thing to many other security
vulnerabilities.

Machines that lack any sources of entropy have their uses, but they're akin
to processors with no MMU.  You should never run a world-accessible ssh
daemon on either of them.

It won't fix existing systems, and is irrelevant to deeply embedded, but
communicating this requirement to SoC designers sounds like a good idea to
me.  IoTrash appliance makers won't care but their security is already so
atrocious that lack of entropy is nowhere near the easiest way to get in,
while anyone else will at least notice the warning.

Any real-silicon hardware can include an entropy source, and if it doesn't,
shaming the maker is the way to go.  Calling the problem a security
vulnerability (which I say it is) sends a stronger message.
