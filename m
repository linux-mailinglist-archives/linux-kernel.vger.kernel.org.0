As Steve said that I said, they are synchronization points from the
viewpoint of code within the interrupted CPU.  Unless the architecture
code does as smp_mb() on interrupt entry and exit (which perhaps some
do, for all I know, maybe all of them do by now), memory accesses could
still be reordered across the interrupt from the perspective of other
CPUs and devices on the system.
