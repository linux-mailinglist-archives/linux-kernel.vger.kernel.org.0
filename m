Indeed I did, but I now see that it was via private email.  Here it is
again for public consumption, and Jiunn's patch is based on this one,
just translated to .rst.  I once again verified that the Jiunn's version
is word-for-word identical to mine, so Jiunn's patch should be good.  ;-)

    doc: RCU callback locks need only _bh, not necessarily _irq
    
    The UP.txt file calls for locks acquired within RCU callback functions
    to use _irq variants (spin_lock_irqsave() or similar), which does work,
    but can be overkill.  This commit therefore instead calls for _bh variants
    (spin_lock_bh() or similar), while noting that _irq does work.

 Answer to Quick Quiz #2:
 	What locking restriction must RCU callbacks respect?
 
-	Any lock that is acquired within an RCU callback must be
-	acquired elsewhere using an _irq variant of the spinlock
-	primitive.  For example, if "mylock" is acquired by an
-	RCU callback, then a process-context acquisition of this
-	lock must use something like spin_lock_irqsave() to
-	acquire the lock.

+	For example, if "mylock" is acquired by an RCU callback, then
+	a process-context acquisition of this lock must use something

 	If the process-context code were to simply use spin_lock(),
 	then, since RCU callbacks can be invoked from softirq context,
