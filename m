Hi, James,
OK. Thank you for your fix.

> Also do you think jitter should be enabled by default? I thought that it might make the data less precise, so I removed it here.

Since the interval for sampling without "jitter" is fixed (default 1024 on our server), I was worried that not adding it would result in the same result for each record, and some instructions could not be collected each time.

However, after many tests, it is not clear from the results that there is a significant difference between them (enable it or not).

So I am confused, whether to enable it or not.

Thanks.
Xiaojun.
