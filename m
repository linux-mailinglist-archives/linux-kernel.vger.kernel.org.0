Just to be clear, my main concern here is not using the devfreq framework.

It's rather whether switching speed modes is really worth it, which
Doug pointed out as well.

At some point you want to trigger the clock to be scaled up/down,
probably because of reaching some bandwidth threshold. This part seems
like a generic block thing and not an mmc specific thing.

Exactly how that would affect this approach is hard to say, but my
point is, that I don't want to sprinkle the mmc subsystem with code
that may belong in upper common layers.

Right.

It seems to me, that you are optimizing for only one particular use
case. How do you make sure to not increase energy consumption, for
other use cases that would gain from running at the highest speed mode
and "race to idle"?

I think you need to take a step back and think more general about this
approach. More importantly, you need to provide more data to prove
your approach, also according to suggestions from Dough.

Besides my comments above, Doug has provided you with valuable
feedback. Please follow up on that as well, if you still intend to
pursue with this approach.
