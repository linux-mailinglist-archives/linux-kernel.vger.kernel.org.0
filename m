No argument about that.

Kinda :)

That has pretty much the same problem as just storing the CLOCK_REALTIME
start time at fork and additionally it is wreckaged vs. suspend resume.

So a CLOCK_REALTIME time stamp at fork would at least be correct
vs. suspend resume.

The same result is achieved by:

       boot = ktime_get_boot_ns();
       delta = boot = tsk->real_start_time;

Typing real_start_time makes me really cringe.

Thanks,
