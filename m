Hi Paul.

The original "(libunwind or a recent version of libdw)" text was from Feb 2016.   So a while ago.

bd0419e2a5a9f requires >= 0.157 but this is for probing.  0a4f2b6a3ba50 specifies >= 0.158 but I see no mention of 
why in the commit but since it's from 2014 and elfutils is now at 0.178,  I think it's safe to just remove the 
reference.

As an aside, there is a lot of detail in perf-config.txt that's available in some of the other subcomands help files.
Seems a good way for things to get stale.   It could also do with some grammatical cleanup.

Tony
