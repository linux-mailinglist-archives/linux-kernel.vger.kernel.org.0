I already gave the IRQ example. But if that's not good I replied to
other emails with a clock providers example that's based on real
hardware.

Aren't you talking about the supplier here? I don't see any issues so far.

You could have consumers that try to use both the features of this IP
you mention (although I'm hard pressed to see how a watchdog is a
mandatory dependency but let's assume it is). So lets say consumer A
adds depends-on to your IP block for the clock and consumer B adds
depends-on your IP block for the watchdog.

If your driver is incomplete and provides only the watchdog feature,
then consumer A and B will attempt to probe once your device probes,
but consumer A will never probe successfully because it'll keep
getting -EPROBE_DEFER or an error. Your driver will never get a
sync_state() callback and that's fine because you don't know how to
use or turn off the clock source.

If the situation is reversed and your driver provides only the clock
feature, then consumer B will never probe because it'll never be able
to "get()" or whatever it tries to do with the watchdog feature. And
your driver will never get a sync_state() callback and you can never
turn off your clock. But that's the best you'll get till you send a
patch to add the watchdog support to your driver :)

We can't depend on the drivers to notify the core framework because
that doesn't work on a system with modules. The example I gave in the
commit text for the last patch is a good one. If your driver is
supplying power to the screen backlight and the backlight module is
never loaded, you can never turn off the supply to the backlight ever.
That use case has to work and it won't work if you depend on the
backlight driver to tell you what it depends on.
