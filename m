In previous patches, there is no time limit (max time is 0 which means no
time limit).

Andy Lutomirski proposed to set the time limit:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/26/735

"So I propose setting the timeout to either 100 microseconds or 100k
"cycles" by default.  In the event someone determines that they save
materially more power or gets materially better performance with a
longer timeout, we can revisit the value."

Does it make sense?

There may be other places to use the instructions. But I think this
patch set just first enables basic functionalities. We can focus on how to
use the instructions in the future.

Thanks.
