Right, but we don't make that assumption. Clusters are reported as
sockets/packages for arm, just like they are for arm64. My comment above
applied to what can be described using DT, not what systems actually
exists. We need to be able describe packages for architecture where we
can't make assumptions.

arm example (ARM TC2):
root@morras01-tc2:~# lstopo
Machine (985MB)
  Package L#0
    Core L#0 + PU L#0 (P#0)
    Core L#1 + PU L#1 (P#1)
  Package L#1
    Core L#2 + PU L#2 (P#2)
    Core L#3 + PU L#3 (P#3)
    Core L#4 + PU L#4 (P#4)
