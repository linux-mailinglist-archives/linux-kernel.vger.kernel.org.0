Yes, removing this special casing is reasonable. I am not sure
MAX_NR_ZONES - 1 is a better choice though. It is error prone and
zone_idx is the highest zone we should consider and MAX_NR_ZONES - 1
be ZONE_DEVICE if it is configured. But ZONE_DEVICE is really standing
outside of MM reclaim code AFAIK. It would be probably better to have
MAX_LRU_ZONE (equal to MOVABLE) and use it instead.
