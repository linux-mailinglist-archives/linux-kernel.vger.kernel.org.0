Sure, it's up to you where you place the test (if you plan to write it).

BTW I see evmtest [1] haven't been merged yet into ima-evm-utils.
What's blocking to merge them? (My objections to require bash shouldn't be the
reason for not being merged.)
I'd like to package them separately for developers to run them on SUT
(unless they're meant to be running only during building package).

Kind regards,
Petr
