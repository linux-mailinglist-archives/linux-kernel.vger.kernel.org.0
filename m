What happens when the older kernel is a kernel that parses
'depends-on'? What's 'older' is a moving target. We just need a
'depends-on-v5.2', 'depends-on-v5.3', etc.

It's not just 'old' kernels. Current kernels which didn't enable some
driver also have the same problem. All of this is mostly just a
development problem on incomplete platforms. But it is a real problem
that SUSE folks have raised.

That aspect, yes. It was Greg that said the late_initcall_sync abuses
were not the issue. 'depends-on' is the only thing I'm objecting to
ATM and I understand the problem (you're not the first to try). I've
not studied the the details of the patchset though beyond that.

Thinking of the above example I gave, the problem is mandatory or not
can't be decided in the DT. It's a function of what the kernel
supports or not, so the kernel has to decide. With a 'depends-on'
property, the value you'd want depends on which kernel do you boot. If
I'm booting a kernel with the pinctrl driver, then pinctrl is a
mandatory dependency. If I'm booting a kernel without the pinctrl
driver, then pinctrl is not a 'depends-on' dependency. Ignoring
dependencies like this case only works when things are built-in and
only for specific subsystems where it makes sense. It would be nice to
solve it for modules too, but that can be done later.

There's also the case of dependencies where the driver decides how to
handle them. For example, UARTs will use DMA if the dmaengine driver
is available and that decision is (at least for some drivers I've
looked at) made on every open(). I suppose in that case, the driver
could remove the dependency link since it knows it can work with or
without DMA, though we'd need some sort of mechanism to do that.

Yes, that's unfortunate. GPIO is the same. You can safely assume that
'-supply' is a regulator. This is at least somewhat enforced by the
binding schema now.

We probably need a for_each_of_property_with_suffix() iterator for
these cases and with some pointer math on the property names or a
custom str compare function, it shouldn't be much slower to match.

Okay, that's good.

I understand this. I think I was clear on my opinion about using
late_initcall_sync.
