ATS with the SMMU works like this:

* The PCI function sends a Translation Request with PASID.
* The SMMU walks the PASID table (which we call context descriptor
table), finds the context descriptor indexed by PASID. This context
descriptor has an ASID field, and a page directory pointer.
* After successfully walking the page tables, the SMMU may add an IOTLB
entry tagged by ASID and address, then returns a Translation Completion.
* The PCI function adds an ATC entry tagged by PASID and address.

I think the ASID on Arm CPUs is roughly equivalent to Intel PCID. One
reason we use ASIDs for IOTLBs is that with SVA, the ASID of an address
space is the same on the CPU side. And when the CPU executes a TLB
invalidation instructions, it also invalidates the corresponding IOTLB
entries. It's nice for vSVA because you don't need to context-switch to
the host to send an IOTLB invalidation. But only non-PCI devices that
implement SVA benefit from this at the moment, because ATC invalidations
still have to go through the SMMU command queue.

Thanks,
Jean
