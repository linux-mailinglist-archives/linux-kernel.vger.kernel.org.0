yes we don't need those files to build userspace stuff. The idea was 
that these format definitions establish a contract between userspace 
(more specifically the files stored in /lib/firmware) and the kernel. 
IIRC we wanted to make sure that any changes would be tracked as 
breaking userspace. If the consensus is that the uapi directory is 
strictly used for builds then we should indeed move those files
