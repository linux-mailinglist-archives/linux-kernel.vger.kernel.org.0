Ok, thanks for the suggestion.

For arm64 and x86, there are two versions of cpumask_of_node().

when CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS is defined, the cpumask_of_node()
   in arch/x86/mm/numa.c is used, which does partial node id checking:

const struct cpumask *cpumask_of_node(int node)
{
        if (node >= nr_node_ids) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING
                        "cpumask_of_node(%d): node > nr_node_ids(%u)\n",
                        node, nr_node_ids);
                dump_stack();
                return cpu_none_mask;
        }
        if (node_to_cpumask_map[node] == NULL) {
                printk(KERN_WARNING
                        "cpumask_of_node(%d): no node_to_cpumask_map!\n",
                        node);
                dump_stack();
                return cpu_online_mask;
        }
        return node_to_cpumask_map[node];
}

when CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS is undefined, the cpumask_of_node()
   in arch/x86/include/asm/topology.h is used:

static inline const struct cpumask *cpumask_of_node(int node)
{
        return node_to_cpumask_map[node];
}

As discussion in [1], adding the checking in cpumask_of_node() with
CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS not defined increases overhead for everyone,
and it is already true that cpumask_of_node() requires a valid node_id.

So maybe the overhead is worth it?

Hi, Peter
	Does the argument in this thread about making cpumask_of_node()
NUMA_NO_NODE aware make sense to you?
