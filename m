Mostly secure heaps, but there have been work in the past with
specially aligned chunk heaps in the past. Unfortunately since every
vendor tree also include many of their own hacks to the core ION code
(usually without changelogs or comments) its hard to decipher much of
it.

Some examples:
msm:
https://github.com/Panchajanya1999/msm-4.14/blob/Pie/drivers/staging/android/ion/ion_cma_secure_heap.c

exynos:
https://github.com/exynos-linux-stable/starlte/tree/tw90-android-p/drivers/staging/android/ion/exynos

hisi:
https://github.com/hexdebug/android_kernel_huawei_hi3660/blob/master/drivers/staging/android/ion/ion_seccm_heap.c
https://github.com/hexdebug/android_kernel_huawei_hi3660/blob/master/drivers/staging/android/ion/ion_secsg_heap.c
https://github.com/hexdebug/android_kernel_huawei_hi3660/blob/master/drivers/staging/android/ion/ion_fama_misc_heap.c

mediatek:
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/+/android-mtk-3.18/drivers/staging/android/ion/mtk/ion_mm_heap.c

But Andrew's example is probably a better example against the dmabuf
heaps frameworks

I'm still not understanding how this would work. Benjamin and Laura
already commented on this point, but for a simple example, with the
HiKey boards, the DRM driver requires contiguous memory for the
framebuffer, but the GPU can handle non-contiguous. Thus the target
framebuffers that we pass to the display has to be CMA allocated, but
all the other graphics buffers that the GPU will render to and
composite can be system.

Having the separate heaps allows the gralloc code to allocate the
proper buffer depending on the planned usage (GRALLOC_USAGE_HW_FB or
not), and that way we don't waste CMA on buffers that don't have to be
contiguous.

Laura already touched on this, but similar logic can be used for
camera buffers, which can make sure we allocate from a specifically
reserved CMA region that is only used for the camera so we can always
be sure to have N free buffers immediately to capture with, etc.

But let me know if I'm still misunderstanding your suggestion.
