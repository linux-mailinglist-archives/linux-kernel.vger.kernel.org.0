I don't think this description really explains the contention argument
well.  There are _more_ PMD locks than there are i_mmap_sem locks, so
processes accessing different parts of the same file can work in parallel.

Are there other current users of the write lock that could use a read lock?
At first blush, it would seem that unmap_ref_private() also only needs
a read lock on the i_mmap tree.  I don't think hugetlb_change_protection()
needs the write lock either.  Nor retract_page_tables().
