You're already paying for bounds checking. Receiving a message via a
datagram socket is basically the same thing as what UFFD's read is
doing anyway.

My point isn't "hey, you should write this in Python". (Although for
prototyping, why not?) My point is that where there's an existing
kernel interface for exactly the functionality you want, you should
use it instead of inventing some new thing, because when we use the
same interface for things have the same shape and purpose, we not only
get to reuse code, but also the knowledge in people's heads.

SCM_RIGHTS (AFAIK) is the only bit of ancillary data which indicates
that the kernel has created a file descriptor in the process doing the
recvmsg.

Why would we limit recvmsg to AF_UNIX? We can receive ancillary data
on other sockets, e.g., netlink. SCM_RIGHTS works only with AF_UNIX
right now, but this limitation isn't written in stone.

Programs generally don't go calling recvmsg() on random FDs they get
from the outside world. They do call read() on those FDs, which is why
read() having unexpected side effects is terrible.

If you call it with a non-empty ancillary data buffer, you know to
react to what you get. You're *opting into* the possibility of getting
file descriptors. Sure, it's theoretically possible that a program
calls recvmsg on random FDs it gets from unknown sources, sees
SCM_RIGHTS unexpectedly, and just the SCM_RIGHTS message and its FD
payload, but that's an outright bug, while calling read() on stdin is
no bug.

Anyway, IMHO, UFFD should be a netlink-like SOCK_DGRAM socket that
sends FDs with SCM_RIGHTS. This interface is already very efficient --
people have been optimizing the hell out of AF_UNIX for decades ---
and this interface provides exactly the right interface semantics for
what UFFD needs to do.
