Actually, there is no difference between the two approaches for
generating the external documentation[1]

Ok, I'll change that :)

Could you tell me the tree/branch that you had applied Bart's "[PATCH
0/8] Block layer patches for kernel v5.5"? I'll need to rebase my work
on top of that because of the patch "[PATCH 6/8] block: Document all
members of blk_mq_tag_set and bkl_mq_queue_map".

Thanks,
    André
