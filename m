Ah, I think I found it:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/2cbdedd5eca0a57d9596671a99da5fab8e60722b/sys-apps/upstart/files/upstart-1.2-dircrypto.patch

The init process does EXT4_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY on /, and if the error is
EOPNOTSUPP, it skips creating the "dircrypto" keyring.  So then cryptohome can't
add keys later.  (Note the error message you got, "Error adding dircrypto key".)

So it looks like the kernel patch broke both that and
ext4_dir_encryption_supported().

I don't see how it could have broken cryptohome by itself, since AFAICS
cryptohome only uses EXT4_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_POLICY on the partition which is
supposed to have the 'encrypt' feature set.
