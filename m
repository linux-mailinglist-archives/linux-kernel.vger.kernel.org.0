What does "fail" mean ?

Those are work arounds. Actually fixing the problem is usually
preferable.

 So if rephrase your problem:

 * We have 2 clock controllers (A and B)
 * Clock are passed between the controllers using DT
 * We have a PLL in controller B which is used by clocks in
   controller A.
 * the PLL parent clock is in controller A.

=3D> So if I understand correctly you are saying that it will "fail"
because there is a circular dependency between controller A and B, right
?

Do you have evidence that your problem comes from this circular
dependency ?

AFAIK, CCF will orphan the clock and continue if the parent is not
available. Later, when the parent comes up, the orphan will be
reparented.

IOW, the problem you are reporting should already be covered by CCF.

Neither, I'm afraid

My bet would be that an important clocks (maybe more than 1) is being
gated during the init process.

Maybe you should try the command line parameter "clk_ignore_unused"
until you get things running with your 2 controllers.
