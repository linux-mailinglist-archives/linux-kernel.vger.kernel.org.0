You can have multiple possible connectors for a given encoder, and
multiple possible encoders for a given connector. In both cases the
driver picks for you. But for active encoders and connectors the
relationship is 1:1. That's what the helpers exploit by looping over
connectors to get at encoders.

Well as explained, there's 3 ways you can achieve the same really. I
do think the "loop over connectors in drm_atomic_state, WARN() if we
haven't found the encoder you want the crtc for" is probably the most
solid aproach since it picks up a core atomic concept. But the others
(looping the connector list, or looping encoder_mask) all work too.

Aside: plane/encoder_mask was added to go from crtc to
planes/encoders, not really to go the other way round.

Another solution would be to pass the connector_state to all atomic
encoder hooks, then you could just look at connector_state->crtc. Plus
you can get at all the other interesting bits and pieces of
information. In a way this is fallout from us keeping encoders as a
meaningful concept for easier transition of legacy drivers, while
still keeping them entirely irrelevant for the actual userspace api
semantics.

So maybe we want drm_atomic_encoder_get_old/new_connector here. Or
maybe we even want the full set of functions, i.e.
drm_atomic_encoder_get_old/new_connector/crtc.

In all cases I think only returning the object, not it's state is
simplest, since then you avoid the confusion of old/new state for
old/new obj.
