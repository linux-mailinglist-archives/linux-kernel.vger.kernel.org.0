1 - How is your solution - including a public key with each event - 
related to this issue?

2 - I don't understand how a large cloud affects scale.  Wouldn't the 
verifier would typically be checking known machines - those of their 
enterprise - not every machine on the cloud?

Can't we assume a typical attestation use case has a fairly locked down 
OS with a limited number of applications.

Like I said, it should be rare.  In the worst case, can't the service 
tell by trying both keys?

I thought your solution was to change the IMA measurements, adding the 
public key to each entry with a new template?  Did I misunderstand, or 
do you have a new proposal?

If the service already has trusted keys from a trusted source, why do 
they have to come from the client at all?

How does this solve the collision issue?  If there are two keys with the 
same key ID, isn't there still a collision?

I understand how the client keyring is used in IMA to check file
signatures, but how is that related to the attestation service?
