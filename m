No, only in the C1 which sets the limit, because that is the woriking
set we want to protect.

In the scheme with the inherited protection it would act as the gate
and require an explicit low limit setup defaulting to 0 if none is
specified.

So let's see how that works in practice, say a multi workload setup
with a complex/deep cgroup hierachies (e.g. your above example). No
delegation point this time.

C1 asks for low=1G while using 500M, C3 low=100M using 80M.  B1 and
B2 are completely independent workloads and the same applies to C2 which
doesn't ask for any protection at all? C2 uses 100M. Now the admin has
to propagate protection upwards so B1 low=1G, B2 low=100M and A low=1G,
right? Let's say we have a global reclaim due to external pressure that
originates from outside of A hierarchy (it is not overcommited on the
protection).

Unless I miss something C2 would get a protection even though nobody
asked for it.

So how are we going to deal with hierarchies where the actual workload
of interest is a leaf deeper in the hierarchy and the upper levels of
the hierarchy are shared between unrelated workloads?  Look at how
systemd organizes system into cgroups for example (slices vs. scopes)
and say you want to add a protection to a single user or a service.

Yes I do agree that the problem you are dealing with is slightly
different. My main point was that you are already introducing a new
semantic which is not fully backward compatible and I figured we have
more problems in the area and maybe we can introduce a semantic to
handle both above mentioned scenarios while doing that.
