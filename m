I wrote a fun long rant of a response here, but deleted it so now I feel
better.  But that doesn't help anyone but myself, so here's my censored
response instead...

Intel had months of review time for this document before this was
published.  Your lawyers had it and never objected to this lack of
inclusion at all, and explictitly said that the document as written was
fine with them.  So I'm sorry, but it is much too late to add something
like this to the document at this point in time.

If your legal department has any remaining objections like this, please
bring it up in the proper legal forum where all of the other companies
that already discussed this in can review and discuss it.  As it is,
including something like this would require their buy-in anyway, and
obviously that did not happen with this proposal.

So no, I'm not going to apply this change, sorry.

Oh, and cute use of the term, "timely manner", as if we are going to
fall for that one again... :)
