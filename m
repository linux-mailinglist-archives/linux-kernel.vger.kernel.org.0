I see only one incorrect, in kasan_init(): early_pfn_to_nid(__pa(_stext))
It should be wrapped with PFN_DOWN().
Other usages in map_range() seems to be correct, range->start,end is pfns.

Hold on a sec, just spotted another thing to fix.

This should be VMALLOC_START, there is no point to allocate pgds for the hole between linear mapping
and vmalloc, just waste of memory. It make sense to map early shadow for that hole, because if code
dereferences address in that hole we will see the page fault on that address instead of fault on the shadow.

So something like this might work:

	kasan_populate_early_shadow(
		kasan_mem_to_shadow((void *)PAGE_OFFSET + MAXMEM),
		kasan_mem_to_shadow((void *)VMALLOC_START));

	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC)
		kasan_shallow_populate_pgds(kasan_mem_to_shadow(VMALLOC_START), kasan_mem_to_shadow((void *)VMALLOC_END))
	else
		kasan_populate_early_shadow(kasan_mem_to_shadow(VMALLOC_START), kasan_mem_to_shadow((void *)VMALLOC_END));

	kasan_populate_early_shadow(
		kasan_mem_to_shadow((void *)VMALLOC_END + 1),
		shadow_cpu_entry_begin);
