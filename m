The system has
[    0.000000] ACPI: SRAT: Node 1 PXM 1 [mem 0x10000000000-0x17fffffffff]
[    0.000000] ACPI: SRAT: Node 2 PXM 2 [mem 0x80000000000-0x87fffffffff]
[    0.000000] ACPI: SRAT: Node 3 PXM 3 [mem 0x90000000000-0x97fffffffff]
[    0.000000] ACPI: SRAT: Node 4 PXM 4 [mem 0x100000000000-0x107fffffffff]
[    0.000000] ACPI: SRAT: Node 5 PXM 5 [mem 0x110000000000-0x117fffffffff]
[    0.000000] ACPI: SRAT: Node 6 PXM 6 [mem 0x180000000000-0x183fffffffff]
[    0.000000] ACPI: SRAT: Node 7 PXM 7 [mem 0x190000000000-0x191fffffffff]

hotplugable memory. I would love to have those 7 memory blocks to work
with. Any smaller grained split is just not helping as the platform will
not be able to hotremove it anyway.
