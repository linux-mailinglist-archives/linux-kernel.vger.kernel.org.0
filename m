Laurent just asked me on irc how to get from a bridge to connector
information. Bridge knows its encoder (it's static), so a encode2connector
function would already have a 2nd user with this.

I.e. I'd say +1 on that approach, and then you can get at the connector
state and whatever else you feel like from there?

Adding Laurent.
