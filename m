yeah, I already have an updated patch in the works which also does the
rework Bjorn suggested. Had no time yet to test if I didn't mess it
up.

I am also thinking of adding a kernel parameter to enable this
workaround on demand, but not quite sure on that one yet.

I think I already tried this path. The problem isn't that the device
isn't accessible too late, but that it seems that the device
completely falls off the bus. But I can retest again just to be sure.
