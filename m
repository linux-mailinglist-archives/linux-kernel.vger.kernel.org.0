Clearly I was too tired when I did that allmodconfig build, because it
very much does generate a warning :-/.

Thank you 0day:

  kernel/sched/core.o: warning: objtool: finish_task_switch()+0x1c0: objtool isn't smart enough to handle this CFI save/restore combo

At least this gives clue as to what it was trying to do.

Subject: objtool: Remove CFI save/restore special case
From: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>

There is a special case in the UNWIND_HINT_RESTORE code. When, upon
looking for the UNWIND_HINT_SAVE instruction to restore from, it finds
the instruction hasn't been visited yet, it normally issues a WARN,
except when this HINT_SAVE instruction is the first instruction of
this branch.

The reason for this special case comes apparent when we remove it;
code like:

	if (cond) {
		UNWIND_HINT_SAVE
		// do stuff
		UNWIND_HINT_RESTORE
	}
	// more stuff

will now trigger the warning. This is because UNWIND_HINT_RESTORE is
just a label, and there is nothing keeping it inside the (extended)
basic block covered by @cond. It will attach itself to the first
instruction of 'more stuff' and we'll hit it outside of the @cond,
confusing things.

I don't much like this special case, it confuses things and will come
apart horribly if/when the annotation needs to support nesting.
Instead extend the affected code to at least form an extended basic
block.

In particular, of the 2 users of this annotation: ftrace_regs_caller()
and sync_core(), only the latter suffers this problem. Extend it's
code sequence with a NOP to make it an extended basic block.

This isn't ideal either; stuffing code with NOPs just to make
annotations work is certainly sub-optimal, but given that sync_core()
is stupid expensive in any case, one extra nop isn't going to be a
problem here.
