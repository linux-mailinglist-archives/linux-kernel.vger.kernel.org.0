The problem is that device links don't allow creating a cyclic
dependency graph -- for good reasons. The last link in the cycle would
be rejected. I don't think trying to change device link to allow
cyclic links is the right direction to go in nor is it a can of worms
I want to open.

So, we'll need some other way of tracking the loop and then allowing
only those devices in a loop to attempt probing even if their
suppliers haven't probed. And then if a device ends up being in more
than one loop, things could get even more complicated. And after one
of the devices in the loop probes, we still need to somehow figure out
the "bad" link and delete it so the last "good" link can be made
before all the suppliers have their sync_state() called (because the
"good" link hasn't been created yet). That all gets pretty messy. If
we are never going to accept any DT changes, then I'd rather go with
edit_links() and keep the complexity within the one off weird hardware
where there are cycles instead of over complicating the driver core.

No, we need to only ignore the "bad" dependency. We can't ignore all
the dependencies in the cycle because that would cause the suppliers
to clean up the hardware state before the consumers are ready.

Agreed. In this case, if the device used the depends-on property,
it'll have to list the 1 clock controller and the regulator.

I understand you are basically asking for a "does-not-depend-on"
property (like a black list). But I think a whitelist on the rare
occasions that we need to override would give more flexibility than a
blacklist. It'll also mean we don't have to check every supplier with
the entire black list each time.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if interconnects end up with cyclic
dependencies as support for more of them are added.

I definitely don't want per-supplier type override. That's just making
things too complicated and adding too many DT properties if we need to
override more than clocks.
