As I understand it, the probability of making a transition from the
MCS to CNA phase
in less than N lock handovers is 1 - p^N, where p is the probability
that probably()
returns true (default 99%). So in high contention situations where N can become
quite large in a relatively short period of time, the probability of
getting into the CNA
phase is high, e.g. 95% when N = 300.

I was wondering whether it would be possible to detect contention and make a
phase transition deterministically, maybe by reusing the intra_count
variable to keep
track of the processing rate in the MCS phase?

As Will pointed out earlier, this would make formal analysis and
verification of the
CNA qspinlock much more feasible.

Make sense. Thanks a lot for the clarification :)

Best,
