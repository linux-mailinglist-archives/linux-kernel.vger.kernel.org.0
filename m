I see, I must admit I missed this part.

I guess it's not technically broken but was is really necessary though 
to use this notion of companion ACPI device? For the controller it makes 
sense, that's how to match ACPI and PCI, but since Soundwire slaves are 
not fully enumerable, precisely why we need all these _DSD properties, 
couldn't we just use ACPI devices directly?
