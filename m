I agree with that. It makes it a bit hard to determine the equilibrium
in advance.

I think the assumptions for this example don't hold (anymore).
Because reclaim rate depends on the usage above protection, the siblings
won't be reclaimed equally and so the low_usage proportionality will
change over time and the equilibrium distribution is IMO different (I'm
attaching an Octave script to calculate it).

As it depends on the initial usage, I don't think there can be given
such a general example (for overcommit).

Although it's a different issue but since this updates the docs I'm
mentioning it -- we treat memory.min the same, i.e. it's subject to the
same race, however, it's not meant to be best effort. I didn't look into
outcomes of potential misaccounting but the comment seems to miss impact
on memory.min protection.

Shouldn't this condition be 'if (parent == root_mem_cgroup)'? (I.e. 1st
level takes direct input, but 2nd and further levels redistribute only
what they really got from parent.)
