Hi Greg,
It is a crypto thing and it should be accessed via akcipher crypto API.
But akcipher userspace crypto API is not implemented in kernel. See
below.

Here are the replies to the last attempt
https://marc.info/?t=150234726200004&r=1&w=2
This was back in 2017, apparently there were some problems and it was not
merged even after 8 versions.

If it was implemented via akcipher, the user would be unable to set
private key, which is a method the akcipher implementation should
implement. But this probably is not that big a problem.

Messages are 521 bits, I rounded them to 68 bytes. The idea is that a
sha512 hash of the original message is to be signed.
Signatures are 136 bytes.

Because the akcipher userspace crypto API is not merged and it probably
will take a lot of time, if it ever will be merged. Till then I would
like if this feature was supported on this one device somehow in
mainline kernel. As soon as akcipher userspace crypto API is merged, I
can rewrite the driver.

A char device to read/write would be possible. The sysfs API
seemed more strainthforward. Should I do the char device approach
instead?

I will,

Thanks.
