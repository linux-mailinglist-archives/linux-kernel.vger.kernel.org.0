We already do that:

bool take_page_off_buddy(struct page *page)
 {
	... 
        spin_lock_irqsave(&zone->lock, flags);
        for (order = 0; order < MAX_ORDER; order++) {
                struct page *page_head = page - (pfn & ((1 << order) - 1));
                int buddy_order = page_order(page_head);
                struct free_area *area = &(zone->free_area[buddy_order]);

                if (PageBuddy(page_head) && buddy_order >= order) {
	...
 }

Actually, we __only__ call break_down_buddy_pages() (which breaks down a higher-order page
and keeps our page out of buddy) if that is true.

In this case, there is nothing to be recovered from.
If we wanted to soft-offline a page that was free, and then it was allocated
in the meantime, there is no harm in that as we do not flag the page
until we are sure it is under our control.
That means:

 - for free pages: was succesfully taken off buddy
 - in use pages: was freed or migrated

So, opposite to hard-offline, in soft-offline we do not fiddle with pages
unless we are sure the page is not reachable anymore by any means.

I will work on that.
