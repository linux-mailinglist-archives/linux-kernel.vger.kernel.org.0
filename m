Great. Please put this sort of information in the commit text.

Ok, and in this case somehow CLK_OPS_PARENT_ENABLE flag doesn't work? Is
that because the clk itself doesn't do anything unless it's enabled?  I
seem to recall that we usually work around this by caching the state of
the clk parents or frequencies and then when the clk prepare or enable
op is called we actually write the hardware to change the state. There
are some qcom clks like this and we basically just use the hardware
itself to cache the state of the clk while it hasn't actually changed to
be at that rate, because the clk is not enabled yet.

The main concern is that we're having to turn on clks to make things
work, when it would be best to not turn on clks just so that register
writes actually make a difference to what the hardware does.
