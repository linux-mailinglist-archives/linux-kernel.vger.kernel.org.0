EAS is Energy Aware Scheduling. It was merged in 5.0.

Lisa is a python based testing platform that has dependency on other binaries
like trace-cmd, rt-app, etc. It is not suitable for kernel submission.

Lisa, or any userspace based testing for that matter, requires to know what's
happening inside the scheduler to test its behavior. I don't know know of any
other scheduler centric testing framework. I didn't intend to specify Lisa as
the sole user and reason for these tracepoints, I know others are interested in
these tracepoints in general for anyone who wants to achieve a similar goal of
studying scheduler PELT behavior and how it affects some of the decisions it
makes.

We had a talk in OSPM a couple of weeks ago to cover this topic if you're
interested to learn more

I see that Peter has already covered this part.
