Ok with me.

I don't have a problem with that, as long as it only applies in conjunction
with the whitelist. The whitelist would determine if the pwmX_enable attribute
is supported. If it is, pwmX can only be written if pwm1_enable is set to 1
(manual fan speed control). This is pretty common for other drivers.
