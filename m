The kernel ignores RLIMIT_RSS. Unless the browser takes it into
consideration then I do not see how that would help.

Yes, this should help to isolate the problem.

It is true that the memory reclaim is quite page cache reclaim biased
unless there is very small amount of the page cache. Page cache refault
is considered during the reclaim but I am afraid that there are still
corner cases where the workload might end up threshing. Be it on the
page cache or the anonymous memory depending on the workload. Anyway
getting data from real workloads is always good so that we can think on
improving existing heuristics.
