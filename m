For now I don't know why, codes seem should work as you said, maybe I need to
trace more of the internals.
But weird thing is that once I set the people-disliked-tunable iowait
drop down instantly, this is contradictory to the code design.

Kind of agree, but it does fix the issue at least mine and user response
time also improve in the meantime.
So, just make it as it were and exported to someone needs it..
