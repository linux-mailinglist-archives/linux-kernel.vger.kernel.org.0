What I mean is that cpus_have_const_cap() will be false initially, so we'll
put down global mappings early on because PTE_MAYBE_NG will be 0, which
means that we'll have to invoke the rewriting code if we then realise we
want non-global mappings after the caps are finalised.

Yeah, and I think you probably run into chicken and egg problems mapping
the thing. With the change above, it's true that /some/ mappings will
still be nG if you pass kpti=off, but I was hoping that didn't really matter
:)

What was the behaviour prior to your patch? If it used to work without
any nG mappings, then I suppose we should try to restore that behaviour.
