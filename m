Adding a "depends on X86 || COMPILE_TEST" should fix the issue, as
X86 is never set on arm64, nor on any other architecture than X86.
If COMPILE_TEST=y, it's normal expected behavior to show the question.

If the option doesn't make sense on arm64 (more broadly: on non-X86),
it should depend on X86 || COMPILE_TEST, to avoid spamming the user
with (zillions of) options that do not matter for his platform.

Good.

OK.

Please don't do that, as it with always enable the driver if COMPILE_TEST=y,
without providing a way to opt-out for the user.

Thanks!
