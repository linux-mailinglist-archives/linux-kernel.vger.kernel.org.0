This sounds reasonable.  But

lr_ratio < NUMA_PERIOD_THRESHOLD

doesn't indicate More Remote.  If Local = Remote, it is also true.  If
there are also more Shared, we should slow down the scanning.  So, the
logic could be

if (lr_ratio >= NUMA_PERIOD_THRESHOLD)
    slow down scanning
else if (sp_ratio >= NUMA_PERIOD_THRESHOLD) {
    if (NUMA_PERIOD_SLOTS - lr_ratio >= NUMA_PERIOD_THRESHOLD)
        speed up scanning
    else
        slow down scanning
} else
   speed up scanning

This follows your idea better?

Best Regards,
Huang, Ying
