Nor am I, but generally the distinction I'm trying to achieve is
whether the reserved region is necessary for the device operation or
for the system operation.  If we deny the IGD device its mapping to
stolen memory, then maybe the IGD device doesn't work, no big deal.  If
we deny USB its RMRR, then we assume we're only cutting off PS/2
emulation that we expect isn't used at this point anyway.  Both of these
are choices in how the driver wants to use the device.  On the other
hand if we have a system where management firmware has backdoors to
devices for system health monitoring, then declining to honor the RMRR
has larger implications.  Thanks,

Alex
