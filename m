On the arm64 front, you'd *have* to pass a DT to the kernel (as that's
where we get the command line from), and we *only* discover memory
from the DT or EFI memory map, so the arguments above aren't generally
applicable. You can enumerate virtio-mmio devices from DT, also.

Device-specific constraints on memory should really be described in a
per-device fashion in the FW tables so that the OS can decide how to
handle them. Just becuase one device can only access memory in a
specific 1MiB window doesn't mean all other should be forced to share
the same constraint. I think that's what Christoph was alluding to.

Thanks,
Mark.
