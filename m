It depends. In this case, vhci_hcd is virtual driver and maintains
port status for devices that are remote. It checks hcd->state in
vhci_hub_status().

It updates the hcd->state in suspend with vhci->lock hold and checks
status from vhci_hub_status(). Removing updating hcd->state from 
vhci_bus_suspend()will open a window where vhci_hub_status() might
find it wrong state.

Same thing for HC_STATE_RUNNING. There are few other drivers that
do the same for similar reasons. xhci_hcd, and dummy_hcd and a few
more. This is the same comment on your patch that removes
HC_STATE_RUNNING update from resume.

This won't fully test the condition since there are remote devices
attached and triggering suspend while attach/detach is in progress.
