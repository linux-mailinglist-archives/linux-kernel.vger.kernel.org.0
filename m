Right, that's the reason I said "If the race really matters". I thought
that other writers/readers always take sighand lock. So the easy fix
would have been to take sighand lock too.
The alternative is that we need to fiddle with task_struct itself and
replace flags with an atomic_t or sm which is more invasive and probably
more controversial.
