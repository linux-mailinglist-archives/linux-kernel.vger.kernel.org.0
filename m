According to MAINTAINERS, you're the maintainer and not Arnd.  You
should forward this to him.  But in the future it might be easier if
Arnd added himself to the MAINTAINERS file for this.

You're probably better off if you have a subsystem mailing list for this
driver instead of using LKML.  That way more people can get involved
with the development if they want to.

Anyway, as the maintainer, you need to collect patches and forward them
on to Arnd or someone else.  Since you are handling the patches, that
means you need to Sign them to certify that you haven't added any of
SCOs private super secret UNIXWARE intellectual property.  You can't
just use the Acked-by, you have to use the Signed-off-by tag.

If Arnd or someone else is collecting the patches then you could use
Reviewed-by or Acked-by.  Acked-by basically means you approve the
patch and often it's going through a different maintainer's tree.  Or it
can be you like the approach the patch is taking.  It's sort of vague.
I seldom Ack patches because I'm not a maintainer in an official sense,
but I do give people a Reviewed-by tag if I review their patch and I
want to make their day a little happier.  Also if it's a huge patch
series and I want to help out Greg to know that he can skip reviewing
the patch if he wants to.
