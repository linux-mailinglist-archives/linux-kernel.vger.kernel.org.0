OK that's established. I am sorry for using the TTL "totempole"
term here, it is out of place for CMOS indeed.

Very nice detailing and references, I read them all :)

OK so the pin controller will act as back-end for this and the
drivers are expected to use that.

I suppose you are defining new HSxxx-specific pin control
states for them? I suppose it would be good to see how it
works end-to-end. (But fine, I get it so far.)

So the operating system reads the ext CSD and uses that
information to set the drive strength using pin control in the
Linux case.

What is the unit of this driver strength field in the ext CSD?

And consequently this:

+  fixed-emmc-driver-type-hs200:
+    allOf:
+      - $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
+      - minimum: 0
+      - maximum: 4
+    description:
+      Same as "fixed-emmc-driver-type", but specific to HS200 mode.
+      If defined, overrides "fixed-emmc-driver-type" in HS200 mode.

This thing that is 0,1,2,3,4, what unit is that?

If we established it is the number of push-pull stages OR:ed
together we should document it. Since it is supposed to be
used with different host controllers, it certainly cannot be
unitless or "vendor specific" since you have two sides to
it, the card ext CSD and this, and then the pin controller
side. (I'm not a standards person buy certainly JEDEC
must have thought of that?)

OK this text should really be in the commit message and the
bindings because this isn't clear from context.

It confused me so it will confuse others.

I still don't quite get it, sorry if I'm dumb :/

Do you mean that the eMMC advertise some drive strengths in
the ext CSD and the device tree properties are there to mitigate
or override these and disallow them because of limitations in the
host controller or associated electronics? That sounds more
like something the system integrator/manufacturer decide than
the eMMC vendor.

Or it it a bug in the ext CSD so that the eMMC advertise strengths
it shouldn't? Then we should use a quirk for the card ID
rather than a DT property.

I think I understand this now! Some nice details above

Now that it's clear that this is to restrict the drive strengths
used I understand it better!

I'm a bit confused. This "recommendation" sounds like some
errata actually.

If the case is that eMMC vendor has recommended certain stuff
in the ext CSD and you need to augment that with the device tree
config, that sounds like the wrong approach. It is a bug in that
eMMCs ext CSD is it not?

Why can't we use code for this and just add a per-card quirk
instead if there are errors in the drive strengths recommended
in the ext CSD? Like the other stuff in drivers/mmc/core/quirks.h.

That makes the same card work on any other host without any
device tree special properties, hopefully.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
