I would expect the device is not added to the list of backend devices
until the probe hook has finished with a non-error return code. Ie:
bus_for_each_dev should _not_ iterate over devices for which the probe
function hasn't been run to competition without errors.

The same way I would expect the remove hook to first remove the device
from the list of backend devices and then run the remove hook.

blkback uses an ad-hoc reference counting mechanism, but if the above
assumptions are true I think it would be enough to take an extra
reference in xen_blkbk_probe and drop it in xen_blkbk_remove.

Additionally it might be interesting to switch the ad-hoc reference
counting to use get_device/put_device (in a separate patch), but I'm
not sure how feasible that is.

Roger.
