Sorry I didn't descibe it clearly.
When sending a reset command, now the reset order is first BME and then xhci.
BME reset would make xhci controller stop, resulting in xhci reset failure,
because it can't finish stop ep command in xhci_urb_dequeue.
I'm not sure if this situation is in expectation.

I think this approach not work. When reset BME, xhci controller is stopped and
can't recover even BME is set enable later. According to xhci spec, it's appropriate.
When rebind it afterward, with xhci stop, xhci driver would consider the
xhci controller already died and it fails to work again.

To recover xhci, now I rmmod xhci-pci.ko and then insmod it again.
