No problem. The number of times I missed messages... ugh.

That makes sense.

As exceptions typically disable interrupts, we treat them as their own
context. Especially for looking at recursion detection algorithms,
which allow for different contexts to recurse.

Normal-context -> softirq -> exception / IRQ -> NMI


Anyway, that WARN_ON_IN_IRQ() should come with a big comment about why
we allow it if we have pagefault_disable() set.

This will need to go through the x86 maintainers. I'll go and review
the tracing patches of this series and give an ack / reviewed-by if
there's no issues.
