I don't have the rpmcc series in my queue. I think it needs a resend?

Can you add more to the comment? Right now it doesn't explain the _why_
part that you describe in the first paragraph here. That's what I'm
asking to be put here as a comment. Also, GCC is the one exporting the
XO clk on this platform so I'm a little lost why we're talking about rpm
here.

I guess I'm left to do the ton of work myself and get to have clk
providers like this be clk consumers so that probe ordering is correct
and clks aren't exposed until the whole parent chain exists. This is
taking a step backwards and causes me to be sad.

Yes, please resend without the binding patch that I've already applied.
