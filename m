It is what people have been using for a long time. Memory hole ->=20
PG_reserved. The memmap is valid, but people want to tell "this here is=20
crap, don't look at it".

That's what I was asking. I can see "support" for this was added=20
basically right from the beginning. I'd say we rip that out and=20
cleanup/simplify. I am not aware of a platform that requires this.=20
Especially, memory holes on DIMMs (detected during boot) seem like an=20
unlikely thing.


--=20
