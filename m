Hi Eric,

I doubt it is necessary to add FUA tag for all writeback bios, it is
unnecessary. If power failure happens after dirty data written to
backing device and the bkey turns into clean, a following read request
will go to cache device because the LBA can be indexed no matter it is
dirty or clean. Unless the bkey is invalidated from the B+tree, read
will always go to cache device firstly in writeback mode. If a power
failure happens before the cached bkey turns from dirty to clean, just
an extra writeback bio flushed from cache device to backing device with
identical data. Comparing the FUA tag for all writeback bios (it will be
really slow), the extra writeback IOs after a power failure is more
acceptable to me.
