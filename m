There was a recent mail from somebody using TX1 with this binding, although
it didn't actually appear to be working (but I'm not sure how much of that
is the bindings fault):

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2019-October/683992.html

However, I agree with you, which is why the new Kconfig option actually
disables the legacy bindings by default in the hope that we can remove it
in a few releases time, with an easy "get things sorta working" option in
the meantime.
