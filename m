You should have the "tpm:" tag in the beginning of short summary.

Should be "TPM command", not "tpm command". Please be more strict
with the spelling.

EOF the long description.

This should not be part of the commit message but instead should be
placed just before diffstat (below two dashes in the patch) so that
it doesn't get included into commit log.

You should take time and write what the commit does and why it
does what it does. That is the meat of the commit message and
your commit is completely lacking it.

I'll look at the code change once it is described appropriately.

For more information how to do commit properly I would advice
to go through the material in
