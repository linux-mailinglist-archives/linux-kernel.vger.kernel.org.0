Subject: Re: Why will no-one sue GrSecurity for their blatant GPL violation

I am a lawyer. GrSecurity is violating section 6 of version 2 of the 
GPL, which is the license in question.

GrSecurity does not have an independent right to create nor distribute 
non-separable derivative works of the Work(s) in question. By default 
they have NO right to do so.

The copyright holders have unilaterally granted permission (it is not a 
contract: there is no consideration (payment) on the side of GrSecurity 
in-order to receive these permissions) to others, but not in an 
unlimited fastion.

The Copyright holders have chosen to decide that any derivative work can 
ONLY be distributed if NO additional restrictive terms are proffered 
between the licensee and furthur licensees.

Section 6 states this. If the licensee proffers additional restrictive 
terms his license is terminated [(note: the copyright holder, in this 
case, can also step in and terminate the license for any reason he 
wishes: the free-licensee does not have any contract-law 
breach-of-contract defenses to raise against the copyright owner since 
there is no contract: only a copyright license (permission) (not a 
copyright license contract (bargained for rights purchased from the 
copyright owner))].

Here GrSecurity (Open Source Security) has, indeed, produced an 
additional restrictive term governing the relationship between it and 
the further-licensees relating back to the Work(s) in question.

GrSecurity's restrictive covenant can also be shown to the court to have 
been a success additionally: no down-the-line licensee has defied it and 
released the source code.

Under the Original Copyright Owners writing, which is explained in 
detail in the license, the down-the-line licensees are to have Free 
choice in distributing any derivative work (obviously the derivative 
work has to be non-seperable, grsec is non-seperable, that is not in 
dispute). Here GrSecurity requires them to agree /not/ to ever exercise 
that which the Copyright holders explicitly permitted and forbade the 
excision of.

Yes, GrSecurity's writing is an additional restrictive term, yes they 
are violating the express terms of the license, yes they are committing 
copyright infringement, yes their license has terminated.

And yes IAAL.

The courts do NOT take your 
absolute-literal-we-can't-do-anything-about-it programmer's approach.

Anyway, I was not asking if you think it is a violation: I know it is a 
violation, and a blatant one at that: I'm asking why no-one will SUE 
them for it, so far.
