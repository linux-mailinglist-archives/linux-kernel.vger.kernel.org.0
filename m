Hello,

Is there a history diagram somewhere that shows where specific features =
appear in the codebase?

Various online documentation for kernel driver development have =
references to functions that, in some cases, are either deprecated or do =
not yet exist in older versions of kernel source.

For example, I have written an interrupt service driver for an embedded =
application running on kernel version 2.6.21.  The original driver is =
level triggered and requires the driver to:=20

a.) Temporarily disable the interrupt
b.) Service the interrupt
c.) Re-enable the interrupt

There was some desire for that driver to move to a more standard rising =
edge trigger.

In that line of thought , the documentation suggests    ' =
irq_set_irq_type'  with flag     'IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING'.

That function was experimental at one point, and doesn't appear to be =
available in the 2.6.21 source.
I did a      'find' -> 'while read' -> 'fgrep'  search to find the =
function declaration in headers but had no luck under 2.6.21 .

-- My specific questions --

Question 1.)   Is  'irq_set_irq_type'  still experimental ?
Question 2.)   At what version of the kernel source does the function =
appear?
Question 3.)  If the function exists for  2.6.21  What headers are =
required to allow effective compilation?


-- Notes and suggestions regarding kernel function documentation --

Note 1.) Perhaps functions should be documented with indications of what =
kernel versions they apply to.
Note 2.) In function documentation, an indication of what headers to =
include supporting each specific function would be nice.

Thank you for your time and comments,

Peter
