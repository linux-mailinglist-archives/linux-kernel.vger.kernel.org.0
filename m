Precisely, what is your suggestion?

If you think that replacing the call to __get_user_bad with BUILD_BUG(),
BUILD_BUG() becomes a no-op when __OPTIMIZE__ is not defined (see the
definition of __compiletime_assert() in linux/compiler.h); this means
such places will be reachable, which leads to uninitialised variables.

I think you ought to read the GCC manual wrt __builtin_unreachable().
"If control flow reaches the point of the `__builtin_unreachable',
 the program is undefined.  It is useful in situations where the
 compiler cannot deduce the unreachability of the code."

I have seen cases where the instructions following an unreachable
code section have been the literal pool for the function - which,
if reached, would be quite confusing to debug.  If you're lucky, you
might get an undefined instruction exception.  If not, you could
continue and start executing another part of the function, leading
to possibly no crash at all - but unexpected results (which may end
up leaking sensitive data.)

For example, in our BUG() implementation on 32-bit ARM, we use
unreachable() after the asm() statement creating the bug table
entry and inserting the undefined instruction into the text.
Here's the resulting disassembly:

     278:       ebfffffe        bl      0 <page_mapped>
                        278: R_ARM_CALL page_mapped
     27c:       e3500000        cmp     r0, #0
     280:       1a00006c        bne     438 <invalidate_inode_pages2_range+0x3ac>
...
     2d4:       ebfffffe        bl      0 <_raw_spin_lock_irqsave>
                        2d4: R_ARM_CALL _raw_spin_lock_irqsave
     2d8:       e5943008        ldr     r3, [r4, #8]
     2dc:       e3130001        tst     r3, #1
     2e0:       e1a02000        mov     r2, r0
     2e4:       1a000054        bne     43c <invalidate_inode_pages2_range+0x3b0>
...
     438:       e7f001f2        .word   0xe7f001f2
     43c:       e2433001        sub     r3, r3, #1
     440:       eaffffa9        b       2ec <invalidate_inode_pages2_range+0x260>

Now, consider what unreachable() actually gets you here - it tells
the compiler that we do not expect to reach this point (that being
the point between 438 and 43c.)  If we were to reach that point, we
would continue executing the code at 43c.

In this case, it would be like...

	if (BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)))
	    goto random-location-in-xa_lock_irqsave()-inside-invalidate_complete_page2();

So no.  unreachable() is not an option.

We really do want these places to be compile-time detected - relying
on triggering them at runtime is just not good enough IMHO (think
about how much testing the kernel would require to discover one of
these suckers buried in the depths of the code.)

Here's the question to ask: do we want to reliably detect issues
that we know are bad, which can lead to:
- unreliable kernel operation,
- user exploitable crashes,
or do we want to hide them for the sake of allowing -O0 compilation?

Given that the kernel as a general rule has very poor run-time test
coverage at the moment, I don't think this is the time to consider
giving up the protection that we have against this badness.

We've had several instances where these checks have triggered in the
user access code, and people have noticed when doing build tests.
They probably don't have the ability to do run-time testing on every
arch.

So, the existing facility of detecting these at build time is, IMHO,
an absolute must.

It would be different if the kernel community as a whole had the
ability to run-test every code path through the kernel source on
every arch, but I don't see that's a remotely realistic prospect.

If we want -O0 to work, but still want to preserve the ability to
detect these adequately, I think the easiest solution to that would
be to provide these dummy functions only when building with -O0,
making them all BUG().
