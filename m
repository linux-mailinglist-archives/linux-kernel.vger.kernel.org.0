Well, thinking about what Nishanth said, we should probably keep the 
defconfig to bare minimal and only enable peripherals that are 
absolutely necessary for boot. We should eventually support eth / mmc-sd 
boot modes for K3 devices, but limit the configs to that.

Rest we can carry within TI internal defconfigs, including this GPIO 
enabler. If GPIO becomes a must have for some future device / 
peripheral, we can re-consider this.
