Right.

I like how this is specific on how far the stack can be off, as opposed
so say 'ignore any warning on this instruction'.

Because by saying this RET should be +8, we'll still get a warning when
this is not the case (and in fact I should strengthen the patch to
implement that).

Also, you don't want to suppress any other valid warning at that
instruction.

Furthermore, I really don't think we ought to worry about ease-of-use
here, there's really not that many people writing x86 assembly.

Fair enough.

I'm not against adding a second/separate hint for this. In fact, I
almost considered teaching objtool how to interpret the whole IRET frame
so that we can do it without hints. It's just that that's too much code
for this one case.

HINT_IRET_SELF ?
