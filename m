Yes.

There was a compiler warning and a linker error. The patch only fixes =
the compiler warning.

It turns out that HOSTCC and HOSTCXX are a gcc-4.9.4 installed through =
MacPorts.
And CC is the self-bootstrapped cross-gcc-4.9.2 toolchain for arm.

The problem is likely that they do not know of each other, i.e. the =
required
include and library search paths. Therefore HOSTCXX can't build plugins =
compatible
with CC because it does not even know its existence. Or the gcc-4.9.4 =
from MacPorts
is missing the gcc-plugin library to link against which would explain =
the HOSTLLD
error message as well.

This seems not to be found by the tests of scripts/gcc-plugin.sh. I have =
to check why...

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
