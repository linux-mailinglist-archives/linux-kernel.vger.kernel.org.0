I wasn't requiring source pages to be mapped W.  At least I didn't intend
to require W.  What I was trying to say is that SGX could trigger an
EXECMEM check if userspace attempted to EADD or EAUG an enclave page with
RWX permissions, e.g.:

  if ((SECINFO.PERMS & RWX) == RWX) {
      ret = security_mmap_file(NULL, RWX, ???);
      if (ret)
          return ret;
  }

But that's a moot point if we add security_enclave_load() or whatever.

I prefer security_enclave_load(), "from_memory" seems redundant at best.

What's the use case for this?  @maxperm will always be at least RW in
this case, otherwise the page is useless to the enclave, and if the
enclave can write the page, the fact that it started as zeros is
irrelevant.

Yep.  Requiring .sigstruct at ECREATE would be trivial.  If we wanted
flexibility we could do:

   int security_enclave_load(struct file *file, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
                             unsigned long prot);

And for ultimate flexibility we could pass both .sigstruct and the file
pointer for /dev/sgx/enclave, but that seems a bit ridiculous.

Passing both would allow tying EXECMOD to /dev/sgx/enclave as Cedric
wanted (without having to play games and pass /dev/sgx/enclave to
security_enclave_load()), but I don't think there's anything fundamentally
broken with using .sigstruct for EXECMOD.  It requires more verbose
labeling, but that's not a bad thing.
