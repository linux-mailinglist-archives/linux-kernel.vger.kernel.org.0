You previously mentioned,
"We boot from NOR flash. That's why i didn't see a problem booting probably."


Could you try the NAND device as the boot source?

- Flash the boot image into the NAND device,
  changing the value for SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES.
 -  Please find out the appropriate value for SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES
    for booting successfully.
