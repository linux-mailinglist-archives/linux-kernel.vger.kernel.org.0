I don't see anything wrong with the message.  If we actually used CR8
for interrupt priorities, we wouldn't want it to serialize.  The bug
is that the code that did the write_cr8() should have had a comment as
to how it serialized against lapic_restore().  But that doesn't seem
worth mentioning in the message, since, as noted, the real problem was
that it nonsensically restored just TPR without restoring everything
else.
