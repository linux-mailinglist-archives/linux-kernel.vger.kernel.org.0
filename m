Really, just 'true' is sufficient as you can't say which CS number it is 
here.

No. It's implied to be the same. (The tooling adds it because that's not 
how json-schema works).

You can't really because you don't know how many cells.

Generally, we expect a device knows its max and this should only be used 
it a board has a lower value. However, sometimes there's exceptions. 

Shouldn't really be debate here unless the old binding doc was wrong.

Example is fine, but shouldn't be in the schema.

We won't ever have 2 because '$ref' lookups wouldn't work. 

It only matters that we are consistent because if/when we want to 
programatically edit files, the ruamel yaml parser writes out what it is 
told, not what it read in. That also means fixing these is pretty easy.

My current position is to have them, but it's not anything I check ATM 
and I forget it too.
