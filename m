Agree 100%  These three patches cover the places *detected* so
far. For bisectability reasons they need to be upstream before
the patches that add WARN_ON, or the one that turns on alignment
traps.  As we find other places, we can fix alignments in other
structures too.

If you remember what those other places are, please let us know
so we can push patches to fix those.

If you have a better strategy to find them ... that also would
be very interesting.
