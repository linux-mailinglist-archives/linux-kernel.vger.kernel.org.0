I'm not convinced.  Given that the kernel has no way to tell that the
dynamically loaded code wasn't dynamically generated, I don't think it
makes sense to allow this in an enclave but disallow it outside an
enclave.

I'm assuming we'd make a small in-kernel change to SELinux to make it
work without policy changes, assuming the SELinux maintainers would be
okay with this.
