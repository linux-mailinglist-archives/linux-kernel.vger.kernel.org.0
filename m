I knew you were going to say that ;-)

I was too tired last night to go back and see all the issues.

One reason for the above is the module_mutex. The lock order is that
module_mutex may be called inside the ftrace_lock, but not vice-versa.

The ftrace_module_init() was called due to the setting of all modules
rw when registering a ftrace function while a module was being loaded.
We may have eliminated this issue on x86 but other archs still call
set_all_modules_text_rw/ro() when enabling function tracing. Thus, the
race will still exist there.

See commit a949ae560a511 for the description of it.

After implementing that commit, I found it a bit cleaner to handle
modules in general by breaking it up into setting nops first, and then
determining if we need to trace that module.

Yep, see commit a949ae560a511 about that too.

Because arm and nds32 still use the set_all_modules_text_rw(), this
patch would at least remove that for all archs, and only modify the
text of a module that isn't running yet. Which I thought was a plus.

Just need to be careful about other archs, or we need to at least make
sure they change too.
