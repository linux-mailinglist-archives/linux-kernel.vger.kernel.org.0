Thank you for your reply. I have read your patch. However, I would
like to solve this problem without a kernel parameter. In my view, I'd
better change the crb_fixup_cmd_size() function because the TPM CRB
driver wants to get the command buffer and response buffer sizes by
using the function.

I agree on that removing the busy bit is sufficient.
