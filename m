Sorry I was traveling last week and will be off for a large part of

Well, having only a non-reclaimable memory essentially means the
workload termination to resolve the situation. Be it an in kernel oom
killer or any other pro-active measure doing the same. On the other hand
I do understand that we shouldn't run into the system oom situation prematurely
because the userspace doesn't have enough time to react. In your example
above it takes 1M/1ms and that indeed doesn't give much room to
a potential userspace intervention. The global case already tries to
throttle on no progress (albeit only for pending writers). I do not see
a fundamental reason to not throttle on no progress here as well.

OK, fair enough. One thing that I really do not want to see is to have
this explicitly documented in the user documentation because this is an
implementation detail, userspace shouldn't depend on.

I didn't get to read the code carefully so I cannot really give my ack
but the idea seems plausible and if the current parameters turn out to
hurt some workloads we can tune from there. The important part is that
throttling doesn't push hard limit triggering to infinity because we
need the OOM killer to trigger and resolve the situation eventually as
not everybody is doing userspace oom killing.

The other important thing is that this throttling is completely
transparent to the userspace and it is a subject of the current
implementation rather than any form of contract (unlike the oom_control
example or any tunable to control the decay/max timeout etc). No
userspace should depend on it.

Thanks
