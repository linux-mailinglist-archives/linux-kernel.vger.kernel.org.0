So far so good :-)

My brain gave out around patch 14.. I'll try again tomorrow. But I'm
thinking we should be able to do as you suggest and get -16 merged.

cmpxchg8b was introduced with the Pentium (for PAE IIRC, it enabled
atomic 64bit PTEs, but Linux never used it for that) and every Intel/AMD
thereafter has had it. AFAIK there's no x86_64 chip without cmpxchg16b.
