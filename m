Hmm, I think this tracing feature will be a good idea. But in order not to
gate this patch, can we agree on keeping a temporary threshold for this
patch? Once such idea is implemented in trace subsystem, then we can remove
the temporary filter.

As Tim said, we don't want our traces flooded and this is a very useful
tracepoint as proven in our internal usage at Android. The threshold filter
is just few lines of code.
