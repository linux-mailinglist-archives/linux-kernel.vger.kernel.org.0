I think that the software driver was more of the issue in that case, 
which I'm fixing in the driver by spreading the interrupts properly.

But I am not sure which other platforms rely on this behavior.

That seems reasonable, but I like how x86 accounts only for managed 
interrupt count per-cpu when choosing the target cpu (for a managed 
interrupt).

As above, this is something which I prefer we do.

I guess that we could use irq matrix code directly if we wanted to go 
this way. That's why it is in a common location...
