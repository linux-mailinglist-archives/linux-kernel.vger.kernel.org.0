Willy, let's tone it down please... the thread is already getting a

Unfortunately, not exactly.

Linus didn't want getrandom to return an error code / "to fail" in
that case, but to silently return CRNG-uninitialized /dev/urandom
data, to avoid user-space even working around the error code through
busy-loops.

I understand the rationale behind that, of course, and this is what
I've done so far in the V3 RFC.

Nonetheless, this _will_, for example, make systemd-random-seed(8)
save week seeds under /var/lib/systemd/random-seed, since the kernel
didn't inform it about such weakness at all..

The situation is so bad now, that it's more of "some user-space are
more equal than others".. Let's just at least admit this while
discussing the RFC patch in question.

thanks,
