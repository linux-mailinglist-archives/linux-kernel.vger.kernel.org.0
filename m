I'm just worried if people are going to complain about the IPI burst.
Although, I just tried it out before applying this patch, and there's
still a bit of a burst. Not sure why. I did:

# cat /proc/interrupts > /tmp/before; echo function > /debug/tracing/current_tracer; cat /proc/interrupts > /tmp/after
# cat /proc/interrupts > /tmp/before1; echo nop > /debug/tracing/current_tracer; cat /proc/interrupts > /tmp/after1

Before this patch:

# diff /tmp/before /tmp/after
< CAL:       2342       2347       2116       2175       2446       2030       2416       2222   Function call interrupts

(Just showing the function call interrupts)

There appears to be 120 IPIs sent to all CPUS for enabling function tracer.

# diff /tmp/before1 /tmp/after1
< CAL:       2462       2467       2236       2295       2446       2150       2536       2342   Function call interrupts

And 151 IPIs for disabling it.

After applying this patch:

# diff /tmp/before /tmp/after
< CAL:      66070      46620      59955      59236      68707      63397      61644      62742   Function call interrupts

We get 657 IPIs for enabling function tracer, and 661 for disabling it.
Funny how it's more on the disable than the enable with the patch but
the other way without it.

But still, we are going from 120 to 660 IPIs for every CPU. Not saying
it's a problem, but something that we should note. Someone (those that
don't like kernel interference) may complain.
