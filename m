A non-canonical #GP always has an error code of '0', but the reverse isn't
technically true.  And 32-bit mode obviously can't generate a non-canonical
address.

But practically speaking, since _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() should only be used for
reg<->mem instructions, the only way to get a #GP on a usercopy instruction
would be to corrupt the code itself or have a bad segment loaded in 32-bit
mode.  So qualifying the non-canonical message on '64-bit && !error_code'
is techncally more precise/correct, but likely meaningless in practice.
