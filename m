I'm not sure of this, but IMHO it is similarly because we need to
allocate the iova ranges from iova allocator first, so thread A (who's
going to unmap pages) and thread B (who's going to map new pages)
should never have collapsed regions if happening concurrently.  I'm
referring to intel_unmap() in which we won't free the iova region
before domain_unmap() completes (which should cover the whole process
of A1-A3) so the same iova range to be unmapped won't be allocated to
any new pages in some other thread.

There's also a hint in domain_unmap():

  /* we don't need lock here; nobody else touches the iova range */

Do you mean you have run the code with a 1st-level-supported IOMMU
hardware?  IMHO any data point would be good to be in the cover letter
as reference.

Is this an assumption of the allocator?  Could that change in the future?

IMHO that's not necessary if so, after all it's as simple as replacing
(!start_addr) with (start == 0 && end == END).  I see that in
domain_unmap() it has a similar check when freeing pgd:

  if (start_pfn == 0 && last_pfn == DOMAIN_MAX_PFN(domain->gaw))

Thanks,
