It is. We don't need more than one node that represents the physical
connector (and we should not have more than one node for that). And
actually, I was not mixing the OF graph ports and USB ports... I
think I should be talking about PHY instead of "port". That is
probable more clear.

My point is that every PHY that is connected to a Type-C connector
must still be represented with its own node in devicetree and ACPI. So
there still needs to be a node for the USB2 PHY, USB3 PHY, DisplayPort
PHY, etc., on top of the connector node. I got the picture that you
are proposing that we don't need those PHY nodes anymore since we have
the connector nodes, but maybe I misunderstood?

Well, we do need that to be documented, but do we really need to block
this series because of that? This driver does not depend on OF graph
yet.

The PHY nodes we must still always have. So the OF graph will always
describe the connection between the PHY and the connector, and the
connection between the PHY and the controller must be described
separately.

OK.
