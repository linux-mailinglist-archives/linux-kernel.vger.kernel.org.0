I think this is mostly orthogonal problem. E.g. for some syzbot bugs I
see fixes that also try to simply "shut up" the immediate
manifestation with whatever means, e.g. sprinkling some slinlocks. So
(1) it's not unique to atomics, (2) presence of READ/WRITE_ONCE will
make the reader aware of the fact that this runs concurrently with
something else, and then they may ask themselves why this runs
concurrently with something when the object is supposed to be private
to the thread, and then maybe they re-fix it properly. Whereas if it's
completely unmarked, nobody will even notice that this code accesses
the object concurrently with other code. So even if READ/WRITE_ONCE
was a wrong fix, it's still better to have it rather than not.
