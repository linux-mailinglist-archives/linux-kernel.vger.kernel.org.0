You can do that today with the ftrace facility, just like live patching
does. You register a ftrace_ops with the flag FTRACE_OPS_FL_IPMODIFY,
and your func will set the regs->ip to your bpf handler. When the
ftrace_ops->func returns, instead of going back to the called
function, it can jump to your bpf_handler. You can create a shadow stack
(like function graph tracer does) to save the return address for where
you bpf handler needs to return to. As your bpf_handler needs raw
access to the parameters, it may not even need the shadow stack because
it should know the function it is reading the parameters from.

If you still want the return address without the shadow stack, it
wouldn't be hard to add another ftrace_ops flag, that allows the
ftrace_ops to inject a return address to simulate a call function
before it jumps to the modified IP.

Having two different infrastructures modifying the first nop is going
to cause a huge nightmare to maintain. This is why live patching didn't
do it. I strongly suggested that you do not have bpf have its own
infrastructure.
