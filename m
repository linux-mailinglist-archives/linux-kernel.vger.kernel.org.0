PS: please, don't take that kind of stuff any further; right now all that
thing does is marshalling the arguments.  At that level it's just going
to be a headache while debugging that code.  Take it further (e.g.
play with calling do_move_mount() et.al. instead of using MS_MOVE) and
the headache will be ongoing, not just one-time.  "Just use ksys_...()
in init/*.c" prevented that kind of stuff; now that this policy no
longer holds, we'd better watch out for trouble in that area.

To quote the original patchset, "instead of pretending to be userspace,
... can be implemented using using in-kernel functions" and exact same
rationale would lead to a lot of trouble.  That's what I'm really
worried about; let's not go there.
