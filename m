Thank you for your patience!

Yes, I very well *do* understand that we need to split a huge pmd to 
walk the pte range, and I've never been against removing that 
conditional. What I've said is that it is pointless anyway, because 
we've already verified that the only path coming from the pmd_entry 
(with the patch applied) has the pmd *already split* and stable.

Your original patch does exactly the same!

So please let's move on from the splitting issue. We don't disagree 
here. The conditional is gone to never be resurrected.

Agreed.

Indeed.

Sure. I'm fine with this. So for next spin, I'll skip this patch, and do 
the positive value rework as part of the prerequisites for the huge page 
enablement. IIRC there is another user of positive values that should be 
trivial to fix.

Does that sound OK?

Thanks,

Thomas
