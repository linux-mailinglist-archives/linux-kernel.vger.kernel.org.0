First: thanks for all the effort you've put into this series!

I'm not sure we need to abstract away hypercalls and cpuid. I believe in
case of nested Xen all contacts to the L0 hypervisor should be done via
the L1 hypervisor. So we might need to issue some kind of passthrough
hypercall when e.g. granting a page to L0 dom0, but this should be
handled via the grant abstraction (events should be similar).

So IMO we should drop patches 2-5.
