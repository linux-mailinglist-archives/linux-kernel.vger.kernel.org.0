I've created this tracer with kernel tailoring in mind since the
tailoring process of e.g. undertaker heavily benefits from a more
precise set of input data.

A "oneshot" option for the function tracer would be a viable
possibility. However, this may add a lot of overhead (performance wise)
in comparison to my current approach? After all, the use case of my
tracer would be some sort of kernel activity monitoring during "normal
usage" in order to get a grasp of (hopefully) all required kernel
functions.

Also, there is no strong reason to add a new event type,
this was just a means of reducing the collected data (which may as well
be omitted since there is no real benefit).

My "oneshot tracer" actually collects and outputs every parent in order
to get a more thorough view on used kernel code. Therefore, I would
suggest to keep this functionality and maybe make it configurable
instead?

Yours sincerely,
Thomas
