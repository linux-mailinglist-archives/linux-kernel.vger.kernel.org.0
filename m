Yes, especially, the corner case which we need to find is hard to cover.

OK, so this is for what the instr_begin() and instr_end() ensure the
instrumentation safeness. Would you think this will also applied to
notrace functons? I mean, how can large this section be.

It seems there are several different aspect (or level), RCU idle,
kprobes recursive call(NOKPROBE), and ftrace recursive call(notrace).
Would the offlimit section include all of them or some specific cases?

I think some library code can be duplicated in the offlimit section if
needed. And stacktrace can also be a part of offlimit as like as a
"service" call from normal world, since usually, stacktrace is for
debugging.

I tried something like below. It needs a new set_memory_rw()
like function which can be called from int3 context.
