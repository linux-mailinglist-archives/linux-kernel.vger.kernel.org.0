From a memory management perspective, VMs are not at all like enclaves.
An enclave is an extension of its host, i.e. runs in the same address.
This isn't strictly necessary, e.g. an enclave could run in a sandbox
process, but even then the enclave will be running with the kernel's
standard page tables.

A VM is a essentially an opaque blob of data that gets loaded into memory.
KVM builds a completely different set of page tables for the VM, the VM
has it's own file system (or perhaps doesn't have a file system at all),
etc...  Ignoring Spectre and L1TF, the VM is contained to its own world.

There are a lot of ways for a userspace VMM to expose things beyond raw
memory, but doing so requires the appropriate permissions.

And practically speaking, all traditional VMs will effectively need RWX
memory, i.e. Qemu (or any other userspace VMM) would be required to have
EXECMEM permissions, which would be a net negative for security.

Please read through the RFC, I think it address a lot of your questions.
Hopefully that will help us avoid some thrash.
