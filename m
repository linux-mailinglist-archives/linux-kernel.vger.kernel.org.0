Now that I looked at it:
All kernel loads don't fail. If they fail we end up in the handler and
restore to init-state. So no need to reset `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx' in this
case. The variable is actually set to task's FPU state so resetting is
not required.
fpu__save() invokes copy_kernel_to_fpregs() (on older boxes) and by
resetting `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx' we would load it twice (in fpu__save()
and on return to userland).

So far I can tell, the only problematic case is the signal code because
here the state restore *may* fail and we *may* do it in two steps. The
error happens only if both `may' are true.

I was thinking about it. So the `read-FPU-state' function must be
invoked within the fpregs_lock() section. This could be easily
enforced. At fpregs_unlock() time `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx' must be NULL or
pointing to task's FPU.
My brain is fried for today so I'm sure if this is a sane approach. But
it might be a start.
