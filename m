but I disagree with you about what 'right' means.

in this context, for you "right" meant potentially breaking some users
and implement the best possible kernel design.

for me, it meant continue to obey at the agreed ioctl interface to not
disturb the users.

but as I said, since there is not a significant pool of fastrpc users,
breaking backward compatibility with the fastrpc library is not
important hence why I agree that removing the ioctl was the better
choice (on this particular case).

of course taking an extra refcount is functionally pointless. But that
was a design decision that imposed something on the user. and the kernel
can certainly work with that 'silly' design decision by tracking the
memory in the driver.

is the right thing to do to keep less than ideal designs in the kernel
to support agreed user interface? IMO it depends on the use case

to my eyes the design was obviously wrong, I never questioned
that...that was very clear when I started tracing the code.

perhaps, rather than work around it, I should have considered that
removing the ioctl wouldnt be a big deal to anyone.

so I would have send two patches instead of the one I sent you

1. fix leak (keep track of allocated dma buffers and make sure
everything is released on exit)

2. remove unnecessary ioctl warning users.

cmon, I did understand it before we engaged in this discussion :)

I would like to leave the discussion here if that is ok with you (I
clearly understand your POV but I feel I am not doing a good job at
sharing my thoughts...we can do that offline if you want)
