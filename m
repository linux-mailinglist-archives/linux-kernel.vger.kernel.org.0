Hi Thara,

Sorry for the delayed response.

If I try to clarify my point a little bit, my observation is really that
it's a shame to update the thermal stats often, but to not reflect that
in capacity_of().

So in fact there are two alternatives: 1) do the update only during LB
(which is what I suggested first) to avoid 'useless' work; or 2) reflect
the thermal pressure in the CPU capacity every time the thermal stats
are updated.

And thinking more about it, perhaps 2) is actually a better option? With
this we could try smaller decay periods than the LB interval (which is
most likely useless otherwise) and make sure the capacity considered
during wake-up is up-to-date. This should be a good thing for latency
sensitive tasks I think. (If you consider a task in the Android display
pipeline for example, it needs to run within 16ms or the frame is
missed. So, on wake-up, we'd like to know where the task can run fast
_now_, not according to the capacities the CPUs had 200ms ago or so).

Thoughts ?
Quentin
