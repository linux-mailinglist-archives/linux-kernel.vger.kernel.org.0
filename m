An approach where the "in_tracer" flag is tested and set by the instrumentation
(function tracer, kprobes, tracepoints) would work here. Let's say the beginning
of the int3 ISR is part of the code which is invisible to instrumentation, and
before we issue rcu_nmi_enter(), we handle the in_tracer flag:

rcu_nmi_enter();
 <int3>
    (recursion_ctx->in_tracer == false)
    set recursion_ctx->in_tracer = true
    do_int3() {
       rcu_nmi_enter();
         <int3>
            if (recursion_ctx->in_tracer == true)
                iret

We can change "in_tracer" for "in_breakpoint", "in_tracepoint" and
"in_function_trace" if we ever want to allow different types of instrumentation
to nest. I'm not sure whether this is useful or not through.

Thanks,

Mathieu
