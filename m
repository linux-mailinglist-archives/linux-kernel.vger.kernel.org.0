That's a good point, and this is what I tried at first when I started
to work on this problem. In my case INTEL_DSM_V18_SWITCH (fn=0x3) got
executed in the mmc sub-system, but without the regulator or DSDT
support the card did not get the proper voltage.

The DSDT on Intel Aero reference platform looks different here.
Currently I don't have it on hands, but would be able to look it up
next week.
