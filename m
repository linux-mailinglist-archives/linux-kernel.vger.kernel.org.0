You probably have figured all this out already, but I'll answer anyway.

The code I changed doesn't race with the error condition you were 
concerned about.  The two are independent, and it doesn't matter if the 
kill happens while the completion handler is running.

In the case my patch addresses, the resubmit does not fail.  Rather, it
succeeds but then the URB completes with a -EPROTO error.  The problem
is that the completion handler then resubmits the URB again, and it
completes again with the same error, right away, in a tight loop --
which prevents the CPU from executing any other code.  The way to fix
the problem is to break the loop by not resubmitting, which is what the
patch does.
