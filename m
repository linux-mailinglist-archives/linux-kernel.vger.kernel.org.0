Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] iommu/arm-smmu: Split pagetable support

This is part of an ongoing evolution for enabling split pagetable support for
arm-smmu. Previous versions can be found [1].

In the discussion for v2 Robin pointed out that this is a very Adreno specific
use case and that is exactly true. Not only do we want to configure and use a
pagetable in the TTBR1 space, we also want to configure the TTBR0 region but
not allocate a pagetable for it or touch it until the GPU hardware does so. As
much as I want it to be a generic concept it really isn't.

This revision leans into that idea. Most of the same io-pgtable code is there
but now it is wrapped as an Adreno GPU specific format that is selected by the
compatible string in the arm-smmu device.

Additionally, per Robin's suggestion we are skipping creating a TTBR0 pagetable
to save on wasted memory.

This isn't as clean as I would like it to be but I think that this is a better
direction than trying to pretend that the generic format would work.

I'm tempting fate by posting this and then taking some time off, but I wanted
to try to kick off a conversation or at least get some flames so I can try to
refine this again next week. Please take a look and give some advice on the
direction.
