Oh great, threats and power-plays.

Alexandre François Garreau:

I am not asking you as a friend to "please review my game, oh great 
one". I am demanding that you actually use the free-software you blindly 
criticize. You then make demands "give me direct link, stop saying 
things I don't like, etc". It is your offense against me that you libel 
me and my work because you disagree with my (correct) opinions.

[Turn on javascript and let sourceforge resolve whatever mirror it wants 
to give you the link from (their JS is free software).]

Software hacking is not "work". It is a hobby. I will not allow you 
people to dictate to me what I am to believe or not to believe; what I 
am to say and not to say. I do not go to your pointless conventions: I 
am an _Attorney_; I go to seminars on law, not on how to identify 
yourself to the authorities in exchange for no gain for yourself.

I do _not_ hold your conference organizers in high esteem: the entire 
point of these conferences is to identify the keyholders so as to bring 
pressure down upon them. Anyone that goes to these who has not all-ready 
been identified is a naive moron.

Additionally it allows outsiders, like yourself, who do not program, to 
set themselves up as gatekeepers to the "community".

Let me fill you in about how social-ostracization works:
1) First you have to have something I want, or the ability to take from 
me something I otherwise normally would have.
2) Second you have to be willing to give it to me.
3) Third the cost cannot be too prohibitive.

Fourth: You threaten to withhold that thing if I do not obey you 
regarding (whatever), and you threaten to make sure your fellows do the 
same.

However in this instance:
1) You will never give me what I want: (cute young girls as brides). 
Ever.
We are intractable enemies thusly, no further evaluation of the 
ladder-logic needed:
The only way I get what I want is if I defeat you/yours: you are simply 
an obstacle.

You withholding what you will never give equates to a benefit/detriment 
spread of quantum nullus.

Thus I have no reason to contemplate any of your demands.

What you are "withholding" is "philos with thine fellow hackers at a 
conference we, non-hackers, control". This is not something I want in 
the first place. The hackers that attend such conferences essentially 
submit to you people: they are fools. (And Yes: linus, socially, is a 
fool. A complete and utter fool, and is not generally respected. He is 
ruled by the women in his life, and they are used to control him)

RMS is respected for never giving in to demands.

Alexandre François Garreau:
Honestly: how old are you? You come to these mailing lists, you simply 
demand that others change the names of variables you don't like and 
"simplify" things, you give "helpful hints" about something we obviously 
allready know, as if you are a complete neophile to computers and mail 
software, and you do not have the presence of mind to realize that the 
same is not the case for all other contemporaneously-existant living 
beings. It's like you believe that there is
only YOU in existance; and as it's first principal, and WE /SURELY/ do 
not
posess any more knowlege than YOU on any particular subject.

You remind me of a friend of mine who discovered things once he joined a 
scam-
artist tech company, and then happily reported those "new tech 
discoveries" to
me: with ARROGANCE; these things I had been configuring and utilizing on 
my
servers well over a decade before.

Alexandre François Garreau:
Basically: you are a consumer who has no respect for the people who make 
the
things that you use: you feel entitled: even though you will never 
understand
how to create these things yourself. You feel entitled to make demands, 
entitled
to demand the progenitor bend to YOUR will, etc. You feel entitled to 
give your
libelous opinion on things you do not even have an opinion on (having 
never used
them)

-----

RMS: Once you said you wanted an Empire game in GNU.
My Work has such capabilities: you can build little towns and cities and 
take land with them, capture or destroy eachother, and all buildings 
have interiors. You can play as medevial or futuristic etc, it's all in 
3d, and all free-software.
