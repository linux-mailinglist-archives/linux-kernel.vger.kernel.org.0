The challenge is that - AIUI - in inline instrumentation, the compiler
doesn't generate calls to things like __asan_loadN and
__asan_storeN. Instead it uses -fasan-shadow-offset to compute the
checks, and only calls the __asan_report* family of functions if it
detects an issue. This also matches what I can observe with objdump
across outline and inline instrumentation settings.

This means that for this sort of thing to work we would need to either
drop back to out-of-line calls, or teach the compiler how to use a
nonlinear, NUMA aware mem-to-shadow mapping.

I'll document this a bit better in the next spin.

So unless I misunderstand the circumstances in which
check_memory_region_inline is used, this isn't going to help with inline
instrumentation.

Again, assuming I understand correctly that the compiler generates raw
IR->asm for these checks rather than calling out to a function, then I
don't think we get a way to intercept those checks. It's too late to do
anything at the __asan report stage because that will already have
accessed memory that's not set up properly.

If you try to boot this on a Power8 box it will panic and you'll have to
boot into another kernel from the bootloader. I don't think it's
avoidable without disabling inline instrumentation, but I'd love to be
proven wrong.

It's actually super easy to do simple boot tests with qemu, it works fine in TCG,
Michael's wiki page at
https://github.com/linuxppc/wiki/wiki/Booting-with-Qemu is very helpful.

I did this a lot in development.

My full commandline, fwiw, is:

qemu-system-ppc64  -m 8G -M pseries -cpu power9  -kernel ../out-3s-radix/vmlinux  -nographic -chardev stdio,id=charserial0,mux=on -device spapr-vty,chardev=charserial0,reg=0x30000000 -initrd ./rootfs-le.cpio.xz -mon chardev=charserial0,mode=readline -nodefaults -smp 4

Daniel
