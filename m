I'm just waiting for the system that messes up the TSC and doesn't have
HPET/PIT _at_all_ :-/

But yes, I get your point.

The doesn't stop on idle thing is CONSTANT_TSC, and that has been set
since Nehalem, and there are a metric ton of systems still failing due
to the described SMM 'feature'.

Perhaps we can go with TSC_KNOWN_FREQ, which relies on CPUID.15h to tell
us the actual TSC frequency, but I'm not sure all modern systems
actually fill out that leaf :/

The systems that completely got rid of the HPET/PIT pretty much must
fill that out, otherwise there's just no way we can recover the TSC
frequency.

I'm going to have to wait for Thomas to chime in though; I only
occasionally poke at this stuff ;-)
