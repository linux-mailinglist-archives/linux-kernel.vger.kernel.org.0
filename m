Sure, i will change.

Putting that indirection helped me automate making these kind of changes w/
cocci. As there were >150 instances of setup_irq and since "failed",
"request_irq()" were common, putting a %s indirection with the timer
name that changes in each instance, it was easy to take help of cocci
to automatically create it (though not fully).

Would you be okay to keep that indirection ?, if not , i will make the
changes manually.

Yes, as i mentioned in m86k patch (6/18) [1], i was uncomfortable w/ that
string, based on Finn's feedback, in v2, it was modified to,

        cascade: request_irq() failed

though still using %s indirection.

Yeah, i had felt it, the reason i went ahead that way was cocci could
automate that way for me for three-fourth of >150 instances making
things easy for me. Another reason was to reduce manual changes so as
to make it less error prone.

Seems you are against taking the easy route of taking cocci's help, in
that case, i will change as you suggest.

There was discussion on m68k (6/18) patch [2], but v2 series on
similar lines, not w.r.t flags, but mainly  w.r.t return value.
