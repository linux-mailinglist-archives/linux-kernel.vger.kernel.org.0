The physflat stuff is documented in the SDM and in the APIC code
(apic_flat_64.c):

static void physflat_init_apic_ldr(void)
{
        /*
         * LDR and DFR are not involved in physflat mode, rather:
         * "In physical destination mode, the destination processor is
         * specified by its local APIC ID [...]." (Intel SDM, 10.6.2.1)
         */
}

Why is LDR initialized in the bigsmp code? Probably histerical raisins and
I'm just too tired to consult the history git trees for an answer.

That's surely something we want to get rid off. But for sanity sake we
should clear LDR as well after understanding it completely.

Yeah. I know that KVM injects interrupts. Still that does not explain the
issue properly.

The point is that when the kdump kernel boots in the guest and uses logical
destination mode then it will overwrite LDR _BEFORE_ the local APIC timer
calibration takes place. So no, I'm not bying this. Just because it makes
your problem disappear does not mean it's the proper explanation.

That's the same text in diffferent form and not conclusive either.

Well, it's not an accurate technical description of the root cause either :)

Thanks,
