That's surprising, you're using u-boot isn't it? and the upstream device tr=

You're right, it might happen. The way I understand it you're bound to leav=
e
the GPU at it's lower frequency if you want to use those peripherals and fo=
r
them to be reliable. You could technically try to empirically fine tune the=
 CPU
thermal trip point so as to make sure the upstream kernel cpufreq downclock
always kicks in before videocore's one. I'd actually like to see someone tr=
y
that. However short of using an RT kernel It think you'll never be 100% sur=
e it
can never happen.

Nicolas
