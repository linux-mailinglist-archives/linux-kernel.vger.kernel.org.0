Hello Laks,
Agreed. The assumption is that integrity_kernel_read() function does
not return a value greater than the fourth parameter passed to it (i.e.
does not read more bytes from the file than the size of the buffer
passed to it). I tried to validate that this assumption was true by
following the code but felt I could not prove it with my current
knowledge of the code. If this assumption is not true then I believe
that any code change for this problem should go into a different
patch. 

Thank you.
