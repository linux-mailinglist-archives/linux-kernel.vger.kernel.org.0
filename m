FYI, it looks like your patch somehow got hit by your text editor (or
MUA's) line wrapping...

Shouldn't "reparenting" be used in this paragraph?

I suppose if a patch is getting dropped or modified that can
invalidate some of the testing (although it really depends on the
nature of what's being dropped or modified).  And if it's just adding
a Tested-by tag or a CVE number in the commit description, it's not
going to invalidate any testing.


As an aside, I wonder if git could pass down some kind of hint at "git
fetch" time that a particular branch is one that is subject to
frequent history rewriting, so it shouldn't be used as the basis for
further work (unless the developer is someone who is really good at
the "git rebase --onto ..." syntax).

Some maintainers will actually do a test merge and then run regression
tests on the result --- more than just a "it builds, ship it!"  :-)

It might also be useful to mention it might be useful to put the
commits which are needed to solve the dependency problem on its own
separate branch, based off of something like -rc2, and then each of
the trees which need the prerequisite commits can merge in that
branch.

BTW, this is another example where, if we couldn't figure this out in
advance, I might consider it worthwhile to separate out prerequisite
patches, and reparent them on top of -rc2, so that other trees don't
have to do a cross-merge which pulls in half of some other subsystem's
branch.  Rewriting history on one branch and reparenting the changes
so they are on their own branch might be a good tradeoff if it avoids
messy cross-merges on multiple other trees.  It also avoids this
problem:
