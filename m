This deserves a nice comment at the top.

Honestly I don't think slowing down a bit OOB access is critical as,
with recent software layers like UBI/UBIFS we do not access OOB only
that much. So here I would choose 2.

I am not sure to understand correctly what you mean. Please try to
write a nice comment and we'll see.
