The ANX7802/12/14/16 has a slave I2C bus that provides the interface to access
or control the chip from the AP. The I2C slave addresses used to control the
ANX7802/12/14/16 are 70h, 72h, 7Ah, 7Eh and 80h. Every address allows you to
access to different registers of the chip and AFAICS is not configurable.

I don't think these addresses should be configured via DT but for the driver itself.

My wild guess is that the ANX7808 has different addresses, but I don't have the
datasheet of this version.

Best regards,
 Enric
