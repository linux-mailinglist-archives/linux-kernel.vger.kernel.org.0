And "just page allocation and zeroing" overhead is the primary
motivation to keep the page in memory. It is a decision of the workload
to use MADV_FREE because chances are that this will speed things up. All
that with a contract that the memory goes away under memory pressure so
with a good workload/memory sizing you do not really lose that
optimization. Now you want to make decision on behalf of the consumer of
the MADV_FREE memory.

It is not. You have to explicitly request MAP_POPULATE to initialize
mmap.
