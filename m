Looking into soc_pcm_hw_params, I see dai_link hw_params ops happens=20
prior to=C2=A0 platform snd_soc_dai_driver hw_params ops.

So, PLL rate change thru asoc_utils_set_rate happens during sample rate=20
config of dai_link hw_params ops and during this time I2S will always be=20
in idle state.

Sameer, Please confirm.
