Alright.

What I can see is that filesystem was just stuck, rather than image became
corrupted, I guess the condition is not such bad, anyway, it's okay to just
revert compression support for now to keep fs stable.

Okay, compression support may increase stack usage during page writeback, it
shouldn't overflow the stack, otherwise it could cause panic in somewhere else,
but still can find any clue why this is related to compression support patch...

Not sure, maybe this issue is related to arm v7 architecture.
