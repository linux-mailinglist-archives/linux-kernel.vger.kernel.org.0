It's likely this is panel self-refresh going haywire.

    drm/i915: Enable PSR2 by default

    The support for PSR2 was polished, IGT tests for PSR2 was added and
    it was tested performing regular user workloads like browsing,
    editing documents and compiling Linux, so it is time to enable it by
    default and enjoy even more power-savings.

Temporary workaround would be to set i915.enable_psr=0
