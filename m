I hadn't noticed the use of __OPTIMIZE__ - indeed if __compiletime_assert
is no-op'd and you reach it then you won't have a build error - but you
may get uninitialised values instead.

Presumably the purpose of __OPTIMIZE__ in this case is to prevent getting
an undefined function error for the __compiletime_assert line, even though
it doesn't get called (when using a compiler that doesn't optimize out the
call to the unused function).

Why is the call to __get_user_bad not guarded in this way for when
__OPTIMIZE__ isn't set, i.e. why doesn't it suffer from the issue
that the following fixes?

c03567a8e8d5 ("include/linux/compiler.h: don't perform compiletime_assert with -O0")

Thanks, I've now read it. My suggestion arose from looking at existing
uses in the kernel - e.g. drivers/spi/spi-rockchip.c,
drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-ingenic.c, etc. I guess these types of uses
should use BUG or similar instead right?

Thanks for the example.

I completely agree.

Though please note that this issue isn't limited to -O0, it relates to
building without CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING - resulting in functions
marked as inline not always being inlined.

I'm interested to determine if there is a benefit for all the functions
I mentioned (there are more) to have the same name which may be something
other than BUILD_BUG.
