It would be good to get confirmation from Arm about this, since the TTL
extension doesn't have the dangerous 'Note' that the range ops do and it
wouldn't be difficult to ignore those bits in hardware where the system
doesn't support the hint for all agents (in comparison to upgrading range
ops to ALL, which may be unpalatable).
