Your email subject says "Question about...".  What is the question?

Also, given that your question concerns what happens when you write to
/sys/bus/pci/..., perhaps you should consider mailing it to some PCI
maintainers as well as to the USB maintainers.

Perhaps the reset was not meant to be used the way you are doing it.  
A more conservative approach would be to unbind xhci-hcd from the 
device before doing the reset and then rebind it afterward.
