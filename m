Thank you for your feedback. Just to be sure we are on the same pager, I
read commit a0be1db4304f like this:
1) virtio_pci_legacy needs to allocate the virtqueues so that the base
address fits 44 bits
2) if 64 bit dma is possible they set coherent_dma_mask to
  DMA_BIT_MASK(44) and dma_mask to DMA_BIT_MASK(64)
3) since the queues get allocated with coherent allocations 1) is
satisfied
4) when the streaming mappings see a buffer that is beyond
  DMA_BIT_MASK(44) then it has to treat it as not coherent memory
  and do the syncing magic (which isn't actually required, just
  a side effect of the workaround.

I'm actually trying to get virtio_ccw working nice with Protected
Virtualization (best think of encrypted memory). So the "data" path
is mostly the same as for virtio_pci.

But unlike virtio_pci_legacy we are perfectly fine with virtqueues at
an arbitrary address.

We can make
coherent_dma_mask == DMA_BIT_MASK(31) != dma_mask == DMA_BIT_MASK(64)
but that affects all dma coherent allocations and needlessly force
the virtio control structures into the  [0..2G] range. Furthermore this
whole issue has nothing to do with memory coherence. For ccw devices
memory at addresses above 2G is no less coherent for ccw devices than
memory at addresses below 2G.

I've already implemented a patch (see after the scissors line) that
takes a similar route as commit a0be1db4304f, but I consider that a
workaround at best. But if that is what the community wants... I have to
get the job done one way or the other.

Many thanks for your help and your time.

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] s390/cio: fix virtio-ccw DMA without PV

Commit 37db8985b211 ("s390/cio: add basic protected virtualization
support") breaks virtio-ccw devices with VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM for non
Protected Virtualization (PV) guests. The problem is that the dma_mask
of the ccw device, which is used by virtio core, gets changed from 64 to
31 bit, because some of the DMA allocations do require 31 bit
addressable memory. For PV the only drawback is that some of the virtio
structures must end up in ZONE_DMA because we have the bounce the
buffers mapped via DMA API anyway.

But for non PV guests we have a problem: because of the 31 bit mask
guests bigger than 2G are likely to try bouncing buffers. The swiotlb
however is only initialized for PV guests, because we don't want to
bounce anything for non PV guests. The first such map kills the guest.

Since the DMA API won't allow us to specify for each allocating whether
we need memory from ZONE_DMA (31 bit addressable) or any DMA capable
memory will do, let us abuse coherent_dma_mask (which is used for
allocations) to force allocating form ZONE_DMA while changing dma_mask
to DMA_BIT_MASK(64).
