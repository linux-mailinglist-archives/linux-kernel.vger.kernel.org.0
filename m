The problem is that there are no data dependencies between the different
variables. When a new datablock is being reserved, it is critical that
all other observers see that the tail_lpos moved forward _before_ any
other changes. _dataring_pop() uses an smp_rmb() to synchronize for
tail_lpos movement. This CPU is about to make some changes and may have
seen an updated tail_lpos. An smp_wmb() is useless if this is not the
CPU that performed that update. The full memory barrier ensures that all
other observers will see what this CPU sees before any of its future
changes are seen.

You suggest an alternative implementation below. I will address that
there.

I think my comments above address this.

My RFCv2 implemented it that way. The function was called data_reserve()
and it moved the head using cmpxchg_release(). For RFCv3 I changed to a
full memory barrier instead because using acquire/release here is a bit
messy. There are 2 different places where the acquire needed to be:

- In _dataring_pop() a load_acquire() of head_lpos would need to be
  _before_ loading of begin_lpos and next_lpos.

- In prb_iter_next_valid_entry() a load_acquire() of head_lpos would
  need to be at the beginning within the dataring_datablock_isvalid()
  check (mC).

If smp_mb() is too heavy to call for every printk(), then we can move to
acquire/release. The comments of fB list exactly what is synchronized
(and where).
