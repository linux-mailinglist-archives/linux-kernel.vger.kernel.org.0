Also, just to remind everyone why we really want this. Split lock is a
potent, unprivileged, DoS vector.

It works nicely across guests and everything. Furthermore no sane
software should have #AC, because RISC machines have been throwing
alignment checks on stupid crap like that forever.

And even on x86, where it 'works' it has been a performance nightmare
for pretty much ever since we lost the Front Side Bus or something like
that.
