I could be wrong, but I would guess that Marco is looking for something
a little less subjective and a little more specific.  ;-)

If smp_processor_id() returns the value already stored in ->cpu,
I believe that the default KCSAN setup refrains from complaining.

Which reminds me, I need to disable this in my RCU runs.  If I create a
bug that causes me to unknowingly access something that is supposed to
be CPU-private from the wrong CPU, I want to know about it.

On this I must defer to Marco.
