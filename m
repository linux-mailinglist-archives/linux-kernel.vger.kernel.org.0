So what?

So the consequence is that you defer the soft lockup detector
initialization instead of figuring out WHY this time difference
happens. There is no clock slowdown. The clock keeps ticking at the same
frequency so there must be something else which causes this deviation.

Maybe, but that's not a reasonable explanation.

Which fact? An observation is not a fact.

Sure, it's much easier to weaken debug features instead of actually
analyzing why there is a deviation between clocks which should not have
any deviation in the first place. Root cause analysis is overrrated and
just a pet pieve of grumpy old greybeards, right?

Andrew, please drop this hackery.

Thanks,
