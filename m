Yes.
Not sure about compiler, but hardware definitely can. And generally
one does not care if it's compiler or hardware.

No.
One puts memory barriers into synchronization primitives.
This equally affects memset's, memcpy's and in fact all normal stores.
Adding a memory barrier to every normal store is not the solution to
this. The memory barrier is done before publication of the memory. And
we already have smp_store_release for this. So if one doesn't publish
objects with a plain store (which breaks all possible rules anyways)
and uses a proper primitive, there is no problem.
