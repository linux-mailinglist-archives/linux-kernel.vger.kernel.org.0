Not sure what you mean, sorry.

No, GCC knows that a trap will never fall through.

You need to make a BUG_ENTRY so that it refers to the *following* trap
instruction, if you go this way.

#define MY_BUG_ENTRY(lab, flags)			\
	__asm__ __volatile__(				\
		".section __bug_table,\"aw\"\n"		\
		"2:\t" PPC_LONG "%4, %0\n"		\

		: : "i" (__FILE__), "i" (__LINE__),	\

		  "i" (sizeof(struct bug_entry)),	\
		  "i" (lab))

called as

#define BUG_ON(x) do {						\
	MY_BUG_ENTRY(&&lab, 0);					\
	lab: if (x)						\
		__builtin_trap();				\
} while (0)

not sure how reliable that works -- *if* it works, I just typed that in
without testing or anything -- but hopefully you get the idea.
