Hi Saranova,

I'll try to address the other portions of this email that I <snipped>
in my previous replies.

Please comment on my observation that was based on an IRQ for a device
will polling mode vs interrupt driven mode.  You described a different
case and did not address my comment.

Using a command line argument for this purpose just seems to be a
hack and bad architecture.

It also seems like an invitation to mis-configure a system (in other
words, increases the complexity and difficulty of properly configuring
and administering a system).

The is not a hard no (yet), but it will take some convincing for me
to accept the command line approach to add the feature, yet maintain
compatibility.  Please do not spend any time replying to this concern
yet - we will have plenty of time to discuss later if need be.
