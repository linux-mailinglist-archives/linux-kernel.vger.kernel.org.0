Thanks for going through the trouble of testing the thing.

But we still take out the isolcpus from the domain span before handing it
over to the scheduler:

	cpumask_or(dp, dp, b->effective_cpus);                               
	cpumask_and(dp, dp, housekeeping_cpumask(HK_FLAG_DOMAIN));

But...

...You're right, I've been misreading that as a '!is_sched_load_balance()'
condition ever since. Duh. So this condition will always catch cpusets than
only span outside the housekeeping domain, and my previous fixup will
catch newly-empty cpusets (due to HP). Perhaps it would've been cleaner to
merge the two, but as things stand this patch isn't needed (as you say).


I tried this out to really be sure (8 CPU SMP aarch64 qemu target):

  cd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset                                                                             
                                                                                                     
  mkdir cs1                                                                                            
  echo 1 > cs1/cpuset.cpu_exclusive                                                                    
  echo 0 > cs1/cpuset.mems                                                                             
  echo 0-4 > cs1/cpuset.cpus                                                                           
                                                                                                     
  mkdir cs2                                                                                            
  echo 1 > cs2/cpuset.cpu_exclusive                                                                    
  echo 0 > cs2/cpuset.mems                                                                             
  echo 5-7 > cs2/cpuset.cpus                                                                           
                                                                                                     
  echo 0 > cpuset.sched_load_balance

booted with
  
  isolcpus=6-7

It seems that creating a cpuset with CPUs only outside the housekeeping
domain is forbidden, so I'm creating cs2 with *one* CPU in the domain. When
I hotplug it out, nothing dies horribly:

  echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu5/online
  [   24.688145] CPU5: shutdown
  [   24.689438] psci: CPU5 killed.
  [   24.714168] allowed=0-4 effective=0-4 housekeeping=0-5
  [   24.714642] allowed=6-7 effective=6-7 housekeeping=0-5
  [   24.715416] CPU5 attaching NULL sched-domain.
