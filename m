Yes, so in this case we use dma_alloc_coherent().

With SEV, that gives us unencrypted pages. (Pages whose linear kernel 
map is marked unencrypted). With SME that (typcially) gives us encrypted 
pages. In both these cases, vm_get_page_prot() returns
an encrypted page protection, which lands in vma->vm_page_prot.

In the SEV case, we therefore need to modify the page protection to 
unencrypted. Hence we need to know whether we're running under SEV and 
therefore need to modify the protection. If not, the user-space PTE 
would incorrectly have the encryption flag set.
