The current "standard" solution for these situations is to replace
the problematic printk() with printk_deferred(). It would deffer
the console handling.

Of course, this is a whack a mole approach. The long term solution
is to deffer printk() by default. We have finally agreed on this
few weeks ago on Plumbers conference. It is going to be added
together with fully lockless log buffer hopefully soon. It will
be part of upstreaming Real-Time related code.

My understanding is that these are different code paths. Where each
code paths shows one existing lock ordering.

IMHO, it is possible that these code paths could never run in
parallel. I guess that lockdep is not able to distinguish
code paths that are called only during boot and others
that are called only in fully booted system. That said,
I am not sure if this is the case here.
