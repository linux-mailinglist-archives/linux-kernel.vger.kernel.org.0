You have to attach the controller to something at the other end of the
wire. A panel is only going to support 1 or a few wire formats, so you
do likely know because the panel knows. In the case that a panel
supports multiple wire formats, we do have some standard properties
there. See the LVDS panel binding.

For sure, there's always a software fallback. While we shouldn't let a
specific OS's requirements dictate DT bindings, I just wonder if some
of the configuration ends up always having to be set a certain way.
Clearly, you could be writing the whole software stack and do a fixed
configuration, but would you still be using DT at that point?
