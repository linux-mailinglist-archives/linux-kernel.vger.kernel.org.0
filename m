Why is this not implicit from clocks property and why is there need for
explicit mention of this ?

What happens if there's a cyclic dependency ? From hardware perspective,
cyclic dependency is quite feasible, so IMO it's hard to define this
property unambiguously.

And being optional, we need to deal with the absence of these, and if we
fallback to marking clock, regulators, pinctrl suppliers as depends-on,
this may end up redundant.

You may need to show examples(preferably with DTs in mainline just to
help understand it quickly and easily) that are beyond these standard
suppliers that are not implicit to add this property.
