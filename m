Worth adding that if we start strict with root (or capable user) only, relaxing
this to allow lowering the nice would still be possible in the future. But the
opposite is not true, we can't reverse the users ability to lower its
latency_nice value once we give it away.

Beside thinking a bit more about it now. If high latency_nice value means
cutting short the idle search for instance, does this prevent someone using
a lower latency nice to be aggressive in some code path to get higher
throughput?

I think this lack of clarity is what makes me think it's better to start
conservative and expand when needed.

My 2p :)
