Funny. I was just debating exactly this with Peter Ziljstra over IRC :)

Yes.

But, we really should check what aside of DoSemu is using this still. None
of my machines I checked have a single instance of ioperm()/iopl() usage.

So the real question is whether it's worth the trouble or if we are just
better off to copy if there is an actual user and the sequence count of the
bitmap is different than the one which was active last time.
