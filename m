What is usually used by old ARMv4 systems is OpenWrt or
OpenEmbedded. Those is the only build systems that reliably
produce a userspace for these things now, and it is also the
appropriate size for this kind of systems.

Personally I think it is a bad sign that this subarch and boards do
not have active OpenWrt support, they are routers after all (right?)
and any active use of networking equipment should use a recent
userspace as well, given all the security bugs that popped up over
the years.

With IXP4xx, Gemini and EP93xx we have found active users and
companies selling the chips and reference designs and even
recommending it for new products (!) at times.  If this is not the
case with KS8695 and no hobbyists are willing to submit it
to OpenWrt and modernize it to use device tree I think it should be
deleted from the kernel.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
