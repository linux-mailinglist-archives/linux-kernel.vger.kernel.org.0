Yes, but (see below) ...

Only in the sense that writing to /proc/scsi/device_info changes the
way the SCSI mid-level handles the identified device. So that is
in common with, and hence the same relation as,  sd, sr, st, ses, etc
have with the identified device (e.g. a specialized USB dongle).


Example of use of /proc/scsi/scsi

$ cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
   Vendor: Linux    Model: scsi_debug       Rev: 0188
   Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI  SCSI revision: 07
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 01
   Vendor: Linux    Model: scsi_debug       Rev: 0188
   Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI  SCSI revision: 07
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 02
   Vendor: Linux    Model: scsi_debug       Rev: 0188
   Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI  SCSI revision: 07

Which can be replaced by:

$ lsscsi
[0:0:0:0]    disk    Linux    scsi_debug       0188  /dev/sda
[0:0:0:1]    disk    Linux    scsi_debug       0188  /dev/sdb
[0:0:0:2]    disk    Linux    scsi_debug       0188  /dev/sdc
[N:0:1:1]    disk    INTEL SSDPEKKF256G7L__1                    /dev/nvme0n1

Or if one really likes the "classic" look:

$ lsscsi -c
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Target: 00 Lun: 00
   Vendor: Linux    Model: scsi_debug       Rev: 0188

   Vendor: Linux    Model: scsi_debug       Rev: 0188
   Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 07

   Vendor: Linux    Model: scsi_debug       Rev: 0188
   Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 07


Now looking at /proc/scsi/device_info

IMO unless there is a replacement for /proc/scsi/device_info
then your patch should not go ahead . If it does, any reasonable
distro should override it.

$ cat /proc/scsi/device_info
'Aashima' 'IMAGERY 2400SP' 0x1
'CHINON' 'CD-ROM CDS-431' 0x1
'CHINON' 'CD-ROM CDS-535' 0x1
'DENON' 'DRD-25X' 0x1
...
'XYRATEX' 'RS' 0x240
'Zzyzx' 'RocketStor 500S' 0x40
'Zzyzx' 'RocketStor 2000' 0x40


That is a black (or quirks) list that can be added to by writing an
entry to /proc/scsi/device_info . So if a user has a device that needs
one of those quirks defined to stop their system locking up when a
device of that type is plugged in, and the distro or some app (say,
that needs that device) knows about that, then it would be sad if
/proc/scsi/device_info was missing due to the changed default that is
being proposed.

The word "legacy" *** is thrown around a bit too often. It is not
legacy if there is no replacement for that functionality.

*** I'm assuming "aging feature" is a softer form of "legacy feature".
     "Classic" may be going too far the other way from "aged" and
     "legacy".
