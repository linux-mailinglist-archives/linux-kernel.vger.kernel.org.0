Right, there is no version in clone3. size = version. I view this as
a 1:1 lookup.

You cannot trust user for argsz. the size to be copied from user must
be based on knowledge in kernel. That is why we have this version to
size lookup.

In VFIO, the size to copy is based on knowledge of each VFIO UAPI
structures and VFIO flags. But here the flags are IOMMU UAPI flags. As
you pointed out in another thread, VFIO is one user.
