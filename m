+Intel(R) Active Management Technology (Intel AMT)
+=================================================
+
+Prominent usage of the Intel ME Interface is to communicate with Intel(R)
+Active Management Technology (Intel AMT) implemented in firmware running on
+the Intel ME.
+
+Intel AMT provides the ability to manage a host remotely out-of-band (OOB)
+even when the operating system running on the host processor has crashed or
+is in a sleep state.
+
+Some examples of Intel AMT usage are:
+   - Monitoring hardware state and platform components
+   - Remote power off/on (useful for green computing or overnight IT
+     maintenance)
+   - OS updates
+   - Storage of useful platform information such as software assets
+   - Built-in hardware KVM
+   - Selective network isolation of Ethernet and IP protocol flows based
+     on policies set by a remote management console
+   - IDE device redirection from remote management console
+
+Intel AMT (OOB) communication is based on SOAP (deprecated
+starting with Release 6.0) over HTTP/S or WS-Management protocol over
+HTTP/S that are received from a remote management console application.
+
+For more information about Intel AMT:
+http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide
+
+
+Intel AMT Applications
+======================
+
+	1) Intel Local Management Service (Intel LMS)
+
+	   Applications running locally on the platform communicate with Intel AMT Release
+	   2.0 and later releases in the same way that network applications do via SOAP
+	   over HTTP (deprecated starting with Release 6.0) or with WS-Management over
+	   SOAP over HTTP. This means that some Intel AMT features can be accessed from a
+	   local application using the same network interface as a remote application
+	   communicating with Intel AMT over the network.
+
+	   When a local application sends a message addressed to the local Intel AMT host
+	   name, the Intel LMS, which listens for traffic directed to the host name,
+	   intercepts the message and routes it to the Intel MEI.
+	   For more information:
+	   http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide
+	   Under "About Intel AMT" => "Local Access"
+
+	   For downloading Intel LMS:
+	   http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-the-latest-intel-amt-open-source-drivers/
+
+	   The Intel LMS opens a connection using the Intel MEI driver to the Intel LMS
+	   firmware feature using a defined UUID and then communicates with the feature
+	   using a protocol called Intel AMT Port Forwarding Protocol (Intel APF protocol).
+	   The protocol is used to maintain multiple sessions with Intel AMT from a
+	   single application.
+
+	   See the protocol specification in the Intel AMT Software Development Kit (SDK)
+	   http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide
+	   Under "SDK Resources" => "Intel(R) vPro(TM) Gateway (MPS)"
+	   => "Information for Intel(R) vPro(TM) Gateway Developers"
+	   => "Description of the Intel AMT Port Forwarding (APF) Protocol"
+
+	2) Intel AMT Remote configuration using a Local Agent
+
+	   A Local Agent enables IT personnel to configure Intel AMT out-of-the-box
+	   without requiring installing additional data to enable setup. The remote
+	   configuration process may involve an ISV-developed remote configuration
+	   agent that runs on the host.
+	   For more information:
+	   http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide
+	   Under "Setup and Configuration of Intel AMT" =>
+	   "SDK Tools Supporting Setup and Configuration" =>
+	   "Using the Local Agent Sample"
+
+	   An open source Intel AMT configuration utility,	implementing a local agent
+	   that accesses the Intel MEI driver, can be found here:
+	   http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-the-latest-intel-amt-open-source-drivers/

+
+Intel AMT OS Health Watchdog
+============================
+
+The Intel AMT Watchdog is an OS Health (Hang/Crash) watchdog.
+Whenever the OS hangs or crashes, Intel AMT will send an event
+to any subscriber to this event. This mechanism means that
+IT knows when a platform crashes even when there is a hard failure on the host.
+
+The Intel AMT Watchdog is composed of two parts:
+	1) Firmware feature - receives the heartbeats
+	   and sends an event when the heartbeats stop.
+	2) Intel MEI iAMT watchdog driver - connects to the watchdog feature,
+	   configures the watchdog and sends the heartbeats.
+
+The Intel iAMT watchdog MEI driver uses the kernel watchdog API to configure
+the Intel AMT Watchdog and to send heartbeats to it. The default timeout of the
+watchdog is 120 seconds.
+
+If the Intel AMT is not enabled in the firmware then the watchdog client won't enumerate
+on the me client bus and watchdog devices won't be exposed.
