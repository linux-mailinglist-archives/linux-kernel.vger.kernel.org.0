Hi Heitor,

With your very detailed explanation I come to understand why people
cares about performance impact of pririty_stats. In the case of system
monitoring, how long priority_stats returns is less important than
overall system throughput.

Yes I agree with your opinion and the benchmark chart makes me confident
with the original patch. I will add this patch to v5.4 window with
tested-by: Heitor Alves de Siqueira <halves@canonical.com>

Thanks for your detailed information. And thanks for Shile Zhang
originally composing this patch.
