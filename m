Yep, the risk that Jean-Philippe mentions is real, the IGD device has
the stolen memory addresses latched into the hardware and we're unable
to change that.  What we try to do now is trap page table writes to the
device and translate them to a VM allocated stolen memory range, which
is sufficient for getting a BIOS splash screen, but we really want to
assume that the OS level driver just doesn't use the stolen memory
range.  There was a time when it seemed like we could assume the Intel
drivers were heading in that direction, but it seems that's no longer
an actual goal.  To fully support IGD assignment in a way that isn't as
fragile as it is today, we'd want to re-export the RMRR out to
userspace so that QEMU could identity map it into the VM address
space.  That's not trivial, it's only one of several issues around
IGD assignment, and we've got GVT-g (Intel vGPUs) now that don't impose
these requirements, so motivation to tackle the issue is somewhat
reduced.

With the changes here, we might want vfio to issue a warning when one
of these relaxed reserved regions is ignored and we'd probably want a
module option to opt-in to strict enforcement, where downstreams that
don't claim to support IGD assignment might enforce this by default.
Thanks,

Alex
