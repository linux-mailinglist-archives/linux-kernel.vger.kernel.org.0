I think there's also `-mincoming-stack-boundary=`.

Which is hard to automate and easy to forget.  Likely a large diff to fix today.

The kernel would generally like to support GCC 4.9+.

There's plenty of different ways to keep layering on duct tape and
bailing wire to support differing ABIs, but that's just adding
technical debt that will have to be repaid one day.  That's why the
cleanest solution IMO is mark the driver broken for old toolchains,
and use a code-base-consistent stack alignment.  Bending over
backwards to support old toolchains means accepting stack alignment
mismatches, which is in the "unspecified behavior" ring of the
"undefined behavior" Venn diagram.  I have the same opinion on relying
on explicitly undefined behavior.

I'll send patches for fixing up Clang, but please consider my strong
advice to generally avoid stack alignment mismatches, regardless of
compiler.
