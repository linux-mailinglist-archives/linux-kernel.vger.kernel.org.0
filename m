I think you noticed what I was trying to do.

Yes, my work for cleaning 'inline' was initially motivated
by the 'asm inline' of GCC 9.

The ultimate goal is to stop macrofying 'inline', but
I am not sure whether or not it is achievable.

Just in care you are interested, this started from this thread:

If interested, my prototype-patch is here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/12/13/212

I implemented the feature test in Kconfig.

config CC_HAS_ASM_INLINE
    def_bool $(success,echo 'void foo(void) { asm inline (""); }' |
$(CC) -x c - -c -o /dev/null)

I am also fine with checking it by version
since we know GCC 9 started supporting it.

The exported headers must use '__inline__' instead of 'inline':
This is now compile-tested.
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.3-rc6/usr/include/Makefile#L5


At this moment, 'inline' is replaced with '__inline__' with sed:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v5.3-rc6/scripts/headers_install.sh#L37

But, I'd like to reduce the sed patterns in the future.



I think using '__inline' for asm_inlie will be OK.

I want to get rid of always_inline.

My commit  9012d011660ea5cf2a623e1de207a2bc0ca6936d
is the first step towards the goal.
All architectures support CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING,
and it is stable up to now, I think.

Next, set CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=y forcibly,
and lastly, remove CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING and always_inline
entirely.

Probably we can get rid of this too.

Yes.
