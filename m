Internally, we have fix-up multiple corner cases about the late 
microcode loading. We have written some code to handle new features 
showing up but we know they are a bunch of hacks (for sure it lacks of 
different checks that needs to be done before using the new features). I 
am going to take Thomas' suggestion and work on an RFC series.
