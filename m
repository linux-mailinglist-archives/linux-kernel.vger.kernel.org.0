Probably good to be explicit that this has been achieved by combining
the disabling the preemption and taking the spin lock while the
ne_fit_preload_node is checked resp. repopulated, right?

by populating the per cpu preload pointer under the vmap_area_lock.
This implies that at least each caller which has done the preallocation
will not fallback to an atomic allocation later. It is possible that the
preallocation would be pointless or that no preallocation is done
because of the race but your data shows that this is really rare.
