Hm yeah good idea, I'll add that to the next version.

Ime these sparse annotations are pretty useless because too inflexible. I
tend to use runtime locking checks based on lockdep. Those are more
accurate, and work even when the place the lock is taken is very far away
from where you're checking, without having to annoate all functions in
between. We need that for something like console_lock which is a very big
lock. Only downside is that only paths you hit at runtime are checked.
