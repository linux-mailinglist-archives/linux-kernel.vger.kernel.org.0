We can raise the bar and force a 1.7 or even 1.8 (Fedora 30 comes
with version 1.8.4), but I would prefer to keep support older versions,
at least while we don't depend on some new features introduced after
the version we're using, and while our extensions won't require a major
rework due to a new version.

There is a flag to cleanup the warning about a file not included at
a TOC tree (:orphan:), but it will still try to parse it. There's also
a conf.py way of doing it. For example, you can exclude an entire dir:

	exclude_patterns = ['includes/*.rst']

But using exclude_patterns will likely be too messy.

Yeah, this is, IMHO, a very bad behavior.
