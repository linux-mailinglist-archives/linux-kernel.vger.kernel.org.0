That's the rcu misnesting, which it looks like we can allow with the IPI-to-
self; I was asking about the other two.  I suppose if we really need to, we
could work around preempt_disable()/local_irq_disable()/preempt_enable()/
local_irq_enable() by having preempt_enable() do an IPI-to-self if
need_resched is set and IRQs are disabled.  The RT local_bh_disable()
atomic/non-atomic misnesting would be more difficult, but I don't think
impossible.  I've got lazy migrate disable working (initially as an attempt
to deal with misnesting but it turned out to give a huge speedup as well;
will send as soon as I take care of a loose end in the deadline scheduler);
it's possible that something similar could be done with the softirq lock
(and given that I saw a slowdown when that lock was introduced, it may also
be worth doing just for performance).

BTW, it's not clear to me whether the failure Sebastian saw was due to the
bare irq disabled version, which was what I was talking about prohibiting
(he didn't show the context that was interrupted).  The version where
preempt is disabled (with or without irqs being disabled inside the preempt
disabled region) definitely happens and is what I was trying to address with
patch 3/4.
