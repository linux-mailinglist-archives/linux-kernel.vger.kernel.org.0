I'm sorry, I don't see the benefit of that.  Can you elaborate on why 
you think that u8 * is a better type?

Sure, its an arbitrary byte stream from the perspective of the bus, but 
to the client, 99% of the time its going to have some structure.

In the call back, the first thing the client is likely to do is:
struct my_struct *s = buf_addr;

This works great when its a void *.  If buf_addr is a u8 *, that's not 
valid, and will result in a compiler error (at-least per gcc 5.4.0).
With u8 *, the client has to do:
struct my_struct *s = (struct my_struct *)buf_addr;

I don't see a benefit to u8 * over void * in this case.

The only possibly benefit I might see is if the client wants to use 
buf_addr as an array to poke into it and maybe check a magic number, but 
that assumes said magic number is a u8.  Otherwise the client has to do 
an explicit cast.  It seems like such a small amount of the time that 
usecase would be valid, that its not worth it to cater to it.

rpmsg, as one example, does the exact same thing where the received 
buffer is a void *, and there is a size parameter.
