Hi Maxime,

thanks for having a look!

Does that actually work? I dimly remember checking our sunxi driver a while ago and I wasn't sure that would be functional there.

True.

Ah, yeah, makes sense, thanks for the pointer.

I was a bit reluctant to do this:
First there does not seem to be any good documentation about it, neither in the official DT spec nor in dtc, even though I think I understand what it does ;-)
Second it seems to break in U-Boot atm. Looks like applying your dtc patch fixes that, though. Do you know if U-Boot allows cherry-picking dtc patches? If yes, I could post your patch.

But more importantly: what are the guidelines for using this tag? I understand the desire to provide every possible pin description on one hand, but wanting to avoid having *all of them* in *each* .dtb on the other.
But how does this play along with overlays? Shouldn't at least those interface pins that are exposed on headers stay in each .dtb? Can we actually make this decision in the SoC .dtsi file?
And should there be a dtc command line option to ignore those tags, or even to apply this tag (virtually) to every node?

Cheers,
Andre.
