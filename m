As reported in [1], updating the Dell TB16 firmware using a *Dell* 
laptop (with updated firmware and Thunderbolt drivers) and Dell’s 
Microsoft Windows update utility, the firmware parts below were updated, 
everything seems to work now.

MST1                 3.10.002    3.12.002
MST2                 3.10.002    3.12.002
ASM USB 3.0 Cntlr    10.11.23    10.11.A9
Dock NVM             00.00.16    00.00.27

Mathias, can you please confirm, and maybe also approach ASMedia from 
Intel to ask them to improve the situation?

Can the Linux kernel (or some user space) carry a list of non-working 
firmware versions, and output a warning, that a firmware update is needed?


Kind regards,

Paul
