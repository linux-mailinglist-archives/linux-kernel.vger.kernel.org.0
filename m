This is not true. ioperm() and iopl() have identical thread semantics.
I think what you=E2=80=99re seeing is that you can set iopl(3) early withou=
t
knowing which port range to request. You could alternatively set
ioperm() early and ask for a very wide range.  In principle, we could
make ioperm() be per thread, but I=E2=80=99m not sure we should add that ki=
nd
of complexity to support a mostly obsolete use case like this.

There's actually an argument to be made that per-mm ioperm would be
easier to handle in the kernel than per-task due to the vagaries of
KPTI.

All this being said, what are the actual performance implications of
write() to /sys/.../resource0?  Off the top of my head, I would guess
that the actual OUTB or OUTL instruction itself is incredibly slow due
to being trapped and emulated and that virtio-legacy hypervisors
aren't particularly fast to begin with and that, as a result, the
write() might not actually matter that much.

Done, with the new version of virtio :)
