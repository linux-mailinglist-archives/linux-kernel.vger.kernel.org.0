Yeah, I forgot about the .o file.  Something like that would probably
work.  The ordering seems a bit funny to me.  Another possibly more
readable variation would be:

  objtool check [check opts] + orc generate [orc opts] + mcount record [mcount opts] -- foo.o [bar.o]

or, just use '--' as a generic separator which can be used to separate
subcommands or file names.

  objtool check [check opts] -- orc generate [orc opts] -- mcount record [mcount opts] -- foo.o [bar.o]

I kind of like that.  But I think any of these variations would probably
work.
