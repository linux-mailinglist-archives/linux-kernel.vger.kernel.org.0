activities of the partnership consist of the practice of law.
...

corporation or association authorized to practice law for a profit, if:

(1) a nonlawyer owns any interest therein, except that a fiduciary 
representative of the estate of a lawyer may hold the stock or interest 
of the lawyer for a reasonable time during administration;

(2) a nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof or occupies 
the position of similar responsibility in any form of association other 
than a corporation ; or

judgment of a lawyer.

How about you shut you fucking mouth about professions you are not 
involved in?

Free licenses are revocable. They are simply permission and not backed 
by any bargained-for consideration. Weather you like it or not, Weather 
it gets you "mad" or not.
