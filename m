This patch looks good to me, with this patch, the bug '6d390e4b5d48 
("locks: fix a potential use-after-free problem when wakeup a waiter")' 
describes won't happen again. Actually, I find that syzkaller has report 
this bug before[1], and the log of it can help us to reproduce it with 
some latency in __locks_wake_up_blocks!

Also, some ltp testcases describes in [2] pass too with the patch!

For performance test, I have try to understand will-it-scale/lkp, but it 
seem a little complex to me, and may need some more time. So, Rong Chen, 
can you help to do this? Or the results may come a little later...

Thanks,
