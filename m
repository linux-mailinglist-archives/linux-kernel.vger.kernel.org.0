Hi Emil,

thank you for your comments.

Not yet. I added this API because I couldn't figure out a way to do that in KMS. What I need is some way for userspace to tell the driver parameters for the display refresh (driving waveforms, refresh speed etc.) on a frame-by-frame basis. These parameters depend on ambient temperature and the displayed content. One has to trade off speed, ghosting and the number of possible partial refreshes until next full one.

Usually, epaper display refresh all pixels at once like an LCD would. This takes about 15s of flickering for b/w/red displays. Since they're bistable, they can also only physically refresh part of the area though. The reason for not having that on-by-default is that epaper partial refresh is really tricky. If you refresh the same area partially a few times, charge builds up, image quality degrades and the picture starts bleeding. If you refresh the same area partially all the time and don't do enough full refresh cycles to balance charges again, eventually the display is going to get permanent burn-in. I think partial refresh should be supported by a driver like this since it's a good tool to alleviate the enormous full refresh times.

For partial hardware refresh you have to customize all these values and the waveform LUTs depending on the displayed content. For example you might want a LUT specifying more inversion cycles for text display to reduce ghosting, or one with less cycles but higher voltages for some spinning loading animation to reduce flickering. If you are displaying a loading bar you might be able to get away with a high drive strength since you know it's going to be done in a few frames, but if you display e.g. a text console you might want to reduce drive strength to do as many partial updates as possible before the next full refresh, to reduce flicker. 

I think what one would like to do from userspace here is along the lines of:
* set voltages depending on content
* set waveforms depending on content
* write framebuffer
* (optional) trigger partial refresh of affected areas

You can get the display up and running with some default values and the factory-programmed OTP LUTs using full hardware refresh, but if you try partial hardware refresh with those you get a irrecognizable mess.

I agree with that. FWIW, in this draft these properties are exposed through a DRM_ROOT_ONLY ioctl.

On init they are loaded from dt, but they can be overwritten via ioctl. This would be necessary for anything using the display's partial hardware refresh feature and might change frame-by-frame.

I had a look around, and I found something in uapi/drm/drm_mode.h for color LUTs. This isn't color LUTs though. The vendor should really have called them "waveform tables". They basically contain a list of voltage levels a pixel transitioning white-black, white-red etc. should be driven at. The format seems to be standardized across different driver chips, but I'd really treat them as device-dependent binary blobs since for some chips they're not even specified and there's no guarantee the format won't suddenly change for some new chip.

I do already have support for that. The partial_update_en flag here controls whether the partial hardware refresh is used to implement that. The force_full_refresh thing would be useful to do the periodic (every 10hrs) refresh required by the display's specs without having to re-render the content.
