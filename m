Been there, done that!  ;-)

My thought is to send a pull request for the commits up to but not
including this patch, allowing ample development and testing time for
the fix.  My concern with sending this, even with a fix, is that any
further bugs might cast a shadow on the whole series, further slowing
acceptance into mainline.

Fair enough?
