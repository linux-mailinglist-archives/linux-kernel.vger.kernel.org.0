Yeah, some documentation would be good.

In most cases it's desired to move the timer over. Assume you have a
network interrupt moving from one cpu to the other and then the tcp timers
would stay on the old cpu forever. So you'd pay the remote access price
every time you touch it and if it fires the callback is pretty much
guaranteed to be cache cold.

That's fine. It just wants to make sure that the timer is not queued on a
remote CPU if NOHZ is active. That gives them a serialization guarantee of
the network softirq vs. the timer softirq so they can spare some locking
stuff.
