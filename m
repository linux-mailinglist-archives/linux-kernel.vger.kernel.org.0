Hmm...maybe this isn't what I am looking for then. I am interested in
the problem of figuring out what dependencies I need to select to turn
on a desired config symbol (which is obviously a separate issue), and
I am interested in associating symbols with a config symbol and then
ensuring that symbol is exercised. Basically, I want a way to make
sure my tests actually get run without a human looking at them; I feel
like what you are working on might help with this latter issue, but I
am not 100% sure. It sounds like it is not your primary goal in any
case.

Ooo, looks like I should take a look at that.
