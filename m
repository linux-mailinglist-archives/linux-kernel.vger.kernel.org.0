I admit my information is rather dated, but I'm pretty sure that at
least some and possibly all TXT implementations solve this more
directly.  In particular, as I understand it, when you TXT-launch
anything, a nonvolatile flag in the chipset is set.  On reboot, the
chipset will not allow access to memory *at all* until an
authenticated code module wipes memory and clears that flag.

If your computer advertises TXT support but is missing that ACM, you
are SOL.  I learned about this when I bricked my old Lenovo laptop. As
far as I can tell, the flag was set, but the Lenovo BIOS didn't know
how to wipe memory.  Whoops!

sting that we hibernate the whole running system to memory (more like kexec=
 jump than hibernate) and authenticated-encrypt the whole thing (including =
user memory) with a PCR-sealed key. We jump to a stub that zaps PCRs does E=
FI calls. Then we re-launch and decrypt memory.

Exactly.  I would hope that performing a second secure launch would
reproduce the same post-launch PCRs as the first launch.  If the
kernel were wise enough to record all PCR extensions, it could replay
them.

(I can imagine an alternate universe in which the PCR extension used a
more clever algorithm that allowed log-time fast forwarding.  As far
as I know, this is not currently the case.)

In any case, I'm kind of with Daniel here.  We survived for quite a
long time without EFI variables at all.  The ability to write them is
nice, and we certainly need some way, however awkward, to write them
on rare occasions, but I don't think we really need painless runtime
writes to EFI variables.
