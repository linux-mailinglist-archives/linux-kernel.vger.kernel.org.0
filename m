There is a boot splash on the Nexus 5 and that may explain a behavior
that I observed. I attempted to add reset GPIO support to the simple
panel driver and the screen will clear but nothing will come on the
screen after a hard reset, even on 4.17. To be sure, I got the timing
information for how long to leave the GPIO high and low from the
downstream MSM 3.4 sources. That's when I had a script port all of the
~400 panel on commands in the downstream device tree to a new panel
driver.

With the latest kernel kernel having a delay showing the console text,
I observe a brief second where the boot splash is shown along with the
startup text from Linux. A full refresh is performed and the boot
splash goes away. I don't see this with the 4.17 kernel; perhaps maybe
the full refresh occurs quick enough that its not noticeable.

Can you point me to where the interconnect API is in the downstream
MSM 3.4 sources? https://github.com/AICP/kernel_lge_hammerhead
It looks like its in drivers/interconnect/ in the upstream sources.
