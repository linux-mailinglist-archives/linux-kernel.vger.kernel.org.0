I think the original patch re-enabling the rcu_irq_enter/exit_irqson() is a
tracepoint band-aid over what should actually been fixed within perf instead.

Perf should not do rcu_read_lock/unlock()/synchronize_rcu(), but rather use
tracepoint_synchronize_unregister() to match the read-side provided by
tracepoints.

If perf can then just rely on the underlying synchronization provided by each
instrumentation providers (tracepoint, kprobe, ...) and not explicitly add its own
unneeded synchronization on top (e.g. rcu_read_lock/unlock), then it should simplify
all this.

As Paul noted, SRCU is the exception to the "RCU watching".

Introducing SRCU was done to simplify handling of rcuidle, thus removing some
significant overhead that has been noticed due to use of rcu_irq_enter/exit_irqson().

There is another longer-term goal in adding SRCU-synchronized tracepoints: adding
the ability to create tracepoint probes which will be allowed to handle page
faults properly. This is very relevant for the syscall tracepoints reading the
system call parameters from user-space. Currently, we are stuck with sub par
hacks such as filling the missing data with zeroes. Usually nobody notices because
most syscall arguments are typically hot in the page cache, but it is still fragile.

I'd very much prefer see commits moving syscall tracepoints to use of SRCU
(without preempt disable around the tracepoint calls) rather than a commit removing
tracepoint SRCU use because of something that needs to be fixed within perf.

Thanks,

Mathieu
