Yes, it's a new feature, so perf/core branch is OK. Thanks! :)

BTW, v3 is old, I just post v5 according to Jiri's comments.

In summary, I have some patch series waiting but I think they can be in 
perf/core.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/2/83
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/14/136
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/19/1274

Following is a fix, maybe it can be in perf/urgent.

"perf stat: Align the output for interval aggregation mode"
