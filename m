In Android we have a userspace lmkd process which polls for PSI events
and after they get triggered we check several metrics to determine if
we should kill anything. I believe Facebook has a similar userspace
process called oomd which as I heard is a more configurable rule
engine which also uses PSI and configurable rules to make kill
decisions. I've spent considerable time experimenting with different
metrics and thrashing is definitely one of the most useful ones.

I'm guessing one quarter is a guesstimate here and needs experimentation?

Just wondering, why do you consider only inactive list here? The
complete workingset is active list + non-idle part of inactive list
isn't it? In my latest experiments I was using configurable percentage
of the active+inactive lists as a threshold to declare we are
thrashing and if thrashing continues after we kill that percentage
starts decaying which results in an earlier next kill (if interested
in details see https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/core/+/1041778/14/lmkd/lmkd.c#1968).
I'm also using existing WORKINGSET_REFAULT node_stat_item as
workingset refault counter. Any reason you are not using it in this
reference implementation instead of introducing new
workingset_refaults atomic?
