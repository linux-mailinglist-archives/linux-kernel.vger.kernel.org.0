Since the code is not written the obvious way on purpose, the idea is
to document why that is so -- otherwise the reader may wonder (and
possibly re-introduce it back). Specifying when the warning started
appearing tends to be clarifying, too.

The commit message explains the change itself, but the comment
explains why the current code is written like that.

That comment would be great in the function's description, in my
opinion, and it is a great addition to have nevertheless. I re-used
the existing comment for that to keep the change as minimal as
possible (and nevertheless I am not qualified to write it since I have
not studied the tracing code). In other words, I'm not saying there
are no further improvements :-)

Cheers,
Miguel
