It's standard in the sense that PMUs already have their own directory under
sysfs where you can put things. For example, the "caps" directory is a
dumping ground for all sorts of PMU-specific information.

On the other hand, saying "please go figure out which SoC you're on"
certainly isn't standard and is likely to lead to unreliable, spaghetti
code.

Perhaps I'm misreading this, but it sounds like if you knew it was an
MMU-600 then you'd be ok. I also don't understand how a SoC ID makes things
any easier in this regard.

PMU drivers will need to expose more information to userspace so that they
can be identified more precisely, yes. I wouldn't say they would need to be
"reworked".

Well if this is going to be ACPI-only then it's a non-starter.

Yay, firmware :/

Even if this was widely implemented (it's not), I still think that it's
the wrong level of abstraction. Why not do away with ACPI/DT entirely
and predicate everything off the SoC ID?
