I saw pEn and pEhp and pEp:

drivers/staging/rtl8192e/rtllib.h:      snprintf(escaped, sizeof(escaped), "%*pEn", essid_len, essid);
drivers/staging/rtl8192u/ieee80211/ieee80211.h: snprintf(escaped, sizeof(escaped), "%*pEn", essid_len, essid);
drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2sta.c: netdev_info(wlandev->netdev, "Prism2 card SN: %*pEhp\n",
drivers/thunderbolt/xdomain.c:  return sprintf(buf, "%*pEp\n", (int)strlen(svc->key), svc->key);

However, every use was insufficient, AFAICT.

This:
	git grep -2 '\bescape_essid\b'
Shows that all the staging uses end up getting logged as: '%s' so their
escaping is insufficient.

Right -- any they're almost all logged surrounded by ' or " which means
those would need to be escaped as well. The prism2 is leaking newlines
too, as well as the thunderbolt sysfs printing.

So... seems like we should fix this. :P

I think we need to make the default produce "loggable" output.
non-ascii, non-printables, \, ', and " need to be escaped. Maybe " "
too?
