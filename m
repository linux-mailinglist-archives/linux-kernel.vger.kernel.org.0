It feels like "rpmh.c" needs to add "active_val" to its 'struct
cache_req' or truly enforce that "active_val =3D=3D wake_val" all the time
(in other words if someone sets "wake_val" in rpmh_write() /
rpmh_write_async() you should also set "active_val").  Now you can
skip the call to rpmh-rsc if the active doesn't change and the problem
is solved.

Specifically I wouldn't trust all callers of rpmh_write() /
rpmh_write_async() to never send the same data.  If it was just an
speed/power optimization then sure you could trust them, but this is
for correctness.

Right, though the hit is much much more if there is no active TCS.
Said another way: if there is an active TCS than non-OSI mode just
causes a bunch of extra register writes.  ...but if there is no active
TCS then non-OSI mode essentially makes rpmh_write_async() useless.

Hrmm, thinking about this again, though, I'm still not convinced I
understand what prevents the firmware from triggering "sleep mode"
while the sleep/wake TCS is being borrowed for an active-only
transaction.  If we're sitting in rpmh_write() and sleeping in
wait_for_completion_timeout() couldn't the system go idle and trigger
sleep mode?  In OSI-mode (with last man down) you'll always have a
rpmh_flush() called by the last man down so you know you can make sure
you're in a consistent state (one final flush and no more active-only
transactions will happen).  Without last man down you have to assume
it can happen at any time don't you?

...so I guess I'll go back to asserting that zero-active-TCS is
incompatible with non-OSI unless you have some way to prevent the
sleep mode from being triggered while you've borrowed the wake TCS.

As I've looked at this more, I now believe that "tcs_in_use" is not
sufficient for that case.  Specifically nothing prevents another
thread writing the sleep/wake TCS right after it was invalidated but
before the active-only command is programmed into it.  Specifically:

- write sleep/wake
- write active only
-> see zero-active only and invalidate sleep/wake
-> another thread comes in and write sleep/wake
   ...NOTE: "tcs_in_use" isn't updated for sleep/wake
-> thread writing active_only will then program active_only
   atop the sleep/wake requests.

Maybe it's not a huge deal in the "OSI" case because you only ever
write sleep/wake in the last man down and there can be no new active
transactions when you're doing this.  ...but it seems like it'd be a
problem for non-OSI.

This whole "no active TCS" is really quite a mess.  Given how broken
it seems to me it almost feels like we should remove "no active TCS"
from the driver for now and then re-add it in a later patch when we
can really validate everything.  I tried addressing this in my
rpmh-rsc cleanup series and every time I thought I had a good solution
I could find another way to break it.

Do you actually have the "no active TCS" case working on the current
code, or does it only work on some downstream variant of the driver?

transistion
> needed.

I'm not saying we should limit the total number of requests to 1000.
I'm saying that if there are 1000 active clients then that's a
problem.  Right now there are something like 4 clients.  It doesn't
matter how fast those clients are sending, active_clients will only be
at most 4 and that would only be if they were all running their code
at the exact same time.

I want to be able to quickly detect this type of bug:

start_transaction()
ret =3D rpmh_write()
if (ret)
  return ret;
ret =3D rpmh_write()
end_transaction()
return ret;

...in other words: someone has a code path where start_transaction()
is called but never end_transaction().  I'm proposing that if we ever
see the ridiculous value of 1000 active clients the only way it could
happen is if one of the clients started more times than they ended.


I guess maybe by the time there were 1000 it would be too late,
though, because we'd have skipped A LOT of flushes by then?  Maybe
instead we should add something where if RPMH is "ditry" for more than
a certain amount of time we put a warning?
