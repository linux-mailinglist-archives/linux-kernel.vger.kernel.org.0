Yes, to add to Arvind's point the above sequence will only work for
"old style" initrd (block ramdisk with some filesystem image on top),
but will not work for the "new style" initramfs (just a disguised
tmpfs). The sequence will fail on "pivot_root" with EINVAL (see
pivot_root(2)). In fact this patch conceptually tries to have the same
behaviour as with "old style" initrd. As currently, if you use initrd:
1. The kernel will create an empty "dummy" initramfs
2. Create a ramdisk
3. Unpack the FS image into the ramdisk
4. Mount the the disk
5. Do switch_root/move etc

So we have initial mount tree as: rootfs->some_initrd_fs
(and pivot_root works here and you get empty rootfs by default)

With this option we have similar in the end: rootfs->tmpfs
and rootfs is empty, because the kernel never unpacked anything there.
