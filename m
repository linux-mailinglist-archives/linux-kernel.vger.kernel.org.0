Given this would be for v5.5, and python2 is EOL in 2 months[1], I don't
think it's unreasonable to deprecate it. Especially considering there
are already explicit "python3" shebangs in existing code in the sphinx/
directory.

Oh that's a delightful bug. :P I haven't been able to reproduce this
failure (maybe all my LANG junk is accidentally correct)?

Jon, if this fixes it for you, should I respin the patches?
