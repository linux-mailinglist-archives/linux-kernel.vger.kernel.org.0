Exactly. Data-less records are how the ringbuffer identifies that data
has been lost. If users were allowed to store data-less records, that
destinction is no longer possible (unless I created some extra field in
the descriptor). Does it even make sense for printk to store data-less
records explicitly?

The current printk implementation silently ignores empty messages.

Then let me change the statement to describe that data-less records are
used internally by the ringbuffer and cannot be explicitly created by
writers.

Readers will never see them. The reader API implementation skips over
data-less records.
