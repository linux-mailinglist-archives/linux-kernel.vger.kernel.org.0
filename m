Secrecy over a "long period of time" is not what is needed here.  6

And how does that work with email?  We need something that actually
works with a tool that everyone can use for development (i.e. email)

Why are those same people not "targets" today?

And again, it's not long-term.

even get PGP to work as they use foolish email clients.)  Do you?
