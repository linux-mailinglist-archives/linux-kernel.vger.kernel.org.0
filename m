Hi Barret, thanks for the fix but I dropped that patch for other reasons.
Please see below.

With your change the above my x86 system still locks up during boot and adds
minutes to boot time because the many CPUs are sleeping waiting for the
module_wq to be run.

A module is loaded once for each cpu.

CPU 0 loads the module, adds the module to the modules list, and sets the module
state to MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED.

Simultaneously all the other CPUs also load the module and sleep in
add_unformed_module().

If CPU 0 is interrupted/rescheduled for any reason that means the other CPUs are
stuck waiting until the module thread on CPU0 is executed again.  I mentioned
earlier that on some systems systemd is launching greater than the number of CPU
module loads so this occurs quite often on large CPU systems.  This is an odd
bug that also needs to be resolved but I suspect that it is in systemd & not the
kernel.

My follow-up patch changes from wait_event_interruptible() to
wait_event_interruptible_timeout() so the CPUs are no longer sleeping and can
make progress on other tasks, which changes the return values from
wait_event_interruptible().

I believe this also takes your concern into account?

Please correct me if I'm wrong and am not understanding your issue.
