Ah ok I see. The graph binding is for describing the data path, not the
control path. Makes sense.=20

It looks like perhaps you're conflating ports in USB spec with the OF
graph port? I want there to be one node per type-c connector that I can
physically see on the device. Is that not sufficient?

Are there any examples of the type-c connector in DT? I see some
NXP/Freescale boards and one Renesas board so far. Maybe there are other
discussions I can read up on?

I hope that this patch series can document this. Why can't that work by
having multiple OF graph ports for USB2 port, DisplayPort, USB3 port,
etc? The data path goes to the connector and we can attach more
information to each port node to describe what type of endpoint is there
like a DisplayPort capable type-c connector for example.

That sounds like something we should figure out now for DT firmwares
too. For this particular binding, I don't know if we need to do anything
besides figure out how to represent multiple connectors underneath the
EC node. The other properties seem fairly generic and so I'd expect this
series to migrate
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/connector/usb-connector.txt to YAML
and refine the binding with anything necessary, like a 'reg' property to
allow multiple ports to exist underneath the "CC controller".
