Halil, I think I can clarify this.

The "iommu_platform" flag doesn't necessarily have anything to do with
an iommu, although it often will.  Basically it means "access guest
memory via the bus's normal DMA mechanism" rather than "access guest
memory using GPA, because you're the hypervisor and you can do that".

For the case of ccw, both mechanisms end up being the same thing,
since CCW's normal DMA *is* untranslated GPA access.

For this reason, the flag in the spec was renamed to ACCESS_PLATFORM,
but the flag in qemu still has the old name.

AIUI, Michael is saying you could trivially change the name in qemu
(obviously you'd need to alias the old name to the new one for
compatibility).


Actually, the fact that ccw has no translation makes things easier for
you: you don't really have any impediment to turning ACCESS_PLATFORM
on by default, since it doesn't make any real change to how things
work.

The remaining difficulty is that the virtio driver - since it can sit
on multiple buses - won't know this, and will reject the
ACCESS_PLATFORM flag, even though it could just do what it normally
does on ccw and it would work.

For that case, we could consider a hack in qemu where for virtio-ccw
devices *only* we allow the guest to nack the ACCESS_PLATFORM flag and
carry on anyway.  Normally we insist that the guest accept the
ACCESS_PLATFORM flag if offered, because on most platforms they
*don't* amount to the same thing.
