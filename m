I really don't see your point. All it does is limit buffer writers to a
single CPU, and does the same for the atomic/early console output.

But it must very much be a leaf lock -- that is, there must not be any
locking inside it -- and that is fine, if a console cannot do lockless
output, it simply cannot be marked as having an atomic/early console.

You've seen the force_earlyprintk patches I use [*], that stuff works
and is infinitely better than the current printk trainwreck -- and it
uses exactly such serialization -- although I only added it to make the
output actually readable. And _that_ is exactly why I propose adding it,
you need it _anyway_.

So the argument goes like:

 - synchronous output to lockless consoles (early serial) is mandatory
 - such output needs to be CPU serialized, otherwise it becomes
   unreadable garbage.
 - since we need that serialization anyway, might as well lift it up one
   layer an put it around the buffer.

Since a single-cpu buffer writer can be wait free (and relatively
simple), the only possible waiting is on the lockless console (polling
until the UART is ready for it's next byte). There is nothing else. It
will make progress.

It must have cpu prefixes anyway; the multi-writer thing will equally
mix them together. This is a complete non sequitur.

That current printk stuff is just pure and utter crap. Those NMI buffers
are a trainwreck and need to die a horrible death.

I've not looked at it yet, sorry. But per the above argument of needing
the CPU serialization _anyway_, I don't see a compelling reason not to
use it.

It is simple, it works. Let's use it.

If you really fancy a multi-writer buffer, you can always switch to one
later, if you can convince someone it actually brings benefits and not
just head-aches.

So I have something roughly like the below; I'm suggesting you add the
line with + on:

  int early_vprintk(const char *fmt, va_list args)
  {
	char buf[256]; // teh suck!
	int old, n = vscnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), fmt, args);

	old = cpu_lock();
+	printk_buffer_store(buf, n);
	early_console->write(early_console, buf, n);
	cpu_unlock(old);

	return n;
  }

(yes, yes, we can get rid of the on-stack @buf thing with a
reserve+commit API, but who cares :-))
