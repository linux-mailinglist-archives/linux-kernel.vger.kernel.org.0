https://kernelnewbies.org/PatchPhilosophy suggests:

In patch descriptions and in the subject, it is common and preferable to
use present-tense, imperative language. Write as if you are telling git
what to do with your patch.

It provides the following as an example of a good description:

    somedriver: fix sleep while atomic in send_a_packet()

    The send_a_packet() function is called in atomic context but takes a mutex,
    causing a sleeping while atomic warning.  Change the skb_lock to be a spin
    lock instead of a mutex to fix.

So this illustrates the order that Lakshmi suggests, even though I don't
think that order is ever suggested explicitly.  On the other hand it
avoids "This patch...", which would add some clutter, in my opinion.
