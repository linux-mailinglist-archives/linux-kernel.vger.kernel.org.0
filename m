This is just my subjective view but writing code is easier than making
it work in the mainline in 99% of cases. If this patch was doing
something revolutional, lets say a new outstanding scheduling algorithm,
then I would think otherwise. It is not. You without question deserve
both credit and also the blame (if this breaks everything) :-)

So why any of those Linaro folks can't do it? I can add after tested-by
tag parentheses something explaining that context of testing. It is
reasonable given the circumstances.

I can also give an explanation in my next PR along the lines what you
are saying. This would definitely work for me.
