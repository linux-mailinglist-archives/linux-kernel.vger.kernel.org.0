Okay, so SecureBoot is optional with this thing.

kexec_file_load only means something to the first kernel. If you boot something that isn't
linux, does it need to delete this stuff from the DT?
Even if you kexec_file_load linux, it could go on to regular-kexec something that is
not... what should that do with these things?

Other than the chosen node, the DT is treated as a cast-iron description of the platform,
we shouldn't be tinkering with it.

If its not describing hardware, it probably doesn't belong in the DT.


> The logs are non intended to be injected by the boot loader at all.

You're using linux as a bootloader with kexec. We have to treat the stuff that gets passed
between kernels as ABI, as people expect to be able to kexec to a newer kernel.

Is linux-as-a-bootloader special? Or should we work out what any bootloader should do here
first. This avoids having to change this when it turns out someone wants to log UEFI
DXE-drivers/modules in the TPM too.

From the git-log of the ima code it looks like this is some linux-specific format.
Are we certain it will never change, and nothing else ever needs to support it?
(e.g. the DXE driver example above. Is there another way that sort of thing would work?).

Sure, but not needed isn't the same as not supported.
If we support it at all, we need to cover everything that needs supporting. If its ABI (we
treat data passed between kernels as if it is), we need to get it right first time.

(my point? We need to get the ACPI story sorted before we add any support... otherwise we
end up with two incompatible ways of doing this).

Yup: Documentation/arm64/arm-acpi.rst

Arm64's ACPI support depends on UEFI. As a starter:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM64/QEMU

You may need to pass 'acpi=on' on the commandline if your UEFI build supports both DT and
ACPI. The x86 name for UEFI-in-Qemu is OVMF, which helps when googling.


> Kexec_file_load call depends purely on DT implementation.

Heh. And it works with ACPI too! You'll note it only touches things in the chosen node...

An ACPI system boots without a DT. Linux's EFI-stub can make API calls and poke around in
the UEFI structures to find out about the system. When it finishes, the EFI-stub needs to
pass on a set of values to the kernel... we need some kind of key-value store ...

To avoid re-inventing the wheel, the EFI-stub creates an empty DT, and shoves the cmdline,
the initrd etc in there... just like a DT bootloader would have done.

From drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/arm-stub.c::efi_entry()
|	if (!fdt_addr)
|		pr_efi(sys_table, "Generating empty DTB\n");

(you will see this message on an ACPI-only system)

On an ACPI system there won't be anything else in the DT, other than the chosen node.

When booted with UEFI, the memory is described in the UEFI memory-map. An ACPI system
doesn't know to look for memreserve nodes in the DT. (it might work by accident, but I
wouldn't rely on it).

Because arm64 needs to support ACPI too, I think its support for this will always look
different to PowerPCs.

I think the UEFI persistent-memory-reservations thing is a better fit for this [0][1].

As U-boot supports booting the kernel via the UEFI stub, I think this is all we need to
support this. (If your platform supports LPIs, you also need this UEFI table to kexec
safely anyway. See [1])


Removing something that was reserved memory might be tricky, I don't think we do this
anywhere else. Why do you need to remove the reservations?

If SecureBoot isn't relevant, I'm confused as to why kexec_file_load() is.

I thought kexec_file_load() only existed because SecureBoot systems need to validate the
new OS images's signature before loading it, and we can't trust user-space calling Kexec
to do this.

If there is no secure boot, why does this thing only work with kexec_file_load()?
(good news! With the UEFI memreseve table, it should work transparently with regular kexec
too)

Supporting ACPI in the same way is something we need to do from day one. kexec_file_load()
already does this. I'm not sure "only kexec_file_load()" is a justifiable restriction...
