Religion, politics, and mentalities of various countries are not
subject of GNU free operating system and development of software.

Yet all of those subjects can benefit and get use of free software
philosophy and free software.

That is not quite so. In America country it is possible to use pen
names.

> Have to assign copyright (a submissive act).

That is not submissive act but legal act and cooperation. It is
necessary for cases of legal enforcement where evidences have to be
shown in courts of law. Finally, copyrights laws are different from
country to country, it requires a lot of paper work to really be able
to legally defend such cases.

I understand your feelings, but the discussion is not place for
animosity and hatred towards any group of people. Be it American,
"white women" ruling the world, and so on. Please refrain. It is not
nice to call people that way. This is not a political party. You are
free to organize such but please outside of the GNU.

GNU project is not about sharing views on any politics, including
racial, national, religious views, all that does not matter, please
try to avoid that discussion, if possible, publish it on your blog.
