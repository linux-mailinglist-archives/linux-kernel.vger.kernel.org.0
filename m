I'm sorry to say that we don't plan to support legacy SOCs. As you might 
know, we tried to upstream some of drivers last year but found a lot of 
problems to support both legacy SOCs and LGM.

It was a real pain to support all of them with limited resources/time 
and we couldn't make it. Our new plan was to reattempt to upstream LGM 
drivers only. This can be more realistic target for us.

I've discussed internally the amount of efforts to create a reusable 
regmap clock driver which might be reused by other companies too.

It seems it requires significant efforts for implementation/tests. As we 
don't plan to support our old SOCs for now, I'm not sure if we need to 
put such a big efforts.

Stephan,

It seems you don't like both meson/qcom regmap clock implementation.

What is your opinion for our current CGU clock driver implementation?
