Yes. But before sending a patch, I'm trying to dump values using debug printk().

Probably similar idea: "lockdown: Restrict /dev/{mem,kmem,port} when the kernel is locked down"

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/drivers/char/mem.c?h=next-20190822&id=9b9d8dda1ed72e9bd560ab0ca93d322a9440510e

Then, syzbot might want to blacklist writing to /dev/mem .
