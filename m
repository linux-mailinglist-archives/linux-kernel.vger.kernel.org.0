Agreed.  However, it is proving surprisingly hard to come up with a
code sequence that has the effect of rcu_nocb without nohz_full.
And rcu_nocb works just fine.  With nohz_full also in place, I am
decreasing the failure rate, but it still fails, perhaps a few times
per hour of TREE04 rcutorture on an eight-CPU system.  (My 12-CPU
system stubbornly refuses to fail.  Good thing I kept the eight-CPU
system around, I guess.)

When I arrive at some sequence of actions that actually work reliably,
then by all means let's put it somewhere in the NO_HZ_FULL machinery!

There is no preemption because CONFIG_PREEMPT=n for the scenarios still
having trouble.  Yes, there are cond_resched() calls, but they don't do
anything unless the appropriate flags are set, which won't always happen
without the tick, apparently.  Or without -something- that isn't always
happening as it should.

I did try hitting all of the CPUs with resched_cpu().  Ten times on each
CPU with a ten-jiffy wait between each.  This might have decreased the
probability of excessively long CPU-stopper waits by a factor of two or
three, but it did not eliminate the excessively long waits.

What else should I try?

For example, are there any diagnostics I could collect, say from within
the CPU stopper when things are taking too long?  I see CPU-stopper
delays in excess of five -minutes-, so this is anything but subtle.

							Thanx, Paul
