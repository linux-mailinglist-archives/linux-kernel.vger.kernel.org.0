I am willing to take this as a later optimization.

Indeed, no guarantees either way.  The reason for hope assumes a busy
system where each grace period is immediately followed by another
grace period.  On such a system, the current setup allows each CPU to
make use only of every second grace period for its kfree_rcu() work.
The hope would therefore be that this would reduce the memory footprint
substantially with no increase in overhead.

But no way to know without trying it!  ;-)
