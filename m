I'm not so sure - isn't the point of something like OPTIMIZE_INLINING to give
more freedom to the tooling (and by virtue of the option - the user)?

Surely any decent optimising compiler will do the right thing by inlining small
trivial functions that are annotated with inline? And if not, the compiler
should be fixed not the kernel - unless of course it causes an issue - and then
we should fix those specific cases.

There must be dozens of trivial functions that are marked with __inline, I
don't think it would make sense to mark those as __always_inline. For example the
atomics in atomic_lse.h are trivial but only marked inline. We obviously want
them inline, though I don't think we should babysit the compiler to do the
right thing.

(Also the commit message implies that all the hunks are required to fix this
particular issue which they are not).

Thanks,

Andrew Murray
