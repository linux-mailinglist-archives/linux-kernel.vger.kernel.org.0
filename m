Unless I missed somthing, I don't see why you would need to call
devm_clk_get(). This is now handled directly by the framework.

It should work regarless of the order.

The PCie PLL has a good reason to have a single frequency, only one is need=
ed

That's the case the case of the HIFI PLL which, as explained in previous
mails, needs to provide more that the single frenquency you have described.

If the pll driver needs to extended with new ops that's fine. Please
explain this "strict sequence" you are refering too.
What is part of the initial settings, what needs to be done each time ?
