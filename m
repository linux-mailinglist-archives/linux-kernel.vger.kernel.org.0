That's completely wrong. If Intel managed to wreckage the HPET then the
HPET needs to be blacklisted on those platforms and not worked around in
the watchdog code. HPET is exposed by other means as well which means these
interfaces are broken.

If we finally could trust the TSC then we could avoid the watchdog mess
completely, but it's still exposed to possible SMM/BIOS wreckage and the
multi-socket unreliability. Sigh, I'm explaining this for almost two
decades to Intel that the kernel needs a trustable, reliable clocksource,
but all we get are more "features" which make timekeeping a trainwreck.

Thanks,
