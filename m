because rsi is caller saved. The above example is for probing something
like tcp_set_state(struct sock *sk, int state) that everyone used to
kprobe until we got a tracepoint there.
The main bpf prog has only one argument R1 == rdi on x86,
but it's allowed to clobber all caller saved regs.
Just like x86 function that accepts one argument in rdi can clobber rsi and others.
So it's essential to save 'sk' and 'state' for tcp_set_state()
to continue as nothing happened.

>  But I’m wondering whether the bpf jitted code could just directly access the frame instead of indirecting through a register.

That's an excellent question!
We've debated a ton whether to extend main prog from R1 to all R1-R5
like bpf subprograms allow. The problem is a lot of existing infra
assume single R1==ctx. Passing 6th argument is not defined either.
But it's nice to see all arguments of the kernel function.
Also bpf is 64-bit ISA. Even when it's running on 32-bit arch.
Just taking values from registers doesn't work there.
Whereas when args are indirectly passed as a bunch of u64s in the stack
the bpf prog becomes portable across architectures
(not 100% of course, but close).

> Is it entirely specific to the probed function? 

yes. It is specific to the probed function. The verifier makes sure
that only first two arguments are accessed as read-only
via *(u64*)(r1 + 0) and *(u64*)(r1 + 8)
But the program is allowed to use r2-r5 without saving them.
r6-r10 are saved in implicit program prologue.

> In any event, I think you can’t *just* use text_poke.  Something needs to coordinate to ensure that, if you bpf trace an already-kprobed function, the right thing happens.

Right. Not _just_. I'm looking at Peter's patches and as a minimum I need to grab
text_mutex and make sure it's nop being replaced.

> FWIW, if you are going to use a trampoline like this, consider using r11 for the caller frame instead of rsi.

r11 can be used by jited code that doing divide and multiply.
It's possible to refactor that code and free it up.
I prefer to save such micro-optimization for later.
Dealing with interpreter is also a pain to the point I'm considering
to avoid supporting it for these new things.
Folks should be using CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON anyway.
