There is no sync on wrmsr on CPU0 and CPU1. So a better sequence to
describe the problem is changing the order of wrmsr:

1. On CPU1, read umwait_control_cached to eax as 100000 in
umwait_cpu_online()
2. On CPU0, write 100001 to umwait_control_cached in enable_c02_store()
3. On CPU0, wrmsr with 100001 in on_each_cpu() in enabled_c02_store()
4. On CPU1, wrmsr with eax=100000 in umwaint_cpu_online()

So CPU1 and CPU0 have different MSR values. This won't be transient.

So we do need the mutex as in the current patch, right?

Thanks.
