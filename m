That sounds reasonable, but at first glance I think it might be more 
confusing. The API as I reworked it now communicates two different 
(although related) things - the number of blocks that need to be added, 
and the number of bytes within the last block that are part of the file. 
This is able to cover both the corner case of extending within the last 
file block and extending beyond that:

    	partial_final_block = newsize & (sb->s_blocksize - 1);

    	/* File has extent covering the new size (could happen when extending
    	 * inside a block)? */
    	if (etype == -1) {
    		if (partial_final_block)
    			offset++;
    	} else {
    		/* Extending file within the last file block */
    		offset = 0;  /* Don't add any new blocks */
    	}

If it were as simple as passing to udf_do_extend_file() a loff_t 
specifying the number of bytes to add, including both full blocks and a 
final partial block, I would agree with you. But this isn't enough 
information for udf_do_extend_file() to know whether the final partial 
block requires a new block or not.

I will think about it some more. Maybe moving the 'extending within the 
last file block' case out to udf_extend_file() would help.
