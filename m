Thanks, for taking a look at this issue, Czarek. Indeed, it's a

	Dell Inc. XPS 13 9343/0TM99H, BIOS A19 12/24/2018

and IIRC there should be at least one of those already at the Linux sound
team at Intel (you may want to check with Yang Jie and Han Lu; I was in
contact with them relating to a different sound-related issue in 2015).

Well, one has to test things to find bugs ;-) -- and as I sometimes
contribute to the kernel, it is better to keep current on things.

Well, it works on v5.5, so this issue is not really "quite old" (the "no
context buffer need to restore!" message seen there seems harmless).

Thanks again, and best wishes,
