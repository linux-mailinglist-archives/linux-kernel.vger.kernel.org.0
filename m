That is a good question!

On the one hand, you may well be right.

On the other hand, while I see the old code calculating
runnable_sum, I don't really see it _using_ it to drive
scheduling decisions.

It would be easy to define the CPU cfs_rq->runnable_load_sum
as being the sum of task_se_h_weight() of each runnable task
on the CPU (for example), but what would we use it for?

What am I missing?

Yes, we should use add_positive. I'll do that for v3.
