Neil and Jeff, Hi,

But after this, like in flock_lock_inode_wait, we will go another 
flock_lock_inode. And the flock_lock_inode it may return 
-ENOMEM/-ENOENT/-EAGAIN/0.

- 0: If there is a try lock, it means that we have call 
locks_move_blocks, and fl->fl_blocked_requests will be NULL, no need to 
wake up at all. If there is a unlock, no one call wait for me, no need 
to wake up too.

- ENOENT: means we are doing unlock, no one will wait for me, no need to 
wake up.

- ENOMEM: since last time we go through flock_lock_inode someone may 
wait for me, so for this error, we need to wake up them.

- EAGAIN: since we has go through flock_lock_inode before, these may 
never happen because FL_SLEEP will not lose.

So the assumption may be ok and for some error case we need to wake up 
someone may wait for me before(the reason for the patch "cifs: call 
locks_delete_block for all error case in cifs_posix_lock_set"). If I am 
wrong, please point out!
