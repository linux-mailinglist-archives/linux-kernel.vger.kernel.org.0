Correction: Only early GigaDevice nand chips uses this implementation.
Winbond chips uses a dummy byte instead of an address byte so there's
no problem for Winbond chips.

I think this is a spi nand framework issue. GigaDevice uses an unusual
READ ID implementation, and as a result, both host controller and chip
are reading during the first byte after 0x9f command: chip is reading
the address/offset byte and host is expecting the first ID byte.
Here lies two problems:
1. According to the sequence diagram in their datasheet, MISO pin is
in High-Z state during the 0x9f command and the offset byte, and host
could read anything during this time instead of a fixed 0x0 or 0xff
byte, so the check of first byte should be removed. This is what this
patch is doing.
2. If there's a buggy SPI host controller that didn't keep MOSI low
during reading operation, the chip will get 0xff as ID offset, causing
the read vendor/device ID to be swapped. I never met such a controller
so far, but if there is one, it will be a silicon bug that can't be
fixed by software. To fix this one, we'll have to make a second
read-id implementation in spi nand framework.

The second problem only exist in theory, so my preference is to apply
this patch and fix only the first problem for now.
