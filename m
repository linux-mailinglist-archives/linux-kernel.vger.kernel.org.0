Thank you very much for the work.

I haven't ever seen a machine with more than single FDC so that case might be 
hard to test. There are some ISA FDCs with configurable I/O addresses (maybe 
I have one of them somewhere) but they might not work properly together with 
on-board super I/O FDCs.
The most common case - one FDC with at most two drives should be enough for 
the modern simplified driver.
