I was mostly commenting on Sudeep's example, sorry for the confusion.

The case you describe in the changelog (and again here in your reply)
is indeed slightly different, and quite more dramatic (we "corrupt" the
sched_group list).

I believe that could still be detected by the scheduler: the problem is
that we have non-equal yet non-disjoint non-NUMA sched domain spans; AFAIA
the only accepted configurations are either completely equal or completely
disjoint (otherwise we end up "corrupting" the sched group chain as above,
because we violate the assumptions used for building groups, see
topology.c::get_group()).

I'm juggling with other things atm, but let me have a think and see if we
couldn't detect that in the scheduler itself.
