It's backwards compatible.
Let me give a little more detail. The legacy binder interface would
create all devices listed in the module parameter
CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES. These devices were created using 
misc_register(&binder_device->miscdev);
in the host's devtmpfs mount.
If binderfs is enabled these devices are now created in the binderfs
instance instead.
For full backwards compatibility with old Android versions symlinks (or
bind mounts) can be provided in the host's devtmpfs. This is what I
recommended a few months ago.

I would at least try to test both somehow. It's likely that binderfs
will replace legacy binder devices so if we could keep testing it
somehow that would be great.

I'm not completely sure what you mean here. The binder IPC codepaths are
nearly the same. The difference is mostly in how the device information
is cast out before actual binder-ipc operations take place.
In any case, testing both would obviously be preferred but binderfs
strikes me as more worthy of testing.
