I do not think that drivers/acpi/acpi_lpss.c is a good place.

Thinking a bit more about this, my preferred solutions would be:

1. A BIOS update fixing the DSDT, as Andy suggested. Note we can
lso use an overlay DSDT in the initrd, but that will only help users
which take manual steps to add this to their initrd...

2. A new drivers/platform/x86 driver binding to the dmi-ids of the Areo
board, like e.g. drivers/platform/x86/intel_oaktrail.c is doing,
unlike that one you do not need to register a platform_device from
the module_init() function, you can just add the mfd-cell and the
regulator constraints from the module_init() function.

Assuming 1. is not an option (I do not know if Intel still
supports the Aero), then 2 will nicely isolate all the Aero
specific code into a driver which will only auto-load on
the Aero.

Regards,

Hans
