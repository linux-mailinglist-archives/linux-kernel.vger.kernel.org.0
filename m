As the person who originally raised the issue, I feel like I should
rehash the issue:

Right now, using SELinux or probably other LSMs, it's straightforward
to prevent programs from having any executable pages whose contents
doesn't come from an approved (e.g. appropriately labeled) source.
With /dev/sgx/enclave, at least as initially designed, a process that
can open /dev/sgx/enclave can execute whatever bytes they want by
sticking them into an enclave.  I fully expect that people will want
to combine these things: have unprivileged users run only
admin-approved code but *also* allow unprivileged users to run
enclaves.

The latter is very much like the labeled-enclave-file thing we talked about=
.

Indeed, as long as the overall API is actually compatible with these
types of restrictions.
