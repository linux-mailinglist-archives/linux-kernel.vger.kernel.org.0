Subject: [PATCH 09/25] ARM: dts: sun6i: Switch A31s dts(i) to use SPDX identifier
Date:   Wed,  3 Jul 2019 18:15:53 +0530
Message-Id: <20190703124609.21435-10-jagan@amarulasolutions.com>

In-Reply-To: <20190703124609.21435-1-jagan@amarulasolutions.com>
References: <20190703124609.21435-1-jagan@amarulasolutions.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Adopt the SPDX license identifier headers to ease license
compliance management on Allwinner A31s dts(i) files.

While the text specifies "of the GPL or the X11 license"
but the actual license text matches the MIT license as
specified at [0]
