soundwire core ofcourse! IMO All that which goes into soundwire-bus-objs is
considered as soundwire core part and rest are drivers intel, qc, so on!

Again repeating myself, you call an API to do that is absolutely fine,
but we don't do that in drivers or open code these things

1. es2_ap_driver is host controller driver

2. gb_hd_create() is an API provided by greybus core!

es2 driver doesn't open code creation like you are doing in intel driver,
it doesn't call probe on its own, greybus does that

This is very common pattern in linux kernel subsytems, drivers dont do
these things, the respective subsystem core does that... see about es2
driver and implementation of gb_hd_create(). See callers of
platform_register_device() and its implementation.

I don't know how else I can explain this to you, is something wrong in
how I conveyed this info or you... or something else, I dont know!!!
