True, yes we could do that. But there is some warm and comfy feeling
that you really read the revision from the thread local copy of the revision
and it matches what was updated in the other thread sibling rather than
just hardcoding the fixup's. The code looks clean in the sense it looks like
you are attempting to upgrade but the new revision is reflected correctly
and you skip the update.

But if you feel complelled, i'm not opposed to it as long as Boris is 
happy with the changes :-).

Cheers,
Ashok
