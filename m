Yes, unless an LSM wants to examine it to make a decision.

It's not bound to the enclave *file* at all, but it contains a hash
that covers the enclave, so two different files in two different
formats representing exactly the same enclave would get the same hash,
but any change to the enclave would get a different hash.

Wouldn't this make it so that only someone with CAP_MAC_ADMIN could
install an enclave?  I think that this decision should be left up the
administrator, and it should be easy to set up a loose policy where
anyone can load whatever enclave they want.  That's what would happen
in my proposal if there was no LSM loaded or of the LSM policy didn't
restrict what .sigstruct files were acceptable.

Maybe.  The tricky bit is that, even if there was a separate inode for
the writable and the executable parts of the enclave, I think that
both would have to be mapped MAP_SHARED since MAP_ANONYMOUS is
nonsensical for SGX.  This would certainly push more complexity into
the user code.  Jarkko?
