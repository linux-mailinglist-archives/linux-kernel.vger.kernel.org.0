I think Masami's earlier patch proposal to bail out early from 
kprobe_handler() is appropriate here. We don't support kprobe in real 
mode since we don't have a way to ensure that the pre/post handlers work 
properly.

We will obviously also have to blacklist some of the real mode code from 
being probed to begin with. In addition, we will also have to blacklist 
any location where we can't take a trap (MSR_RI being unset, as an 
example)

Christophe,
