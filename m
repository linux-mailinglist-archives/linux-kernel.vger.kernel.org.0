Its platform specific.  In the devices that Rob Clark seems interested
in, there are multiple mechanisms in place - read a gpio, enable the
DSI and send a specific command to the panel controller asking for its
panel id, or read some efuses.

The efuses may not be accessible by Linux.

The DSI solution is problematic because it causes a chicken and egg
situation where linux needs the DT to probe the DSI driver to query
the panel, in order to edit the DT to probe DSI/panel.

In the systems Rob Clark is interested in, the FW already provides a
specific EFI variable with the panel id encoded in it for HLOS to use
(although this is broken on some of the devices), but this is a
specific vendor's solution.

The FW/bootloader has probably already figured out the panel details
and brought up the display for a boot splash, bios menu, etc.  I'm not
sure it makes a lot of sense to define N mechanisms for linux to
figure out the same across every platform/vendor.

Its the specific FW/bootloader defined panel id, that matches the
above defined panel-id property.
