I managed to get that to work, but there are two problems:

- the __diag_ignore() infrastructure was never added for clang, so
  I ended up copying a lot from gcc. There is probably a nicer way
  to do this, but that would require a larger rework
- adding __diag_pop() between two variable declarations is seen as
  a statement that causes a warning with both gcc and clang,
  so I had to turn that warning off as well for all compilers, and at that
  point it gets rather ugly in the macro.
