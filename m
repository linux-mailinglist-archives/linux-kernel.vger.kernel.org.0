Subject: Replacement of Supercomputer @ Home in Singapore Due to Motherboar=
d Malfunction

Good day from Singapore,

Section A: Old Supercomputer Bought on 30 August 2015
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D

I had bought the following computer components on 30 August 2015 (confirmed=
 date), which is slightly more than 4 years ago.

[1] 5th Generation Intel Core i7-5820K 3.3 GHz 15 MB LGA2011(V3) (140W) SGD=
$530

[2] MSI X99A SLI Krait Edition USB3.1 LGA2011-3 DDR4 MAINBOARD SGD$439

[3] Kingston PC4-2133 8 GB DDR4 DIMM (KVR21N15D8/8) SGD$90

[4] ANDYSON AG-SERIES 650W 80PLUS SILVER (5YRS) SGD$95

[5] Coolermaster Hyper 103 CPU Cooler SGD$68

Grand Total: SGD$1,222.00 (on 30 Aug 2015)

Section B: Malfunction of MSI X99A SLI Krait Edition Motherboard on 23 Oct =
2019 Wed
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Symptoms:

When power is supplied, there are LED lights on the motherboard. However, t=
he power supply unit fan, casing fan, CPU fan, and GPU fan keeps spinning u=
p and down repeatedly forever. The RESET LED on the motherboard also turns =
on and off repeatedly forever.

Troubleshooting Steps:

1. Removed all existing DDR4 memory sticks on the motherboard. Insert brand=
 new G.SKILL DDR4 memory stick. Symptoms persist.

2. Use another known working power supply unit. Symptoms persist.

Conclusion:=20

The MSI X99A SLI Krait Edition motherboard, which has been in service with =
me for slightly more than 4 years, is now dead.

Credits: Troubleshooting is performed by a computer shop in 4th story of Si=
m Lim Square in Singapore, because I don't have the necessary spare parts t=
o troubleshoot. Troubleshooting fee is SGD$30. Plus Grab fare from my home =
to Sim Lim Square is SGD$20.

Section C: Buying Brand New AMD Ryzen 3 3200G processor, Gigabyte B450M DS3=
H SOC motherboard and Transcend 2666 MHz 8 GB DDR4 DIMM on 23 Oct 2019 Wed

On 23 Oct 2019 Wednesday, I bought the following *replacement* computer com=
ponents.

[1] Gigabyte B450M DS3H SOC AM4 ATX DDR4 MAINBOARD SGD$113

[2] AMD Ryzen 3 3200G 3.6 GHZ AMD (VEGA 8 GRAPHICS) SGD$138

[3] Transcend 2666 MHZ 8 GB DDR4 DIMM JM2666HLB-8G SGD$58 (bought on 24 Oct=
 2019)

Notes: My previous 1X Kingston DDR4-2133, 2X Crucial DDR4-2133 and 1X Cruci=
al DDR4-2400 memory sticks are not compatible with the new motherboard, acc=
ording to the computer shop. I am reusing the MSI GeForce GTX1650 4 GB GDD5=
 GPU video card and other peripherals in my computer casing.

Grand Total: SGD$309 (on 24 Oct 2019)

Conclusion: Windows 10 Home Edition 64-bit version 1903 is working beautifu=
lly without needing to reinstall the operating system after a complete over=
haul of supercomputer hardware.

Remarks:=20

For the past 13 years after graduation from National University of Singapor=
e (NUS) with a Bachelor's degree (Second Class Lower Honours) in mechanical=
 engineering, I have NEVER had a stable and permanent job because I am a TA=
RGETED INDIVIDUAL (TI). A Targeted Individual is a person who is persecuted=
, targeted, and marked by the [Singapore] Government. Covertly and subtlely=
, the Singapore Government does not allow me to have a stable and permanent=
 job earning high PMET salaries like $8000 or $9000 a month. For the past 1=
3 years after graduation from NUS, I was *frequently* fired/terminated from=
 employment or forced to resign. I am always *struggling* to find part time=
/temporary jobs earning $7-$8 per hour. As a result, I do not have much per=
sonal savings. When another Singaporean flaunted he has $354,000 in his ban=
k account, I only have less than $1000 in my bank account. I can also recal=
l that The Straits Times reported that a Singaporean housewife was cheated =
of some $700,000 some time ago. When my home supercomputer failed, I can on=
ly buy the cheapest AMD Ryzen 3 processor and the cheapest AMD Socket AM4 m=
otherboard. Singaporean Mr. Turritopsis Dohrnii Teo En Ming is the poorest =
university graduate in the world! I SIMPLY LOVE TO FLAUNT MY POVERTY!
