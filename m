You are right. I have not added permission checks for setting the
latency_nice value. For the task_nice, non-root user has no permission to
set the value lower than the current value which is not the case with the
latency_nice.

In order to align with the permission checks like task_nice, I will add the
check similar to task_nice and send out the v4 of the series soon.


Thanks for pointing out.
