I explicitly tried a commit as of the first report (instead of the latest report)

  #syz test: https://github.com/google/kasan.git e96407b497622d03f088bcf17d2c8c5a1ab066c8

and syzbot reproduced this bug using the reproducer. Therefore, it seems that differences
in the kernel config used for "syz test:" was inappropriate but "syz test:" failed to detect
it. Since there might be changes which fixed different bugs (and in order to confirm that
proposed patch cleanly applies to the current kernel without causing other problems), I guess
that people tend to test using the latest commit (instead of a commit as of the first report).

I suggest "syz test:" to retest without proposed patch when proposed patch did not reproduce
the bug. If retesting without proposed patch did not reproduce the bug, we can figure out that
something is wrong (maybe the bug is difficult to reproduce, maybe the bug was already fixed,
maybe kernel config was inappropriate, maybe something else).



Regarding the bug for this report, debug printk() reported that WDM_IN_USE was not cleared
for some reason. While we need to investigate why WDM_IN_USE was not cleared, I guess that
wdm_write() should clear WDM_IN_USE upon error
( https://syzkaller.appspot.com/x/patch.diff?x=17ec7ee9e00000 ) so that we will surely
wake up somebody potentially waiting on WDM_IN_USE.
