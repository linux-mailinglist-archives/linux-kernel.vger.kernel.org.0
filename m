No problem, this is one of those patches that it's best to test a bunch
of loads and machines. I haven't presented it all because the changelog
would be beyond ridiculous.

That is how it works out in most cases. As imbalance_pct can be anything
in theory, I didn't specify what it usually breaks down to. The >> 1 is
to go "half way" similar to how imbalance itself is calculated.

Crap, yes. At the time of writing, I was thinking in terms of running
tasks that were fully active hence the misleading comment.

I wrote it that way to make it clear exactly what has changed, the
thinking behind the checks and to avoid 80-col limits to make review
easier overall. It's a force of habit and I'm happy to reformat it as
you suggest except....

This last line is not exactly equivalent to what I wrote. It would need
to be

	(busiest->sum_nr_running < (busiest->group_weight >> 1) - imbalance_adj) &&

I can test as you suggest to see if it's roughly equivalent in terms of
performance. The intent was to have a cutoff just before we reached 50%
running tasks / busy CPUs.
