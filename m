The only issue seems to be the .reset callback, which doesn't have any
users anway.

Thank you, so these are a good explanation for why the DT bindings
should be different.

I'm not quite sure I understand why the intel driver is using syscon,
then. Either way, it shouldn't make a big difference if regmap is used
anyway.

That is still something you could do, or just drop the .reset callback
because there are no reset consumers using it anyway.

One correct thing to do would be to identify those self-clearing reset
bits and to disallow calling assert/deassert on them.

Since at this point I'm not even sure whether merging the two at all is
better than keeping them separate, I have no opinion on whether merging
intel support into the lantiq driver or the other way around is
preferable.

Ok. If that turns out to be less rather than more boilerplate than two
separate drivers, that should be fine.
