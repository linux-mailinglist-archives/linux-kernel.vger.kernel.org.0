How many different Adreno drivers would benefit from sharing it?

The more I come back to this, the more I'm convinced that io-pgtable 
should focus on the heavy lifting of pagetable management - the code 
that nobody wants to have to write at all, let alone more than once - 
and any subtleties which aren't essential to that should be pushed back 
into whichever callers actually care. Consider that already, literally 
no caller actually uses an unmodified stage 1 TCR value as provided in 
the io_pgtable_cfg.

I feel it would be most productive to elaborate further in the form of 
patches, so let me get right on that and try to bash something out 
before I go home tonight...

Robin.
