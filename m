Ah, right. I had only thought of dcbz here, but you are right that using
an output makes little sense for the others.

readl() is another example where powerpc currently uses "Z" for an
input, which illustrates this even better.

From experimentation, I would guess that llvm handles "m" correctly, but
not "Z". See https://godbolt.org/z/uqfDx_ for another example.

I would still argue that for dcbz specifically, an output makes more
sense than an input, but as you say that does not solve the others.
