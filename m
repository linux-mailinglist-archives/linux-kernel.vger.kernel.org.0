I think you mean the synchronize_rcu_expedited()? Rethink of the code, 
the synchronize_rcu() in ioctl() could be removed, since it was 
serialized with memory accessor.

Btw, for kvm ioctl it still uses synchronize_rcu() in kvm_vcpu_ioctl(), 
(just a little bit more hard to trigger):


     case KVM_RUN: {
...
         if (unlikely(oldpid != task_pid(current))) {
             /* The thread running this VCPU changed. */
             struct pid *newpid;

             r = kvm_arch_vcpu_run_pid_change(vcpu);
             if (r)
                 break;

             newpid = get_task_pid(current, PIDTYPE_PID);
             rcu_assign_pointer(vcpu->pid, newpid);
             if (oldpid)
                 synchronize_rcu();
             put_pid(oldpid);
         }
...
         break;

Yes.

This will be addressed after I remove the synchronize_rcu() from ioctl path.

Thanks
