If kernelci or similar ever mentions this as a problem for them, I'm
happy to change it. I think it's an error to request this test in the
wrong environment (because that implies userspace doesn't know how to
evaluate the results). As I like it _available_ because having it
missing makes the code ugly (lots of ifdefs) and provides to signal to
userspace about it (EINVAL on the write to DIRECT) doesn't tell me if I
have the wrong kernel version or the wrong architecture, etc. Since the
tester needs to be parsing dmesg and system state (did it panic, etc), I
much prefer keeping the signals there.
