Yeah, those thoughts occurred to me as well.  ...but right now there
actually _is_ no SoC-specific compatible string.  From sc7180:

  apps_rsc: rsc@18200000 {
    compatible = "qcom,rpmh-rsc";

I wouldn't be opposed to deprecating those properties and adding an
SoC-specific compatible string, but I probably won't take that up in
my series.  It's already getting a little unwieldy.

One thing that indicates that the first TCS is special and it's not
just that the first TCS happens to be the used for active-only is that
there are actually two active-only TCSs but we check the IRQ registers
in TCS 0 to tell us about both of them.

Thanks!  I was trying to figure out some sort of ASCII art at one
point but I gave up.  I was thinking that the struct was as good was
we were going to get in terms of "visual".  What you've got looks
useful though and I'll paste something like this in.  I'm going to
leave out the "IRQ control" parts though since it (to me) makes it
feel like it's a whole separate memory region.  In fact the IRQ
control registers seem (from the math) to be present in all the TCSs.
I'm going to go with this:

 *  +---------------------------------------------------+

So I'll end up skipping the fake struct definitions and go with the
prose + diagram.  If nothing else it's less controversial than
bogus/unused struct definitions.
