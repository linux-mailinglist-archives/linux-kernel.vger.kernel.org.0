Indeed lockdep would catch it directly as an AA deadlock, but only if
we happen to take the reclaim path under the kmalloc in the notifier
and lucked into it also choosing to lock the same lock we are holding.

The trouble is this is very difficult to hit.

lockdep allows making this less difficult. For instance with a
'might_reclaim()' annotation in the allocator we could check that the
various reclaim related locks are obtainable. Testing doesn't need to
get lucky and go down the very unlikely path.

It turns out this is already happening, it is actually a side effect
of the way fs_reclaim works now.

Okay, I think that is 7e7844226f10 ("lockdep: allow to disable reclaim
lockup detection") Hmm, sadly the lkml link in the commit is broken.

Hum. There are no users of __GFP_NOLOCKDEP today?? Could all the false
positives have been fixed??

Keep in mind that this fs_reclaim was reworked away from the hacky
interrupt context flag to a fairly elegant real lock map.

Based on my read of the commit message, my first reaction would be to
suggest lockdep_set_class() to solve the problem described, ie
different classes for 'inside transaction' and 'outside transaction'
on xfs_refcountbt_init_cursor()

I understood that generally that is the way to handle lockdep false
positives.

Anyhow, if you are willing to consider that lockdep isn't broken, I
have some ideas on how to make this clearer and increase
coverage. Would you be willing to look at patches on this topic? (not
soon, I have to finish my mmu notifier stuff)

Yes, that is where this commit hit it.. Triggering this under an
actual notifier to get a lockdep report is hard.

Hmm. I took a careful look, I only found mlx5 as obviously allocating
memory:

 mlx5_ib_invalidate_range()
  mlx5_ib_update_xlt()
   __get_free_pages(gfp, get_order(size));

However, I think this could be changed to fall back to some small
buffer if allocation fails. The existing scheme looks sketchy

nouveau does:

 nouveau_svmm_invalidate
  nvif_object_mthd
   kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)

But I think it reliably uses a stack buffer here

i915 I think Daniel said he audited.

amd_mn.. The actual invalidate_range_start does not allocate memory,
but it is entangled with so many locks it would need careful analysis
to be sure.

The others look generally OK, which is good, better than I hoped :)
