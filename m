SYNOPSIS: How to create a bootable Live CD/DVD from your LFS build.=0A=
=0A=
DESCRIPTION:=0A=
=0A=
   This hint describes how to create a live CD/DVD from your LFS build.  Th=
e=0A=
resulting live CD/DVD can be used as an LFS/CLFS build host or for whatever=
 =0A=
purpose you desire.  =0A=
=0A=
   Briefly, you will build your LFS system and a "squashed" version =0A=
of it will be created.   A busybox based ramdisk will be created =0A=
which sets up a union mount (either aufs or unionfs) of the squashed =0A=
LFS system with a ram based file system and then the system will be =0A=
started with the union filesystem as root. =0A=
=0A=
   unionfs and aufs are not part of the standard kernel code.   To build=0A=
a live cd/dvd you must patch your kernel to add support for one or the othe=
r.=0A=
This hint will still work without aufs or unionfs support but the result =
=0A=
will not be a live CD/DVD but instead be a bootable CD/DVD (useful but=0A=
with lesser ability than a live cd/dvd). Teo En Ming *did not* patch Linux =
kernel 5.5.7=0A=
to add support for aufs or unionfs filesystems because he did not have the =
knowledge to tweak=0A=
the patches.   =0A=
=0A=
   The original hint was verified with LFS 7.2 x86 (32 and 64 bit).  It may=
=0A=
(likely will) work with other LFS versions also but it only was=0A=
specifically tested with 7.2 and you are on your own to work out how =0A=
to make it work with other LFS versions. Teo En Ming has modifed this guide=
/hint to allow it =0A=
to work with the latest LFS 20200302-systemd development book.=0A=
=0A=
   A description of each step and cut and paste for that=0A=
step is provided.  Cut and pasting should make it easier to build a live cd=
/dvd=0A=
but it is important that you understand what the purpose of each step=0A=
is.  Blindly cutting and pasting from this hint will probably not =0A=
result in success.  =0A=
=0A=
   Following this hint, like doing pretty much anything in LFS, has the =0A=
potential of damaging your system.   Before you begin, make sure =0A=
you've saved a copy of any data that is important to you.  It's also sugges=
ted=0A=
to follow this procedure on a system that is used only by you so that any =
=0A=
errors will not affect others.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
ATTACHMENTS:=0A=
None=0A=
=0A=
PREREQUISITES:=0A=
=0A=
This hint assumes the reader is familiar with Linux From Scratch (LFS).  =
=0A=
=0A=
Much of this hint assumes that the LFS variable is properly set. So, =0A=
when following this hint, at all times make sure LFS is set properly:=0A=
=0A=
export LFS=3D/mnt/lfs   (or as needed for your setup)=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
HINT:=0A=
=0A=
Step 1) Download additional needed packages.=0A=
=0A=
   This step is done on the HOST (not in LFS chroot).=0A=
=0A=
   You will need some additional packages.   Download the squashfs tools,=
=0A=
busybox and syslinux.   The squashfs tools will be needed on the host.   =
=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
#------------ Cut and Paste start=0A=
cd /home/teo-en-ming/Downloads=0A=
wget -4 https://sourceforge.net/projects/squashfs/files/squashfs/squashfs4.=
4/squashfs4.4.tar.gz/download=0A=
wget -4 https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.31.1.tar.bz2=0A=
wget -4 http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/syslinux-4.06.t=
ar.xz=0A=
#------------ Cut and Paste end=0A=
=0A=
   Additionally, the addendum of this hint contains a script that is =0A=
required for the live cd/dvd.   Save the addendum of this hint as:=0A=
=0A=
$LFS/sources/init.sh=0A=
=0A=
   Note: You can skip the aufs/unionfs kernel patch altogether if a =0A=
more simple bootable CD/DVD is adequate for your needs.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Step 2) Add squashfs tools to your host.   (Do this on your HOST)=0A=
=0A=
Teo En Ming's host operating system is Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS Desktop Edition.=
=0A=
=0A=
   If you are running a host distribution which provides prepackaged=0A=
squashfs tools, you may be able to use them.   However they must be=0A=
at least version 4.1 to work properly with this hint.=0A=
=0A=
   It is recommended however, that you build squashfs tools 4.4 from =0A=
the source. This hint was tested with squashfs tools 4.4 and better=0A=
(xz) compression is obtained with 4.4 (compared with 4.1).  To build the=0A=
squashfs tools do:=0A=
=0A=
#------------ Cut and Paste start=0A=
cd /home/teo-en-ming/Downloads=0A=
tar xvfz squashfs4.4.tar.gz=0A=
cd squashfs4.4/squashfs-tools=0A=
Edit Makefile as follows:=0A=
XZ_SUPPORT =3D 1=0A=
COMP_DEFAULT =3D xz=0A=
sudo apt install liblzma-dev=0A=
make=0A=
sudo make install=0A=
mksquashfs -version=0A=
#------------ Cut and Paste end=0A=
=0A=
The version string displayed should be 4.4.   If not, you may need to =0A=
adjust your PATH so that $HOME/bin appears first in it.=0A=
=0A=
If you are on a single user system, or if no other version of =0A=
squashfs tools exists, squashfs tools could be installed in /usr/bin=0A=
or /usr/local/bin rather than $HOME/bin.=0A=
=0A=
If the lzma libraries are not installed, the build of squashfs-tools =0A=
will fail.   To resolve it, either install the lzma libraries or =0A=
rebuild squashfs without xz support.   squashfs (and this hint) can operate=
 =0A=
properly without xz support but without xz support, the resulting =0A=
live CD/DVD iso size will be somewhat larger.=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
Step 3) Build your LFS system and kernel.=0A=
=0A=
   Follow the instructions in the LFS/BLFS book and build your LFS system=
=0A=
as you normally would. =0A=
=0A=
When you configure the kernel, make sure the following are enabled =0A=
as builtins (not as modules):=0A=
=0A=
   SQUASHFS support (and support for SQUASHFS XZ compressed file systems).=
=0A=
   UNIONFS or AUFS support (Teo En Ming *did not* patch Linux Kernel 5.5.7 =
for AUFS or UNIONFS support).=0A=
   CDROM support (ISO9660).=0A=
   DEVTMPFS support.=0A=
=0A=
   Then build and install as normal:=0A=
#------------ Cut and Paste start=0A=
make=0A=
make modules_install=0A=
cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-5.5.7-turritopsis.dohrnii.teo.en.min=
g=0A=
cp .config /boot/config-5.5.7=0A=
#------------ Cut and Paste end=0A=
=0A=
=0A=
   Additionally, /etc/fstab needs some tweaks for a live cd/dvd.   =0A=
Edit /etc/fstab and comment out all hard drive mounts.=0A=
But leave the virtual filesystem mounts (/proc and such) in it:=0A=
#------------ Cut and Paste start=0A=
# Teo En Ming's favorite text editor in Linux is nano.=0A=
nano /etc/fstab=0A=

Step 6) Make a squashed version of your LFS.=0A=
=0A=
   This step should be done on the HOST (not inside chroot).=0A=
=0A=
   Do any needed cleanup and final tweaking of your LFS system prior to =0A=
continuing.  Strip any binaries you want stripped, remove any build cruft, =
=0A=
remove $LFS/tools, etc.   Add any additional data that you would like=0A=
to be present on the live CD/DVD, etc.  A base LFS system (without source) =
turns into only=0A=
a 267 megabyte (or thereabouts) size iso, so there should be plenty of =0A=
space available for extras.=0A=
=0A=
   Exit the chroot and unmount any filesystems that are associated with=0A=
the $LFS directory.   At this point, it is a good idea to do a system =0A=
shutdown and restart to ensure that the LFS directory is unused and=0A=
in a quiescent state.   Make sure LFS is set again after the reboot.=0A=

Step 8) Burn and boot.=0A=
=0A=
Burn the iso using whatever cd/dvd writing tools you prefer.  =0A=
Teo En Ming uses k3b. Reboot the =0A=
system with the CD/DVD inserted and it should boot into your live CD/DVD.=
=0A=
=0A=
Step 9) Usage=0A=
=0A=
The CD/DVD boot menu allows you to boot busybox or the live cd/dvd.   Busyb=
ox=0A=
may be useful if debugging or experimenting is needed.=0A=
=0A=
You can use the live cd/dvd to inject your LFS image onto the target comput=
er (=0A=
rather than rebuilding from scratch..)   First, mount=0A=
/dev/cdrom somewhere.   In the boot subdirectory in the cd image, you will=
=0A=
find the root.sfs file.   root.sfs is your LFS system in a squashed format.=
=0A=
To install it into the target, either use the unsquashfs tools to =0A=
uncompress it onto the target computer system or loop mount the root.sfs =
=0A=
file and then use tar or some other directory copy tool to inject=0A=
it into the target computer.=0A=
