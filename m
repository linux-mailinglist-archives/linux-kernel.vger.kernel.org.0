Mapping the enclave will still go through security_mmap_file(), the extra
security_enclave_load() hook allows the mmap() to use PROT_NONE.

VMA has vm_file, e.g. the .sigstruct file labeled by LSMs.  That being
said, why does the LSM need the VMA?  E.g. why not this?

  int security_enclave_init(struct file *file, struct sgx_sigstruct *sigstruct);

Except that having the sigstruct allows using the sigstruct as the proxy
for the enclave.  I think the last big disconnect is that Andy and I want
to tie everything to an enclave-specific file, i.e. sigstruct, while you
are proposing labeling /dev/sgx/enclave.  If someone wants to cram several
sigstructs into a single file, so be it, but using /dev/sgx/enclave means
users can't do per-enclave permissions, period.

What is your objection to working on the sigstruct?

Actually, I think we do have everything we need from an LSM perspective.
LSMs just need to understand that sgx_enclave_load() with a NULL vma
implies a transition from RW.  For example, SELinux would interpret
sgx_enclave_load(NULL, RX) as requiring FILE__EXECMOD.

As Cedric mentioned earlier, the host process doesn't necessarily know
which pages will end up RW vs RX, i.e. sgx_enclave_load(NULL, RX)
already has to be invoked at runtime, and when that happens, the kernel
can take the opportunity to change the VMAs from MAY_RW to MAY_RX.

For simplicity in the kernel and clarity in userspace, it makes sense to
require an explicit ioctl() to add the to-be-EAUG'd range.  That just
leaves us wanting an ioctl() to set the post-EACCEPT{COPY} permissions.

E.g.:

    ioctl(<prefix>_ADD_REGION, { NULL }) /* NULL == EAUG, MAY_RW */

    mprotect(addr, size, RW);
    ...

    EACCEPTCOPY -> EAUG /* page fault handler */

    ioctl(<prefix>_ACTIVATE_REGION, { addr, size, RX}) /* MAY_RX */

    mprotect(addr, size, RX);

    ... 

And making ACTIVATE_REGION a single-shot per page eliminates the need for
the MAXPERMS concept (see below).

Aha!

Starting with Cedric's assertion that initial permissions can be taken
directly from SECINFO:

  - Initial permissions for *EADD* pages are explicitly handled via
    sgx_enclave_load() with the exact SECINFO permissions.

  - Initial permissions for *EAUG* are unconditionally RW.  EACCEPTCOPY
    requires the target EPC page to be RW, and EACCEPT with RO is useless.

  - Runtime permissions break down as follows:
      R   - N/A, subset of RW (EAUG)
      W   - N/A, subset of RW (EAUG) and x86 paging can't do W
      X   - N/A, subset of RX (x86 paging can't do XO)
      RW  - Handled by EAUG LSM hook (uses RW unconditionally)
      WX  - N/A, subset of RWX (x86 paging can't do WX)
      RX  - Handled by ACTIVATE_REGION
      RWX - Handled by ACTIVATE_REGION

In other words, if we define the SGX -> LSM calls as follows (minus the
file pointer and other params for brevity):

  - <prefix>_ACTIVATE_REGION(vma, perms) -> sgx_enclave_load(NULL, perms)

  - <prefix>_ADD_REGION(vma) -> sgx_enclave_load(vma, SECINFO.perms)

  - <prefix>_ADD_REGION(NULL) -> sgx_enclave_load(NULL, RW)

then SGX and LSMs have all the information and hooks needed.  The catch
is that the LSM semantics of sgx_enclave_load(..., RW) would need to be
different than normal shared memory, e.g. FILE__WRITE should *not* be
required, but that's ok since it's an SGX specific hook.  And if for some
reason an LSM wanted to gate access to EAUG *without* FILE__EXECMOD, it'd
have the necessary information to do so.

The userspace changes are fairly minimal:

  - For SGX1, use PROT_NONE for the initial mmap() and refactor ADD_PAGE
    to ADD_REGION.

  - For SGX2, do an explicit ADD_REGION on the ranges to be EAUG'd, and an
    ACTIVATE_REGION to make a region RX or R (no extra ioctl() required to
    keep RW permissions).

Because ACTIVATE_REGION can only be done once per page, to do *abitrary*
mprotect() transitions, userspace would need to set the added/activated
permissions to be a superset of the transitions, e.g. RW -> RX would
require RWX, but that's a non-issue.

  - For SGX1 it's a nop since it's impossible to change the EPCM
    permissions, i.e. the page would need to be RWX regardless.

  - For SGX2, userspace can suck it up and request RWX to do completely
    arbitrary transitions (working as intended), or the kernel can support
    trimming (removing) pages from an enclave, which would allow userspace
    to do "arbitrary" transitions by first removing the page.
