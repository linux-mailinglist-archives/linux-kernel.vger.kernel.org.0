Correct. This requires collaboration between the caller of the vDSO
and the enclave.

The enclave.

This is incorrect. You are presuming there is not tight integration
between the caller of the vDSO and the enclave. In my case, the
integration is total and complete. We have working code today that
does this.

There are two solutions to this:
1. Write the handler in assembly and don't return to C on AEX.
2. The caller can simply preserve the registers. Nothing stops that.

We have implemented #1.

Nope. See above.

All registers get passed to the handler in this scenario, not the caller.

The approach is as follows: the vDSO is callable by C so long as the
enclave respects the ABI *OR* the handler patches up any enclave
deviation from the ABI.
