I think this is still wrong - if PageWriteback is not set, it will never
clear PG_reclaim bit so effectively the page will stay in PageReadahead
state!

The logic you really want to implement is:

	if (PageReadahead(page)) { <- this is your new PageReadahead
				    implementation
		clear_bit(PG_reclaim, &page->flags);
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;

Now this has the problem that it is not atomic. The only way I see to make
this fully atomic is using cmpxchg(). If we wanted to make this kinda-sorta
OK, the proper condition would look like:

	return !PageWriteback(page) **&&**
			test_and_clear_bit(PG_reclaim, &page->flags);

Which is similar to what you originally had but different because in C '&&'
operator is not commutative due to side-effects committed at sequence points.

BTW: I share Andrew's view that we are piling hacks to fix problems caused
by older hacks. But I don't see any good option how to unalias
PG_readahead and PG_reclaim.
