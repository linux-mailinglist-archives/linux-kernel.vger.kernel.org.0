IIRC, it happens on all the SoCs that have a shared GPIO/pinctrl
driver.

It would be a bug in the pinctrl / GPIO code that would need to be
fixed.

What problem do you have exactly?

As soon as you call gpio_get, the pins will be configured properly.

And, pinctrl shouldn't allow that configuration (gpio_get + a pinctrl
node for GPIOs) in our case. We do on most SoCs (all but the H6) for
historical reasons, but this creates other bugs that we can't really
fix right now. Still, we're slowly removing all of those pinctrl
nodes, so it's not really to add new ones.

Drop the pinctrl group
