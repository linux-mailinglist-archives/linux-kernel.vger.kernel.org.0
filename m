you seem to use the 'swr' prefix in this patch. Most implementers use 
'sdw', and that's the default also used in the MIPI DisCo spec for 
properties. Can we align on the same naming conventions?

These definitions are valid only for specific types of ports, I believe 
here it's a 'reduced' port since offset2 is not required for simpler 
ports and you don't have Hstart/Hstop.

so if you state that all of these properties are required, you are 
explicitly ruling out future implementations of simple ports or will 
have to redefine them later.

Also the definition 'frame offset1/2' is incorrect. the offset is 
defined within each Payload Transport Window - not each frame - and its 
definition depends on the packing mode used, which isn't defined or 
stated here.

And last it looks like you assume a fixed frame shape - likely 50 rows 
by 8 columns, it might be worth adding a note on the max values for 
offset1/2 implied by this frame shape.
