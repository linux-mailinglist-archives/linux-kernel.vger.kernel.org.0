On architectures with aliasing D-cache (whether it's VIVT or aliasing
VIPT), clear_user_highpage() ensures that the correct alias, as seen by
the user, is cleared (see the arm32 v6_clear_user_highpage_aliasing() as
an example). The clear_highpage() call as done by page_alloc.c does not
have the user address information, so it can only clear the kernel
alias.

On arm64 we don't have such issue, so we can optimise this case as per
your patch. We may change this function later with MTE if we allow tags
other than 0 on the first allocation of anonymous pages.
