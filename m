The general kernel rule is that we don't break working applications.
Other than that, we're allowed to change the ABI if existing working
applications don't break.  I can't tell whether you wrote a test that
detects a behavior change or whether you wrote a test that tests
behavior that gdb or other programs actually rely on.

Certainly, with a 32-bit *gdb*, writing a nonzero value to FS or GS
using ptrace should change the base accordingly.  I think the current
patches get this wrong.

With a 64-bit gdb and a 32-bit inferior, in an ideal world, everything
would work just like full 64-bit, since that's how the hardware works.
But we don't necessary live in an ideal world.

With a 64-bit gdb and a 64-bit inferior, the inferior can set FS to
some nonzero value and then set FSBASE to an arbitrary 64-bit number,
and FS will retain its value.  ptrace needs to give gdb some way to
read, save, and restore this state.

I think the ideal behavior is that 64-bit ptrace callers should
control FS and FSBASE independently.  The question is: will that break
things?  If it will, then we'll need to make sure that there is an API
by which a debugger can independently control FS and FSBASE, and we'll
also need to make sure that whatever existing API debuggers use to
change FS and expect FSBASE to magically change as well continue to
have that effect.

I don't really understand your test, but I'm pretty sure I found a
couple bugs in the test:

  88 int
  89 switch_fs_read (unsigned int fs)
  90 {
  91   __asm__ volatile ("mov %0, %%fs" :: "rm"(fs) : "memory");
  92
  93   return read_fs ();
  94 }

This has fundamentally inconsistent behavior on Intel vs AMD CPUs.
Intel CPUs will clear FSBASE when you write 0 to FS.  Older AMD CPUs
do *not* clear FSBASE when you write 0 to FS.  Very very new AMD CPUs
behave more like Intel CPUs, I believe.

  40     struct user_desc ud;
  41     int errcode;
  42
  43     memset (&ud, 0, sizeof (ud));
  44     ud.entry_number = entry;
  45     ud.base_addr = (unsigned long) base;
  46     ud.limit = (unsigned int) size;
  47
  48     /* Some 64-bit systems declare ud.base_addr 'unsigned int' instead of
  49        'unsigned long'.
  50
  51        Combined with address space layout randomization, this might
  52        truncate our base address and result in a crash when we try to read
  53        segment-relative.
  54
  55        Checking the field size would exclude too many systems so we settle
  56        for checking whether we actually truncated the address.  */
  57
  58     if (ud.base_addr != (unsigned long) base)
  59       return 0u;

The base of a segment in a descriptor table is 32 bits, full stop.
This is a hardware limitation and has nothing to do with the kernel.
base_addr is correctly unsigned int in the kernel headers.  If you
actually find a system where base_addr is unsigned long and unsigned
long is 64 bits, then your test will malfunction.
