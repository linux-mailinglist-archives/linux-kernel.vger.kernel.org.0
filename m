This patch restores the behavior that existed from at least
v3.16..v4.18, and the current Redhat 7 kernels.  So you are kind of
championing a moot point as no one has noticed this "bursting"
behavior in over 5 years.  By removing this slice expiration
altogether we restore the behavior and also solve the root issue of
'commit 512ac999d275 ("sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift
condition")'.

Since 512ac999d275, many people are now noticing the slice expiration
and very displeased with the behavior change.
see: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577

I would love to hear if you know of a single complaint during that 5
year time window, where someone noticed this bursting and reported
that it negatively affected their application.

As for the documentation, I thought about documenting the possible
adverse side-effect, but I didn't feel it was worthwhile since no one
had noticed that corner case in the 5 years.  I also could not figure
out a concise way of describing the slight corner case issue without
overly complicating the documentation.  I felt that adding that corner
case would have detracted rather than added to the documentation's
usefulness.  As far as commenting in code, considering most of this
commit removes lines, there's not a really great place for it.  That's
why I did my best to describe the behavior in the documentation.
Smart people can draw conclusions from there as you have done.  Please
keep in mind that this "bursting" is again limited to a single slice
on each per-cpu run-queue.

Thank you,
Dave
