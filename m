Well, you could first set the affinity of kthreadd and only then the affinity
of the others. But I can still imagine some tiny races with fork().

But may I suggest you to do:

-         set_cpus_allowed_ptr(task, cpu_all_mask);
+         set_cpus_allowed_ptr(task, cpu_possible_mask);

as a first step in its own patch in the series. I just want to make sure that change
isn't missed by reviewers or bisections, in case someone catches something we
overlooked.

Also, and that's a larger debate, are you interested in isolating kthreads
only or any kind of kernel unbound work that could be affine outside
a given CPU?

In case of all the unbound work, I may suggest an all-in-one "unbound"
flag that would do:

    HK_FLAG_KTHREAD | HK_FLAG_WQ | HK_FLAG_TIMER | HK_FLAG_RCU | HK_FLAG_MISC
        | HK_FLAG_SCHED

Otherwise we can stick with HK_FLAG_KTHREAD, but I'd be curious about your usecase.

Thanks.
