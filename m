The design limitation is already handled by the fact that the SSP 
operates in 2ch mode, so it's a different case from KBL where indeed the 
DMIC-based back-end can support 4 channels.

I get the error, I am just wondering if the fix is at the right 
location. I'll look into it, give me until tomorrow.
