Sorry, I was not very precise with my language. I will try again...

nl->head_id is read using a relaxed read. A second CPU may have added
new nodes and removed/recycled the node with the ID that the first CPU
read as the head.

As a result, the first CPU's numlist_read() will (correctly) fail. If
numlist_read() failed in the first node() callback within numlist_read()
(i.e. it sees that the node already has a new ID), there is no guarantee
that rereading the head ID will provide a new ID. At some point the
memory system would make the new head ID visible, but there could be
some heavy spinning until that happens.

Here is a litmus test showing the problem (using comments and verbose
variable names):

C numlist_push_loop

{
	int node1 = 1;
	int node2 = 2;
	int *numlist_head = &node1;
}

P0(int **numlist_head)
{
	int *head;
	int id;

	// read head ID
	head = READ_ONCE(*numlist_head);

	// read head node ID
	id = READ_ONCE(*head);

	// re-read head ID when node ID is unexpected
	head = READ_ONCE(*numlist_head);
}

P1(int **numlist_head, int *node1, int *node2)
{
	int *r0;

	// push node2
	r0 = cmpxchg_release(numlist_head, node1, node2);

	// pop node1, reassigning a new ID
	smp_store_release(node1, 3);
}

exists (0:head=node1 /\ 0:id=3)

$ herd7 -conf linux-kernel.cfg numlist_push_loop.litmus 
Test numlist_push_loop Allowed
States 5
0:head=node1; 0:id=1;
0:head=node1; 0:id=3;
0:head=node2; 0:id=1;
0:head=node2; 0:id=2;
0:head=node2; 0:id=3;

The results show that P0 sees the head is node1 but also sees that
node1's ID has changed. (And if node1's ID changed, it means P1 had
previously replaced the head.) If P0 ran in a while-loop, at some point
it _would_ see that node2 is now the head. But that is wasteful spinning
and may possibly have negative influence on the memory system.

It isn't an infinite loop. It is burning some/many CPU cycles.

By changing P0's ID read to:

    id = smp_load_acquire(head);

the results change to:

$ herd7 -conf linux-kernel.cfg numlist_push_loop.litmus 
Test numlist_push_loop Allowed
States 4
0:head=node1; 0:id=1;
0:head=node2; 0:id=1;
0:head=node2; 0:id=2;
0:head=node2; 0:id=3;
No
Witnesses
Positive: 0 Negative: 4
Condition exists (0:head=node1 /\ 0:id=3)
Observation numlist_push_loop Never 0 4
Time numlist_push_loop 0.01
Hash=3eb63ea3bec59f8941f61faddb5499da

Meaning that if a new ID is seen, a new head ID is also visible.

Loading the ID is what the node() callback does, and the ACQUIRE pairs
with the set_release() in assign_desc(). Both in ringbuffer.c.
