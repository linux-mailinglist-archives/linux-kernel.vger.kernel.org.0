Custom hardware doesn't necessarily need a vendor kernel. Most cases
should be happy w/ board specific DTS, possibly some extra drivers,
sometimes perhaps a few extra tuning patches.

But: such development, IMHO, should always happen on recent mainline
and things that aren't really customer specific should be upstreamed
as early as possible.

Vendor kernels are a different thing: usually they pick some older
base versions, do lots of strange things to get their hw somehow
working, and - one of the worst things one could do - merge down things
from mainline into their fork. After a few iterations, the code gets
pretty much unmaintainable. Such things are probably nice for a sales
demo, perhaps emc tests, but certainly not for production.

Just have a look at typical android vendor kernels. Horrible.

Yes, but most hw vendors even never have been active in the first place.

Even if a particular company is doing that in *some* area, it doesn't
necessarily mean they're doing it for your particular product. Just
look at Intel, and what mess the produced for their flopped sofia soc.

IIRC, linux-arm is for arm specific development. Sure, the chance of
finding some consultant there is better there, as arm just has a huge
market share in embedded world.

hmm, if anybody else here is interested in that, let's start with that.
maybe these discussions might be better off-list ?

Well, one of the basic rules, IMHO, would be: if you're going to do some
linux embedded project, you should do a proper evaluation:

* check whether the board is already supported by mainline kernel
  (try to get a running mainline kernel built by yourself)
* never use vendor kernels at all
* check whether your supplier has active kernel hackers and actually
  does mainline integration
* if you run into any problems here, call in a linux embedded and kernel
  export - *soon* in the project

You spend a few extra bucks for the consultant, but he'll protect you
from the wrong choices, eg. buying unsupported / badly supported
hardware.

In recent years, I had many clients that called me in far too late.

One eg. was trying to build a medical device, using custom boards (very
high hw development costs and long timeline, due to qualifactions, etc),
with fancy HMI, but picked imx53, where no *usable* gpu driver exists.
When I brought the bad news, the project already ran for several years
and nobody dared to restart board development. (in the meantime, long
after i've gone, they indeed create a new board w/ mx6).

Such things could easily prevented if people just wouldn't trust the
hw vendor at all and ask us (kernel hackers) early.
