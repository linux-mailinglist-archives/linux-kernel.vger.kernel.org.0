Sure, but in the interests of optimizing for review, it's worth doing a
copy+paste of the key detail into each commit. That way, even if the
reviewer only looks at the patch in isolation they have all the
necessary context, and you don't have to reply to the same question on
each patch.

I see, thanks for the explanation. I had misunderstood the what
backtracking was in this context.

I've given that an Ack as it looked sound to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
