Ok, i will remove marking cache dirty here.

Agree but i would insist not remove locks in your cleanup/documentation 
series which are already there.

These will be again need to be added.

The locks don't cause any issue being there since only last cpu is 
invoking rpmh_flush() at present.

Adding support for other RSCs is in my to do list, and when that is 
being done we can re-evaluate and

remove if not required.

Sure. we can re-look all cases.
