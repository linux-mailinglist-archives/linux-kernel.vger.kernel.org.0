I don't think hikey960 is a good system to use as a reference. SD845 shows more
sensible numbers

How this is affecting locality? The task will always go to the big core, so it
should be local.

And before introducing uclamp the default was going to the maximum frequency
anyway - which is the highest performance point. So what this does is basically
make sure that if we asked for a 1024 capacity, we get that.

Beside the decision is taken by the setup of the system wide uclamp.min. We
can change this to be something smaller but I don't think we can come up with
a better value by default. Admin should tune this to something smaller if the
performance of their little cores is good for their needs.

What this patch says if I want my uclamp.min of my RT task to be 1024, then we
give better guarantees it'll get that 1024 performance it asked for. And the
default of 1024 is consistent with what Linux has always done for RT out of the
box.
