I think that can be done relatively easily.  I've actually been thinking
of multiple pool support for a whіle to replace the bounce buffering
in the block layer for ISA devices (24-bit addressing).

I've also been looking into a dma_alloc_pages interface to help people
just allocate pages that are always dma addressable, but don't need
a coherent allocation.  My last version I shared is here:

http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/misc.git/shortlog/refs/heads/dma_alloc_pages

But it turns out this still doesn't work with SEV as we'll always
bounce.  And I've been kinda lost on figuring out a way how to
allocate unencrypted pages that we we can feed into the normal
dma_map_page & co interfaces due to the magic encryption bit in
the address.  I guess we could have a fallback path in the mapping
path and just unconditionally clear that bit in the dma_to_phys
path.
