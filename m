The place where it does matter (and why I originally did this work) is
when you don't have auto-CTS.  In such a case you really need "N" and
"CTS" to make the math work and both be integral.  This makes sure
that you don't slowly accumulate offsets.  I'm hoping that this point
should be non-controversial so I won't argue it more.

I am an admitted non-expert, but I have a feeling that with Auto-CTS
either the old number or the new numbers would produce pretty much the
same experience.  AKA: anyone using auto-CTS won't notice any change
at all.  I guess the question is: with Auto-CTS should you pick the
"ideal" 6272 or a value that allows CTS to be the closest to integral
as possible.  By reading between the lines of the spec, I decided that
it was slightly more important to allow for an integral CTS.  If
achieving an integral CTS wasn't a goal then the spec wouldn't even
have listed special cases for any of the clock rates.  We would just
be using the ideal N and Auto-CTS and be done with it.  The whole
point of the tables they list is to make CTS integral.

I have old patches introducing this into the HDMI framework?  I don't
remember them / can't find them.  Can you provide a pointer?
