This is definitely not for multiplatform kernels or general distros,
it's for kernels that are built as part of a BSP for a specific board -
hence the "Say N unless you know you need this.".

I didn't know it used to exist. But I do know that something like this
is carried out-of-tree for lots of boards, so I thought I'd try to get
upstream support.

The first two patches, or something like them, would be nice on their
own, as that would minimize the conflicts when forward-porting the
board-specific patch. But such a half-implemented feature that requires
out-of-tree patches to actually do anything useful of course won't fly.

I'm not really a big fan of the third patch, even though it does work
for all the cases I've encountered so far - I'm sure there would be
boards where a much more complicated solution would be needed. Another
method I thought of was to just supply a __weak no-op
decompress_keepalive(), and then have a config option to point at an
extra object file to link into the compressed/vmlinux (similar to the
initramfs_source option that also points to some external resource).

But if the mainline kernel doesn't want anything like this
re-introduced, that's also fine, that just means a bit of job security.
