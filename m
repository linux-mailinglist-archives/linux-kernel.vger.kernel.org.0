I surely agree with Linus that simple architectures could have a more or
less predictable or at least searchable behaviour. If we talk about complex
x86 CPUs, I tend to disagree.

Even the Intel architects cannot explain why the following scenario is not
deterministic at all:

	Single CPU
	No NMIs
	No MCEs
	No DMAs in the background, nothing.
	CPU frequency is identical to TSC frequency

	volatile int foo;

	local_irq_disable();
	start = rdtscp();
	for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
		foo++;
	end = rdtscp();
	local_irq_enable();

Repeat that loop as often as you wish and observe the end - start
delta. You'll see

       min <= delta <= N * min

where N is something >= 2. The actual value of N depends on the micro
architecture, but is not identical on two systems and not even identical on
the same system after boot and 1e6 iterations of the above.

Aside of the fact that N is insane big there is absolutely no pattern in
the delta value even over a large number of runs.

See above and read Nicholas paper. It's simply not that likely on anything
halfways modern.

The variations between systems are going to be larger as any minimal
tolerance in the components have an influence.

But even between two boots on a 'noiseless' embedded system factors like
temperature, PLL lock times, swing in times of voltage regulators and other
tiny details create non-deterministic behaviour. In my former life as a
hardware engineer I had to analyze such issues deeply as they create
serious trouble for some application scenarios, but those systems where
based on very trivial and truly deterministic silicon parts. No commodity
hardware vendor will ever go the extra mile to address these things as the
effort required to get them under control is exponential vs. the effect.

Whether that's enough to create true entropy is a different question, but I
do not agree with the upfront dismissal of a potentially useful entropy
source. 

I'm in no way saying that this should be used as the sole source of
entropy, but I definitely want to explore the inherent non-determinism of
modern OoO machines further.

The results are way too interesting to ignore them and amazingly fast at
least with the algorithm which I used in my initial post which started this
whole discussion.

I let that thing run on a testbox for the last two weeks while I was on
vacation and gathered 32768 random bits via that debugfs hack every 100ms,
i.e. a total of 1.2e7 samples amounting to ~4e11 bits. The analysis is
still running, but so far it holds up.

Thanks,
