Sorry, I'm a bit lost in all those ARM firmware interfaces.

I thought SCPI was supposed to be a separate interface that had
nothing to do with PSCI?

Anyway, my main concern is that I don't really want to make exceptions
to the clock handling for everyone's usecase, and this creates a
precedent (and not even a permanent one, since eventually the plan is
to have all the clock handling happening in the firmware, right?).

There's the protected-clocks property in the DT though that will
achieve the same goal. The code to deal with it is not generic at the
moment, but it could be made that way. Would patching the DT to
protect the clock you care about, when you care about protecting them,
be an option for you?

I didn't know that you could / should do that with PSCI / SCPI.

Like I said, if that's an option, I'd prefer to have protected-clocks
work for everyone / for sunxi.
