"Carrying over the ima log during kexec_file_load" was originally
posted on 5/10 and 5/31 without a cover letter. On 8/29 it was
reposted as an RFC with a cover letter.  The cover letter was v1, but
the patch itself was not.  In the future, please use the "git format-
patch "-subject-prefix" option to add the version number to both the
cover letter and the patches.

The comments you received were based on the 8/29 version.  I haven't
seen anything after that.
