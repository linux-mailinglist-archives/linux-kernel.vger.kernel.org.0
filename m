Is it actually worth doing though?

I'm guessing that device erase can easily take over a minute.

When I looked at 'device erase' on an EEPROM it took just as long
as erasing the sectors one at a time - but without the warm cosy
feeling that progress was being made.

Not only that you can't really interrupt the erase, so either
the application has to sleep uninterruptibly for the duration
or you have to have some kind of 'device busy' response while
it is done asynchronously.
