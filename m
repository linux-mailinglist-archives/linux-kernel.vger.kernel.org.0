I think that may be a good idea to try it out.

Yes, using spin_lock_bh() may be better.

As I am not 100% sure that free_huge_page() is the only lock taking
function that will be called from the interrupt context, I purposely add
this to catch other possible code path when lockdep is enabled in a
debug kernel. It has no side effect when lockdep isn't enabled. In the
future, if other lock taking functions is being accessed from the
interrupt context, we can spot that more easily. I don't see this
preventive debug code as a problem.

This change, however, should be in a separate patch.

You are probably right. Thanks for pointing this out.
