I haven't heard anything from Qualcomm, so leaving it the way it was
in v2 for the v3 I'm prepping.  Someone can always do a follow-up
patch.

Funny that you should pick this example.  There is no 'qcom,apq8064.h'
and it appears that this driver and device tree files use:

  - dt-bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-msm8960.h
  - dt-bindings/reset/qcom,gcc-msm8960.h

I'll point to those.
