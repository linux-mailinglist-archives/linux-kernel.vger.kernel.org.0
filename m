OK, thanks, I wasn't aware of this. I understood it the other way
around, but re-reading the commit message you shared earlier this makes
sense.

I guess it is also worth mentioning that, to the best of my knowledge,
the vast majority of real-world sugov users are in fact frequency
invariant. So perhaps there is still a case for the code factorization
suggested earlier. But in the end it is really just a cleanup to help
maintainability, so if you guys don't buy in there is no point pushing
further :-)

Thanks,
Quentin
