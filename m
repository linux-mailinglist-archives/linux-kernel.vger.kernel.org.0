Yes, I agree, we can't solve the mismatch problem in the general case:
with sequences of hot plug events there will always be a case that
mismatches. I just think we can do better in the simple common default case.

I don't really like that idea. It reduces the confusion caused by
mismatching numbers, but causes the controller to never match the
namespace, which is also confusing but in a different way.

I like the nvme_instance idea. It's not going to be perfect but it has
some nice properties: the subsystem will try to match the controller's
instance whenever possible, but in cases where it doesn't, the instance
number of the subsystem will never be the same as an existing controller.

I'll see if I can work up a quick patch set and see what people think.
