This patch is creating problems on some vexpress platforms - ones that
are using CLKSRC_VERSATILE (drivers/clocksource/timer-versatile.c).
I noticed issues on TC2 and FVPs (fixed virtual platforms) starting with
next-20200318 and still reproducible with next-20200323.

It seems the issue this patch causes on TC2 and FVP is related to the
vexpress-sysreg node being used early for sched_clock_init
(timer_versatile.c: versatile_sched_clock_init). At this point (at
time_init) the node will be marked as OF_POPULATED, which flags that a
device is already created for it, but it is not, in this case.

Later at sysreg_init (vexpress-sysreg.c) a device will fail to be created
for it, as one already exists. This will result in a failure to create a
bridge and a system controller for a bunch of devices (mostly clocks and
regulators).

I think on the FVP it does not cause many issues as clocks are fixed and
regulator settings are probably nops so it boots fine and throws only
some warnings. On TC2 on the other hand it fails to boot and it hangs at
starting the kernel.

In my opinion the idea of the patch is not bad, but I'm not an expert on
this so the most I can offer for now is the basic understanding of the
issue. I've Cc-ed a few folks to potentially suggest alternatives/fixes.

For now, reverting this patch solves the problems on both platforms.
I tested this on next-20200318 which introduced the problem.

Hope it helps,
Ionela.
