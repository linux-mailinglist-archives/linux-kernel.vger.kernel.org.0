If you need MMC rootfs then the DMA needs to be built in or have initrd
with the modules.
The driver expects to have DMA channel and it is going to wait for it to
appear unless the request fails.

Without moving the DMA as built in and removing the deferred probe
handling form the MMC driver, one can just remove the DMA support from
the mmc-bcm2835 as it is not used at all.

I wonder why this is not signaled by automated boot testing, if any
exists for bcm2835.
