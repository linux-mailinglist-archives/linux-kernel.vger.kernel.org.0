I agree that in practice, it's very unlikely this would go wrong.

There are some things the compiler could do, e.g. with re-ordering of
volatile and plain reads of the same variable:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191003161233.GB38140@lakrids.cambridge.arm.com/

... and while I agree that's vanishingly unlikely to happen here, I
couldn't say how to rule that out without ruling out cases that would
actually blow up in practice.

Great! Can I take that as an Acked-by?

I assume this should go via the tip tree.

Thanks,
Mark.
