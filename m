Well, v2 doesn't build. I'll fix it up locally by adding an 'endmenu'
to drivers/soc/aspeed/Kconfig. But... brings up questions how this was
tested before submitting?

scripts/kconfig/conf  --allnoconfig Kconfig
drivers/soc/Kconfig:24: 'menu' in different file than 'menu'
drivers/soc/aspeed/Kconfig:1: location of the 'menu'
drivers/Kconfig:233: 'menu' in different file than 'menu'
drivers/soc/aspeed/Kconfig:1: location of the 'menu'
<none>:34: syntax error

It's ok to submit newer versions, but it's convenient when they get
threaded also in non-gmail mail readers (by using in-reply-to).
