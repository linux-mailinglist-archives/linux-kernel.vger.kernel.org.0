It concerns me too, this *is* an old legacy code. I guess it was left as-is
because no one complained about it.  That's not good, so I'll do some cleanup.

Maybe for historical reason, we have these slightly different interfaces:

- corrupt-pfn
  - purely for debugging purpose
  - paired with unpoison-pfn
  - used by in-kernel tool tools/vm/page-types.c
- hard_offline_page
  - paired with soft_offline_page
  - used by other userspace tools like mcelog

But these don't explain why implemented differently, so I think that both
should be written in the same manner.

Thanks for finding this.
