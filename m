Well, it is there in the schematics.

You might just be getting lucky that it is pulled to the right state.

Good question, but that shouldn't really dictate your binding design.

I imagine that you need some driver to determine the state of the mux.
Perhaps a usb-mux driver which is instantiated by the host controller
driver when it sees a mux-controls property. Sorry, haven't looked at
the driver side of this at all.

I don't see why that would matter. If you need to sense the Vbus
state, then you do need a GPIO typically. But for an enable line, it's
just another level of abstraction.
