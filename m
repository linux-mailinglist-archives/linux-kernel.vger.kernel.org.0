Also, I don't think "tracing_off()" is what is wanted here. That just
disables writing to the ring buffer, which can be called in pretty much
any context (if it's before in_nmi() get's set, the worse thing that
happens is that events will get dropped due to the recursion protection
that checks to make sure there's no re-entrant events at the same level
of context).

The only issue with having function tracing enabled, is that it may add
a breakpoint when it gets turned on or off. And that tracing_off()
doesn't prevent that.

tracepoints still use RCU of some kind, and the protection there has
nothing to do with whether a trace point does recording or not.
