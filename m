Tested-By: Jonathan McDowell <noodles@earth.li>

Tested on a Ryzen 7 2700 (patched on top of 5.4.13):

| k10temp-pci-00c3
| Adapter: PCI adapter
| Vcore:        +0.80 V
| Vsoc:         +0.81 V
| Tdie:         +37.0°C
| Tctl:         +37.0°C
| Icore:        +8.31 A
| Isoc:         +6.86 A

Like the 1300X case I see a discrepancy compared to what the nct6779
driver says Vcore is:

I suspect the nct6779 is not reporting correctly (or needs some
configuration) here, as I see that's what Ken is using with his 1300X as
well.

(ASRock B450M Pro4 motherboard, fwiw.)
