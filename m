Hi Raphael,

Agreed; it's one of those things that I think is *definitely* worth
prototyping, but it's not obviously something we should commit to at this
stage.

Given that we don't currently support userspace access to the counters at
all, I think upstreaming support only for homogeneous systems makes sense
initially as long as (a) we fail gracefully on heterogeneous systems and (b)
we don't close the door to using the rseq-based mechanism in future if we
choose to (i.e. it would be nice if this was an extension to the ABI rather
than a break). That also gives us a chance to assess the wider adoption of
rseq before throwing our weight behind it.

Sound reasonable?

Will
