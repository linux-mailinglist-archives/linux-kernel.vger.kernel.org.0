Might be good to mention that userspace will/should discard the value it
reads, and therefore any value is good (including 0).

Sad though; ideally you'd state that indirect addressing is
out-of-bounds and they get to keep the pieces. But I suspect you're
right that people will do it anyway and complain once it comes apart.
