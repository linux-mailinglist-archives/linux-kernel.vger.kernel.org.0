Well, no, that's not what I meant.
I understand that the kernel currently rejects the combination of 
set_affinity and
sched_setattr.
My question, basically is: Why does it work with exclusive cpu-sets?

As I wrote above, I assume that the difference is that the kernel knows 
which
programs will run on which core beforehand and therefore can check the
rules of admission control, whereas without exclusive cpu_sets it could 
happen
any time that certain (other) deadline applications decide to switch 
cores manually,
causing collisions with a deadline task already running on this core.

You originally wrote that this solution is "currently" required; that's 
why assume that
in theory the admission control check could also be done dynamically 
when
sched_setattr or set_affinity are called (after each other, without 
exclusive cpu sets).

Have I been clear enough now? Basically I want to know why 
cpusets+sched_deadline
works whereas set_affinity+sched_deadline is rejected, although both 
seem to lead
to the same result.

P.
