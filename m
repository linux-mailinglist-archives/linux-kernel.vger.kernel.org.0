I agree.  FWIW, I just learned about /sys/block/sdX/queue/write_cache from 
Nikos Tsironis <ntsironis@arrikto.com>.  Thus, my flag request for a FUA 
bypass isn't necessary anyway, even if you did want an FUA there, because 
FUAs are stripped when a blockdev is set to "write back" (QUEUE_FLAG_WC).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This happens in generic_make_request_checks():

              /*
               * Filter flush bio's early so that make_request based
               * drivers without flush support don't have to worry
               * about them.
               */
              if (op_is_flush(bio->bi_opf) &&
                  !test_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_WC, &q->queue_flags)) {
                      bio->bi_opf &= ~(REQ_PREFLUSH | REQ_FUA);
                      if (!nr_sectors) {
                              status = BLK_STS_OK;
                              goto end_io;
                      }
              }
