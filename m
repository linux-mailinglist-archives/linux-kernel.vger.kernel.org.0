Thanks for bringing this up.

Actually I'm interested how you implement userspace reclaimer. Via a new 
syscall or a variant of existing syscall?

Yes, the solo purpose of background reclaimer is to avoid direct reclaim 
for latency sensitive workloads. Our in-house implementation has high 
watermark and low watermark, both of which is lower than limit or high. 
The background reclaimer would be triggered once available memory is 
reached low watermark, then keep reclaimed until available memory is 
reached high watermark. It is pretty same with how global water mark works.
