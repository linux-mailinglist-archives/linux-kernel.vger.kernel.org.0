I'm familiar with Cuttlefish somewhat. Guess who got virtio-gpu
working on Android[1]. :) I assume DT doesn't work for you because you
need x86 builds, but doesn't QEMU use UEFI in that case which also has
a mechanism for passing entropy.

To clarify my question: Why do we need random seed in bootconfig
rather than just the kernel command line? I'm not understanding why
things changed from your original patch.

We're going to update 13000 bootloaders to understand bootconfig
rather than use the infrastructure already in place (DT and/or command
line)?

bootconfig is an ftrace feature only IMO. If it's more than that, I
imagine there will be some opinions about that. Adding new
bootloader-kernel interfaces is painful and not something to just add
without much review.
