Depends on the deps, and what options are used in /etc/crypttab. If
people hard rely on swap to be enabled for boot to proceed and also
use one-time passwords from /dev/urandom they better provide some form
of hw rng, too. Otherwise the boot will block, yes.

Basically, just add "nofail" to a line in /etc/crypttab, and the entry
will be activated at boot, but we won't delay boot for it. It's going
to be activated as soon as the deps are fulfilled (and thus the pool
initialized), but that may well be 5h after boot, and that's totally
OK as long as nothing else hard depends on it.
