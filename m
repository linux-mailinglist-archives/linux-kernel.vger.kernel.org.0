Even this can break existing parsers. Fixing that up is likely not hard
and existing parsers would be mostly debugging hacks here and there but
I do miss any actual justification except for you considering it more
sensible. I do not remember this would be a common pain point for people
parsing this file. If anything the overal structure of the file makes it
hard to parse and your patches do not really address that. We are likely
too late to make the output much more sensible TBH.

That being said, I haven't looked more closely on your patches because I
do not have spare cycles for that. Your justification for touching the
code which seems to be working relatively well is quite weak IMHO, yet
it adds a non zero risk for breaking existing parsers.
