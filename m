It's clear now, thanks.
I don't immediately see how my isolation fix would make your fix stop
working, will need to check. But I'm busy with other stuffs so it will
take a while.

I suppose you already have a branch that have all the bits there? I
wonder if you can share that branch somewhere so I can start working on
top of it to make sure we are on the same page?

Also, it would be good if you can share the workload, cmdline options,
how many workers need to start etc. to reproduce this issue.

Thanks.
