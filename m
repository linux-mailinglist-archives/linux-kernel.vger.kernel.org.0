All the other reasons would require a fairly egregious kernel bug, hence
the speculation that the #GP is due to a non-canonical address.  Something
like the following would be more precise, though highly unlikely to ever
be exercised, e.g. KVM had a fatal bug related to injecting a non-zero
error code that went unnoticed for years.

	WARN_ONCE(trapnr == X86_TRAP_GP, "General protection fault in user access. %s?\n",
		  (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_X86_64) && !error_code) ? "Non-canonical address" :
		  					       "Segmentation bug");
