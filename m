So concatenating multiple devices without partitions defined in DT? To
support that, then we need to link flash nodes rather than partition
nodes.

No one has multiple flash devices on any h/w already? If I already
have a working system that can load and boot a kernel off an MTD
partition, but could benefit from concatenating other partitions (i.e.
rootfs), why should I have to modify my bootloader(s)?

I meant for N devices, you'd only have at most N-1 concatenated
partitions as there are N-1 device boundaries. Whereas you could
define any partition could be combined with any other number of
partitions regardless of where they lie. The types of things you can
do with LVM and disk partitions is what I'm thinking of.

Similar to how it works with disks. Bootloaders (at a minimum)
understand physical partitions. Later stages understand logical
partitions.

Got any actual h/w that the flash devices are smaller than a
kernel+ramdisk yet had the $ and board space to put multiple devices
down?

What about the stages before u-boot? Assume they all use DT, why
require adding this support before a stage that actually needs it.

I never said u-boot can't gain support for this, it's just requiring
it to from the start even if you only wanted to have a concatenated
partition for your rootfs or non-boot partition. Only the kernel would
need to understand concatenating partitions vs. every component that
reads the partitions.
