Hi Tejun,

Sorry for the late reply.

So is my understanding below correct?

 * currently kernfs ino+gen is different than inode's ino+gen
 * but it'd be better to make them same
 * so move (generic?) inode's ino+gen logic to cgroup
 * and kernfs node use the same logic (and number)
 * so perf sampling code (NMI) just access kernfs node
 * and userspace can use file handle for comparison

Thanks,
Namhyung
