It gives us the option to replace idtentry with something
table-driven.  I don't think I love it, but it's not an awful idea.

I think this will be really extremely slow.  If we can restrict this
to x2apic machines, then maybe it's not so awful.

FWIW, if we just patch up the GS thing, then we are still vulnerable:
the bad guy can arrange for a privileged process to have register
state corresponding to a dangerous syscall and then send an int $0x80
via the APIC.
