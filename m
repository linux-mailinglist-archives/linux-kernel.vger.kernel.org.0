But all of that is availble to you today in userspace, why dig through
random kernel symbols?

Look in /sys/dev/block/ or in /sys/block/ for all of that information.
Is there something that you can only find by the internal symbols that
is not present today in sysfs?

I think the best thing would be to use the userspace api :)
