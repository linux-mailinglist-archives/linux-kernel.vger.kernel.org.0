I'm sorry Ruben, it's just how it has to be.
Your guys tried hard to realize liberation, but failed.

So it has to be done the other way.
I want a young girl bride no matter what, so do the European and other 
Politicians.

The _sunni_ muslims do not bend on this: they're all for it.
Every single other group that was tried has bent.

You guys tried hard though, and almost made it happen, but you were 
beaten back.
Thank you for your service. Even RMS has bent the knee now though.
Oh, and I notice you played Crossfire-RPG (photo on your website); I 
used to be on the dev team there: made tons of maps for them (also did 
pixel art, and did scripting etc later, the latter mostly for my own 
extended fork). Small world.
