Subject: [PATCH 02/17] docs: arm64: booting.rst: get rid of some warnings
Date:   Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:54:11 +0100

Get rid of those warnings:

    Documentation/arm64/booting.rst:253: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
    Documentation/arm64/booting.rst:259: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

By adding an extra blank lines where needed.

While here, use list markups on some places, as otherwise Sphinx
will consider the next lines as continuation of the privious ones.
