What about combining smaller buffers into larger individual allocations; 
any scope for that sort of thing? Certainly if you're consistently 
allocating small things less than PAGE_SIZE then DMA pools would be 
useful to avoid wanton memory wastage in general.

Thanks for those examples, and I'd definitely like to see the 
comparative figures. To dig a bit further, at the point where things 
start failing, where are the cached nodes pointing? IIRC there is still 
a pathological condition where empty space between limit_pfn and 
cached32_node gets 'lost' if nothing in between is freed, so the bigger 
the range of allocation sizes, the worse the effect, e.g.:

(considering an empty domain, pfn 0 *not* reserved, 32-bit limit_pfn)

	alloc 4K, succeeds, cached32_node now at 4G-4K
	alloc 2G, succeeds, cached32_node now at 0
	alloc 4K, fails despite almost 2G contiguous free space within limit_pfn
	(and max32_alloc_size==1 now fast-forwards *any* further allocation 
attempt to failure)

If you're falling foul of this case (I was never sure how realistic a 
problem it would be in practice), there are at least a couple of much 
less invasive tweaks I can think of that would be worth exploring.

OK, that's what I suspected :)

AFAICS arch/arm's __alloc_iova() is also a first-fit algorithm, so if 
you get better behaviour there then it would suggest that this aspect 
isn't really the most important issue. Certainly, the fact that the 
"best fit" logic here also happens to ignore the cached nodes does start 
drawing me back to the point above.

Robin.
