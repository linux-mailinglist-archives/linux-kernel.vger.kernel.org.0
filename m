Hello,

Yes, it can set up the control knobs as directed but it doesn't ship
with any material resource configurations or has conventions set up
around it.

I'm not quite sure what the above sentence is trying to say.

There's a plan to integrate streamlined implementation of oomd into
systemd. There was a thread somewhere but the only thing I can find
now is a phoronix link.

  https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Systemd-Facebook-OOMD

systemd recently implemented DisableControllers so that upper level
slices can have authority over what controllers are enabled below it
and in a similar vein there were discussions over making it
auto-propagate some of the configs down the hierarchy but kernel doing
the right thing and maintaining consistent semantics across
controllers seems to be the right approach.

There was also a discussion with a distro. Nothing concrete yet but I
think we're more likely to see more resource control configs being
deployed by default in the future.

Yeah, exactly, all it needs to do is placing scopes / services
according to resource hierarchy and configure overall policy at higher
level slices, which is exactly what the memory.low semantics change
will allow.

Do you mind elaborating a bit?

Thanks.
