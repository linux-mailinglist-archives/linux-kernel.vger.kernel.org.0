Aren't you going to get in trouble if there are two attached devices
that need to be put into AOA mode?

Although this is technically invalid, it's probably okay...

but this most certainly is not okay.  Buffers passed to
usb_control_msg() (or used with URBs in general) should be allocated
with kmalloc.

Bad programming style (assignment within "if" expression).

Bear in mind that udev->route is supposed to be reliable only if the 
device is running at SuperSpeed.

Why return 0?  You're going to unbind immediately anyway.

As Greg pointed out, there are better ways to do this.

What happens if two devices switch modes concurrently?  You have room 
to store only one topology route.

Besides, what's wrong with binding to devices that weren't switched 
into AOA mode?  Would that just provoke a bunch of unnecessary error 
messages?

Do you really need this test?  What would go wrong if you don't do it?

Subdrivers (the ums_* modules) are supposed to have their own 
individual unusual_devs files.  They don't use the main file.

I'm not convinced that you really need to do this.

The full, reliable routing information (not just the data in
udev->route) is indeed available to userspace.  See the definition of
the USBDEVFS_CONNINFO_EX usbfs ioctl.

IMO the userspace approach would be better, unless you can provide a
really compelling argument for why it won't suffice.
