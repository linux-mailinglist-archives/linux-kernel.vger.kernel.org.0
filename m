since gdsc is modelled as genpd, that seems to (afaict) happen all
outside the scope of what the driver knows about.. (but I may be
overlooking something)

hmm, yeah, I guess the commit msg didn't really make that clear.. at
any rate, I want to see a clean solution pursued in the long run, but
in the short term I also want to get things working (at least if it
doesn't break any other users).  So I don't want to land this patch at
the expense of follow-up for a cleaner solution.. but like I said, I
would like to get s/r working for now.  So I guess I'd like to see
some commitment from the display team to follow-up to improve this in
the next cycle.  And suggestions welcome about how the clk framework
could make this easier.
