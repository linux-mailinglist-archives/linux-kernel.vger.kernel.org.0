Subject: [PATCH] percpu: add __percpu to SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR
Date:   Tue, 15 Oct 2019 11:26:15 +0100
Message-Id: <20191015102615.11430-1-ben.dooks@codethink.co.uk>

The SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR() returns a pointer used by a number
of functions that expect the pointer to be __percpu annotated
(sparse address space 3). Adding __percpu to this makes the
following sparse warnings go away.

Note, this then creates the problem the __percup is marked
as noderef, which may need removing for some of the internal
functions, or to remove other warnings.
