Fixed and I'll post a v4 of my own series with Vincent's included.

This does appear to be an oversight but I'm not familiar enough with
pelt to be sure.

___update_load_avg() is called when sum of the load has changed because
a pelt period has passed and it has lost sight and does not care if an
individual sched entity is runnable or not. The parameter was added by
this patch but I cannot find any useful meaning for it.

Vincent, what was your thinking here? Should the parameter be removed?
