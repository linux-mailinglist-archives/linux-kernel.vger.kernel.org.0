Apparently I'd be wrong.  I instrumented the uart driver so that it
would indicate when it got data from the bam.  Apparently its getting
the data during the 50ms sleep, approximately right after the host
baud rate is set.

Adding a 1 second delay before setting the host baud rate did not
change the observed results - still received the data during the 50ms
sleep after the host baud rate set operation.
Adding a 1 second delay after setting the host baud rate did not
change when the data was received.

Per my notes, the bam would indicate that it processed one byte, which
was a 0, or 6 bytes, all of which were zero.

So, if that were the case, then the number of processed bytes would
probably 1, 2, or 3 which doesn't seem to line up fully with 1 or 6.

Yep, I'm with you here.

So, I kinda wonder if its something else.  The uart driver on msm8998
is not the same as on sdm845.  The msm8998 one behaves strangely in my
opinion.  Any configuration (set the baud, change the flow control,
etc) results in a complete reinit of the entire uart.  I wonder if
there is a glitch, and the driver ends up inadvertently enabling flow
during the host baud rate switch.  If I look at the timing between
50ms delay and no 50ms delay, it looks like the set_RTS(true)
operation occurs at the approximate same time the data would be
received had the 50ms delay been in place.  I wonder if since the uart
driver completely reconfigures everything as a result of the
set_RTS(true) operation, that is causing the data to be dropped -
either in hardware or software.  More investigation would be required
to find data to validate or disprove my guesses about these two
possible issues.

It works roughly 50% of the time, although in one of the runs init
later failed because of a frame reassembly error during the tlv
transfer.
