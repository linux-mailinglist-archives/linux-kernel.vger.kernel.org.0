Yes, I'm talking about link from scsi device to leaf ata_device node.

In libata scsi_device has one to one relation with ata_device.
So making link like /sys/class/block/sda/device/ata_device should be possible easy.
But I haven't found implicit reference from struct ata_device to ata_device in sysfs.

In simplest ahci case whole path looks like:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.2/ata1/link1/dev1.0/ata_device/dev1.0
|______________________|__ata_host__|port|link_|_tdev_|___ata_device___|


/sys/class/ata_device/dev1.0 points directly to leaf ata_device
While in struct ata_device tdev is different intermediate node.

It would be nice merge tdev and ata_device into one node, or at least embed leaf
struct device into struct ata_device too.

As I see ata registers only "transport" device while scsi transport template
magically matches it and creates actual ata device of ata_dev_class.
I see no reason for this complexity. Why ata host couldn't enumerate and
register all these devices explicitly?
