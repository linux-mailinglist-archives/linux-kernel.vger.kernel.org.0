There is a giant difference between 'needs to be higher than OTHER' and
FIFO-99.

So what; at that point that's exactly what you're asking for. Using RT
is for those who know what they're doing.

Furthermore, actual RT programs will have pre-allocated and locked any
memory they rely on. They don't give a crap about your pressure
nonsense.

By marking it FIFO-99 you're in effect saying that your stupid
statistics gathering is more important than your life. It will preempt
the task that's in control of the band-saw emergency break, it will
preempt the task that's adjusting the electromagnetic field containing
this plasma flow.

That's insane.

I'm going to queue a patch to reduce this to FIFO-1, that will preempt
regular OTHER tasks but will not perturb (much) actual RT bits.
