This would break the today usage model of uptr and it will
break userspace expectation ie if GPU is writting to that
memory and that memory then the userspace want to make sure
that it will see what the GPU write.

Yes i915 is broken in respect to not having a end notifier
and tracking active invalidation for a range but the GUP
side of thing kind of hide this bug and it shrinks the window
for bad to happen to something so small that i doubt anyone
could ever hit it (still a bug thought).

Cheers,
Jérôme
