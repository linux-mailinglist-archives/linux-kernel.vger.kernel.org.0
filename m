My initial approach to pidfd polling did it this way, and I remember there
was a break in semantics where this does not work well. We want the
notification to happen in do_notify_parent() so that it is in sync with the
wait APIs..

I don't see a risk with this patch though. But let us see what Oleg's eyes
find.

The barriers were initially add by me to your patch, but then I felt it may
not be needed so I removed them before sending the patch. My initial concern
was something like the following:

CPU 0                      CPU 1
------------------------------------------------
store tsk->exit_state = 1
/* smp_wmb() ? */
do_notify_parent
wake up
                           poll_wait()
                           /* smp_rmb(); ? */
                           read tsk->exit_state = 0
                           block...


I was initially concerned if tsk->exit_state write would be missed by the
polling thread and we would block forever (similar to this bug).

I don't think this is possible anymore since wakeup implies release-barrier
and waiting implies acquire barrier AFAIU. I am still not fully sure though,
so yeah if you guys think it is an issue, let us add the memory barriers. As
such I know memory barrier additions to the kernel requires justification,
otherwise Linus calls it "Voodoo programming". So let us convince ourself
first if memory barriers are needed before adding them anyway.

thanks,
