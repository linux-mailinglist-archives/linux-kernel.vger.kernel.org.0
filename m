Ok, and how do you handle this same thing for something like /dev/sda ?
(hint, it isn't new, and is something we solved over a decade ago)

If you worry about stuff like this, use a persistant device naming
scheme and have your device node be pointed to by a symlink.  Create
that symlink by using the information in the initial 'ADD' uevent.

That way, when userspace opens the device node, it "knows" exactly which
one it opens.  It sounds like you have a bunch of metadata to describe
these uniquely, so pass that in the ADD event, not in some other crazy
non-standard manner.
