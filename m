I am okay with this. I know, what you are talking about, since I know
the code very well. But maybe it is a bit harder to follow for others.

That panel.c doesn't compile is of course a no-go. Sorry. I missed
something and I will fix this in a next version of the patch. But before
submitting a next version, I will wait some time, if there is more
feedback.
The idea with changing the return types: It seems a bit, that with this
patch charlcd is becoming more of an universal interface and maybe more
display backends get added - maybe with displays, that can report
failure of operations. And I thought, it will be better to have this
earlier and have the "interface" stable and more uniform. But you are
the maintainer. If you don't like the changed return types I happily
revert back to the original ones in the next version of the patch.

This is not intended. I'll change it.

I can split this out into separate patches. It'd be good know what else
you mean by "some things" so I can do this as well. Do you want each
enum as a separate patch or one big enum patch ?

>   * From checkpatch.pl: DOS line endings and trailing whitespace

Strange. I did indeed checkpatch.pl the patches before submitting and I
got no complaints about whitespace or line endings. There was "WARNING:
added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?" and
patch 1 also has "WARNING: please write a paragraph that describes the
config symbol fully". I submitted the patches with git send-email so it
is very unlikely, that the mailer messed up the patches. Strange...
Oh by the way: Do you know what I can do to make checkpatch happy with
its describing of the config symbol ? I tried writing a help paragraph
for the config symbols in Kconfig, but that did not help.

Are you able to test the panel driver ?

Thank you for your prompt feedback!
