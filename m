Kees,

Could this be related to your selftest Makefile test run output
refactoring work?

I did a quick test on 5.2 after my first kselftest update without
the refactor work - firmware test worked.

I am thinking this is related to

eff3ee303d0d
selftests: Extract single-test shell logic from lib.mk

bash vs. sh difference in "echo" command behavior is the cause
is my best guess. Will you be able to take a look at this?

sudo make -C tools/testing/selftests/firmware/ run_tests

will show the difference.

thanks,
-- Shuah
