So I'd figure that an API like this would be required:

and in platform.c, adding:

int platform_get_irqs_affinity(struct platform_device *dev, struct 
irq_affinity *affd, unsigned int *count, int **irqs)
{
	int i;
	int *pirqs;

	if (ACPI_COMPANION(&dev->dev)) {
		*count = acpi_irq_get_count(ACPI_HANDLE(&dev->dev));
	} else {
		// TODO
	}

	pirqs = kzalloc(*count * sizeof(int), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!pirqs)
		return -ENOMEM;

	dev->desc = irq_create_affinity_masks(*count, affd);
	if (!dev->desc) {
		kfree(irqs);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}

	for (i = 0; i < *count; i++) {
		pirqs[i] = platform_get_irq(dev, i);
		if (irqs[i] < 0) {
			kfree(dev->desc);
			kfree(irqs);
			return -ENOMEM;
		}
	}

	*irqs = pirqs;

	return 0;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(platform_get_irqs_affinity);

Here we pass the affinity descriptor and allocate all IRQs for a device.

So this is less than a half-baked solution. We only create the affinity 
masks but do nothing with them, and the actual irq_desc 's generated 
would not would have their affinity mask set and would not be managed. 
Only the platform device driver itself would access the masks, to set 
the irq affinity hint, etc.

To achieve the proper result, we would somehow need to pass the per-IRQ 
affinity descriptor all the way down through 
platform_get_irq()->acpi_irq_get()->irq_create_fwspec_mapping()->irq_domain_alloc_irqs(), 
which could involve disruptive changes in different subsystems - not 
welcome, I'd say.

I could take the alt approach to generate the interrupt affinity masks 
in my LLDD instead. Considering I know some of the CPU and numa node 
properties of the device host, I could generate the masks in the LLDD 
itself simply, but I still would rather avoid this if possible and use 
standard APIs.

So if there are any better ideas on this, then it would be good to hear 
them.

Thanks,
john
