Yes. The reserved fields can be used for anything that boot loaders and 
Linux kernel can agree with each other. If you look at the ARM64, they 
have "Informative flags" in place of res1.

Technically, we are just implementing the "DOS" header part of PE/COFF 
format for now. It only mandates a magic string "MZ" at the top and a 
32bit value at offset 0x3c tells us offset of PE/COFF header in image.
Anything in between is implementation specific.

For example, it will be updated to support EFI stub as described in the 
commit text,
"In order to support EFI stub, code0 should be replaced with "MZ" magic 
string and res5(at offset 0x3c) should point to the rest of the PE/COFF 
header (which will be added during EFI support)."
