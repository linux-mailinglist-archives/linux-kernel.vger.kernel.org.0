Currently releasing jffs2_sb_info in jffs2_kill_sb(),
Then the current code path is
1. drivers/mtd/mtdsuper.c
mount_mtd_aux() {
....
   /* jffs2_sb_info is allocated in jffs2_fill_super, */
    ret = fill_super(sb, data, flags & SB_SILENT ? 1 : 0);
    if (ret < 0) {
        deactivate_locked_super(sb); /* If the parameter is wrong, release it here*/
        return ERR_PTR(ret);
    }
...
}

2. fs/super.c
deactivate_locked_super()
---> fs->kill_sb(s);

3. fs/jffs2/super.c
 jffs2_kill_sb()
    kfree(c); /*release jffs2_sb_info allocated by jffs2_fill_super here

Here memory allocation and release,
experienced the function of mount_mtd_aux/deactivate_locked_super/jffs2_kill_sb three different files,
the path is relatively long,
if any of the three functions between the errors,
it will cause problems (such as memory leaks)

Analyze the code of jffs2_kill_sb:
static void jffs2_kill_sb(struct super_block *sb)
{
    struct jffs2_sb_info *c = JFFS2_SB_INFO(sb);
    if (c && !sb_rdonly(sb))
		/* If sb is not read only,
		 * then jffs2_stop_garbage_collect_thread() will be executed
		 * when the jffs2_fill_super parameter is invalid.
		 */
        jffs2_stop_garbage_collect_thread(c);
    kill_mtd_super(sb);
    kfree(c);
}

void jffs2_stop_garbage_collect_thread(struct jffs2_sb_info *c)
{
    int wait = 0;
	/* When the jffs2_fill_super parameter is invalid,
	 * this lock is not initialized.
	 * Is this a code problem ?
	 */
    spin_lock(&c->erase_completion_lock);
.....

I still think this is easier to understand:
 Free the memory allocated by the current function in the failed branch

thanks
