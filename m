Yeah, very interesting. Finally I got their original purpose from
Documentation/x86/boot.rst.


Special Command Line Options
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D

If the command line provided by the boot loader is entered by the
user, the user may expect the following command line options to work.
They should normally not be deleted from the kernel command line even
though not all of them are actually meaningful to the kernel.  Boot
loader authors who need additional command line options for the boot
loader itself should get them registered in
Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.rst to make sure they will not
conflict with actual kernel options now or in the future.

...

So here, [KNL,BOOT], KNL means it's used for kernel, BOOT means it's
needed by boot loader.

I think we should at least add a note in kernel-parameters.txt to
explain this. Will add it.

Thanks
Baoquan
