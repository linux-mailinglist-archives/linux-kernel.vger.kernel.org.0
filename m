I will add a documentation section about why a linked list was used.

The cmpxchg() issue you mention is why I needed descriptors. But even if
I were to implement a fixed-record-size ringbuffer where the cmpxchg()
issue does not exist, I _still_ would have used a linked list to connect
the records.

It is misleading to think the linked list is because of variable size
records.
