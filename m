Well, it's not officially the preferred style. There's 240 uses of
(void *) in memset, compared to 98 uses of (char *)

$ git grep memset | grep '(void \*)' | wc -l
240

$ git grep memset | grep '(char \*)' | wc -l
98

I was about to make the conversion, but when I added addition to the
equation, the (char *) went ahead slightly:

$ git grep memset | grep '(void \*)' | grep '+' | wc -l
32

$ git grep memset | grep '(char \*)' | grep '+' | wc -l
35

Both are fine and legit, but as the weight is slightly higher doing
byte arithmetic with char *, I'll keep it as is.
