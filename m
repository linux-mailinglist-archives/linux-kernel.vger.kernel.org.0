Right. Commit message seemed descriptive to me, but i should probably
try to improve the explanation in the commit message.

With DPDK and CPU isolation, there are no low resolution timers running on
the isolated CPUs. So prevent raising timer softirq if no pending timer 
is available is enough.

Since it was based on the idea of 

https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/446045/

Which was an -RT patch, i decided to submit it against the -RT kernel.

But it can be merged through the mainline kernel queue as well, 
i believe.

x86 hardware, with KVM virtualized, running -RT kernel on both host
and guest. Relevant host kernel command line:

isolcpus=1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,14
intel_pstate=disable nosoftlockup nohz=on
nohz_full=1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,14
rcu_nocbs=1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,14

Relevant guest kernel command line:
isolcpus=1 nosoftlockup nohz=on nohz_full=1
rcu_nocbs=1

And workload in question is cyclictest (the production
software is DPDK, but cyclictest is used to gather 
latency data).

> Did you also run other tests?

Yes, have a custom module stress test to attempt to hit the race.
Daniel (CC'ed) ran it under a kernel with debugging enabled, 
with no apparent problems.

So one downside of this patch is that raises the softirq 
unnecessarily sometimes. However, its impact is reduced to
isolated CPUs.
