Hm... not sure the firmware will fix this issue, as it falls back to
the default ctefx.bin firmware which should work fine. But it's worth
a shot.

His card looks like it's being identified properly, and I've had
reports from others with the same motherboard codecs not having
issues.

There's not too much that I can really troubleshoot with these cards,
as I lack the documentation. All that I know is from capturing the HDA
verbs from a Windows virtual machine with PCI passthrough.

The only thing I can really think of is GPIO potentially, but that
would be re-set when the Linux driver is booted up. I know some users
have to do a full on shutdown to clear the cards internal memory for
it to work in Linux, but it sounds like he may have already done that.

I'll look into this a little bit when I get some time, but the issue
is that I don't have too many options/ideas on what could be
potentially wrong.
