I don't know.

It's a shame that someone (anyone) is still using it.

Does the hardware work as (optionally; programmable) level triggered or edge triggered?
Usually not in my experience.
Usually one or the other.

No, in 2.6.21 it is named 'set_irq_type'.

I can't see that it was experimental.

No.

It is named irq_set_irq_type in 2.6.39.  That's the earliest AFAICT.

'grep' is really easy to use.

Good luck.
