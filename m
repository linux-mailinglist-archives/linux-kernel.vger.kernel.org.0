Ok. That implies, we need a check to make sure SVE set up is complete,
which we don't at the moment, as we default to assume FP/SIMD is available.

"system_can_use_fpsimd()" instead of the "system_supports_fpsimd() where
the former should indicate:

  system_supports_fpsimd() && sve_setup_complete()

Where the sve_setup_complete() can itself be a static key, initialized
very early if we have !CONFIG_SVE. Otherwise, set from sve_setup().


Thoughts ?
