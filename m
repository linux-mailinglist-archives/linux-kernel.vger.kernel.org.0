Ah!

Ugh.

Ok, if the soc "core" wants devices to put sysfs files under the "socX"
device, then it needs to provide for a way to do this in a sane manner.
Exposing the "struct device" of the device here is NOT the sane way to
do this.

So we are back to the original request I made here, the SOC "core" needs
to be able to create these files for you, so an attribute group list
must be available for the soc "driver" to set.

What it is doing now is not ok.

"pass"?  You mean "create", right?

I don't understand what you mean by this second option, sorry.

See my suggestion above, what we have now is just not ok.
