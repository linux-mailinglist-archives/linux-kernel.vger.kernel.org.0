Without the "deferred key processing" changes, only keys added at 
runtime were measured (if policy permitted).

"deferred key processing" enabled queuing keys added early in the boot 
process and measured them when the policy is loaded.

We can make this (the queuing) optional through a config, but leave the 
runtime key measurement auto-enabled (as is the config 
IMA_MEASURE_ASYMMETRIC_KEYS now).
