Hi Linus,

this goes back to the discussion at last years kernel summit, where
we had the discussion on removing code never used by any in-kernel
user an no prospects of one.  The IBM folks are unfortunately still
dragging their feet on the powerpc side.  Can we revise this discussion?

The use case here is a IBM specific bus for which they only have an
out of tree driver that their partner doesn't want to submit for mainline,
but keep insisting on keeping the code around (which is also built
uncondіtionally for the platform).

I hope we had settled that argument back then, but it seems like Big
Blue insists they are special.
