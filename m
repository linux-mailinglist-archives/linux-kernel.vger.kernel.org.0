Well, all this started with COARSE clocks not being supported by PPC32 
VDSO. I first submitted a series with a set of optimisations including 
the implementation of COARSE clocks 
(https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=126779)

Then after a comment received on patch 4 of the series from Santosh 
Sivaraj asking for a common implementation of it for PPC32 and PPC64, I 
started looking into making the whole VDSO source code common to PPC32 
and PPC64. Most functions are similar. Time functions are also rather 
similar but unfortunately don't use the same registers. They also don't 
cover all possible clocks. And getres() is also buggy, see series 
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=110321

So instead of reworking the existing time functions, I started 
investigating whether we could plug powerpc to the generic 
implementation. One drawback of PPC is that we need to setup an ASM 
trampoline to handle the SO bit as it can't be handled from C directly, 
can it ?

How critical are these functions ? Although we have a slight degration 
with the C implementation, they are still way faster than the 
corresponding syscall.

Another thing I was wondering, is it worth using the 64 bit timebase on 
PPC32 ? As far as I understand, the timebase is there to calculate a 
linear date update since last VDSO datapage update. How often is the 
VDSO datapage updated ? On the 885 clocked at 132Mhz, the timebase is at 
8.25 Mhz, which means it needs more than 8 minutes to loop over 32 bits.
