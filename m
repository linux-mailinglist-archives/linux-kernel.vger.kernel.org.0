Just to confirm, the annotation is supposed to mean "this variable
should not be accessed concurrently". '__lockfree' may be confusing,
as "lock-free" has a very specific meaning ("lock-free algorithm"),
and I initially thought the annotation means the opposite. Maybe more
intuitive would be '__nonatomic'.

My view, however, is that this will not scale. 1) Our goal is to
*avoid* more annotations if possible. 2) Furthermore, any such
annotation assumes the developer already has understanding of all
concurrently accessed variables; however, this may not be the case for
the next person touching the code, resulting in an error. By
"whitelisting" variables, we would likely miss almost every serious
bug.

To enable/disable KCSAN for entire subsystems, it's already possible
to use 'KCSAN_SANITIZE :=n' in the Makefile, or 'KCSAN_SANITIZE_file.o
:= n' for individual files.

The sheer volume of 'benign' data-races makes it difficult to filter
through and get to these, but it certainly detects such issues.
