I know this series might have side effects despite the consequent
amount of time spent to write and test it, but I also think the
clk subsystem would really benefit from such change and handling
suspend to RAM support would be greatly enhanced. You seemed
interested at first and now not anymore, could I know why? I got
inspired by the regulators subsystem. It is not an idea of mine
that device links should be bring to clocks. Regulators are almost
as used as clocks so I really understand your fears but why not
applying this to -next very early during the -rc cycles and see
what happens? You'll have plenty of time to ask me to fix things
or even drop it off.

Kind regards,
Miquèl
