-=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
-
-Brutus is an evaluation platform for the SA1100 manufactured by Intel.
-For more details, see:
-
-http://developer.intel.com
-
-To compile for Brutus, you must issue the following commands::
-
-	make brutus_config
-	make config
-	[accept all the defaults]
-	make zImage
-
-The resulting kernel will end up in linux/arch/arm/boot/zImage.  This fil=
e
-must be loaded at 0xc0008000 in Brutus's memory and execution started at
-0xc0008000 as well with the value of registers r0 =3D 0 and r1 =3D 16 upo=
n
-entry.
-
-But prior to execute the kernel, a ramdisk image must also be loaded in
-memory.  Use memory address 0xd8000000 for this.  Note that the file
-containing the (compressed) ramdisk image must not exceed 4 MB.
-
-Typically, you'll need angelboot to load the kernel.
-The following angelboot.opt file should be used::
-
-	base 0xc0008000
-	entry 0xc0008000
-	r0 0x00000000
-	r1 0x00000010
-	device /dev/ttyS0
-	options "9600 8N1"
-	baud 115200
-	otherfile ramdisk_img.gz
-	otherbase 0xd8000000
-
-Then load the kernel and ramdisk with::
-
-	angelboot -f angelboot.opt zImage
-
-The first Brutus serial port (assumed to be linked to /dev/ttyS0 on your
-host PC) is used by angel to load the kernel and ramdisk image. The seria=
l
-console is provided through the second Brutus serial port. To access it,
-you may use minicom configured with /dev/ttyS1, 9600 baud, 8N1, no flow
-control.
-
-Currently supported

-
-	- RS232 serial ports
-	- audio output
-	- LCD screen
-	- keyboard
-
-The actual Brutus support may not be complete without extra patches.
-If such patches exist, they should be found from
-ftp.netwinder.org/users/n/nico.
-
-A full PCMCIA support is still missing, although it's possible to hack
-some drivers in order to drive already inserted cards at boot time with
-little modifications.
-
-Any contribution is welcome.
-
-Please send patches to nico@fluxnic.net

-The original Linux support for this product has been provided by
-Nicolas Pitre <nico@fluxnic.net>. Continued development work by
-Woojung Huh <whuh@applieddata.net>
-
-It's currently possible to mount a root filesystem via NFS providing a
-complete Linux environment.  Otherwise a ramdisk image may be used.  The
-board supports MTD/JFFS, so you could also mount something on there.
-
-Use 'make graphicsclient_config' before any 'make config'.  This will set=
 up
-defaults for GraphicsClient Plus support.
-
-The kernel zImage is linked to be loaded and executed at 0xc0200000.
-Also the following registers should have the specified values upon entry:=
:
-
-	r0 =3D 0
-	r1 =3D 29	(this is the GraphicsClient architecture number)
-
-Linux can  be used with the ADS BootLoader that ships with the
-newer rev boards. See their documentation on how to load Linux.
-Angel is not available for the GraphicsClient Plus AFAIK.
-
-There is a  board known as just the GraphicsClient that ADS used to
-produce but has end of lifed. This code will not work on the older
-board with the ADS bootloader, but should still work with Angel,
-as outlined below.  In any case, if you're planning on deploying
-something en masse, you should probably get the newer board.
-
-If using Angel on the older boards, here is a typical angel.opt option fi=
le
-if the kernel is loaded through the Angel Debug Monitor::
-
-	base 0xc0200000
-	entry 0xc0200000
-	r0 0x00000000
-	r1 0x0000001d
-	device /dev/ttyS1
-	options "38400 8N1"
-	baud 115200
-	#otherfile ramdisk.gz
-	#otherbase 0xc0800000
-	exec minicom
-
-Then the kernel (and ramdisk if otherfile/otherbase lines above are
-uncommented) would be loaded with::
-
-	angelboot -f angelboot.opt zImage
-
-Here it is assumed that the board is connected to ttyS1 on your PC
-and that minicom is preconfigured with /dev/ttyS1, 38400 baud, 8N1, no fl=
ow
-control by default.
-
-If any other bootloader is used, ensure it accomplish the same, especiall=
y
-for r0/r1 register values before jumping into the kernel.

=2D- The flash on board is divided into 3 partitions.  mtd0 is where
-  the zImage is stored.  It's been marked as read-only to keep you
-  from blasting over the bootloader. :)  mtd1 is
-  for the ramdisk.gz image.  mtd2 is user flash space and can be
-  utilized for either JFFS or if you're feeling crazy, running ext2
-  on top of it. If you're not using the ADS bootloader, you're
-  welcome to blast over the mtd1 partition also.
-
=2D- 16bpp mode requires a different cable than what ships with the board.
-  Contact ADS or look through the manual to wire your own. Currently,
-  if you compile with 16bit mode support and switch into a lower bpp
-  mode, the timing is off so the image is corrupted.  This will be
-  fixed soon.

-Any contribution can be sent to nico@fluxnic.net and will be greatly welc=
ome!

-Itsy
-=3D=3D=3D=3D
-
-Itsy is a research project done by the Western Research Lab, and Systems
-Research Center in Palo Alto, CA. The Itsy project is one of several
-research projects at Compaq that are related to pocket computing.
-
-For more information, see:
-
-	http://www.hpl.hp.com/downloads/crl/itsy/
-
-Notes on initial 2.4 Itsy support (8/27/2000) :
-
-The port was done on an Itsy version 1.5 machine with a daughtercard with
-64 Meg of DRAM and 32 Meg of Flash. The initial work includes support for
-serial console (to see what you're doing).  No other devices have been
-enabled.
-
-To build, do a "make menuconfig" (or xmenuconfig) and select Itsy support=
.
-Disable Flash and LCD support. and then do a make zImage.
-Finally, you will need to cd to arch/arm/boot/tools and execute a make th=
ere
-to build the params-itsy program used to boot the kernel.
-
-In order to install the port of 2.4 to the itsy, You will need to set the
-configuration parameters in the monitor as follows::
-
-	Arg 1:0x08340000, Arg2: 0xC0000000, Arg3:18 (0x12), Arg4:0
-
-Make sure the start-routine address is set to 0x00060000.
-
-Next, flash the params-itsy program to 0x00060000 ("p 1 0x00060000" in th=
e
-flash menu)  Flash the kernel in arch/arm/boot/zImage into 0x08340000
-("p 1 0x00340000").  Finally flash an initial ramdisk into 0xC8000000
-("p 2 0x0")  We used ramdisk-2-30.gz from the 0.11 version directory on
-handhelds.org.
-
-The serial connection we established was at:
-
-8-bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit(s), 115200.00 b/s. in the monitor, in t=
he
-params-itsy program, and in the kernel itself.  This can be changed, but
-not easily. The monitor parameters are easily changed, the params program
-setup is assembly outl's, and the kernel is a configuration item specific=
 to
-the itsy. (i.e. grep for CONFIG_SA1100_ITSY and you'll find where it is.)
-
-
-This should get you a properly booting 2.4 kernel on the itsy.
