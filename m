In IMA hook, ima_process_key is checked without lock. If it is false, 
ima_queue_key is called. If the key was queued (by ima_queue_key()) then 
the hook defers measurement. Else, it processes it immediately.

In ima_queue_key() function the check for ima_process_key is done after 
taking the lock and the key queued if the flag is false.

In ima_process_keys() ima_process_key is set without lock and then the 
queued keys are moved to a temp list after taking the lock.

I have reviewed the changes myself and also with a few of my colleagues. 
I don't think there is a race condition. Please let me know if you do 
see a problem.

I can move the setting of ima_process_key flag inside the lock. But 
honestly I don't think that is necessary.

I agree that ima_process_keys should be static since it is used in this 
file one. I'll make that change.

I can also move the setting of ima_process_key flag inside the lock 
along with the above change.

thanks,
