Yes, and I haven't been able to get one yet, so I dropped my original
plan of supporting this once. The gpio device is very different.

the GPIO button should not work.
Talking about the old driver ? It only supports the three front LEDs
directly and conflicts w/ anything else that wants to support other
GPIOs.

Correct. If we really wanna support APUv1, that most likely become a
completely separate driver, as the chipsets are very different.

ACK.

APUv3 already is supported. APUv4 again is pretty different, and I don't
have one yet. (if anybody convices pcengines to give me some boards,
I'll add support for them :))

Already planned to add it, but not yet sorted into which subsystem it
actually belongs to.

First we'll have to sort out where the new pins actually belong into.
(maybe power management / regulators for the reset pins ?)

And it's an entirely different chipset, not related at all to apu.

Yes.
