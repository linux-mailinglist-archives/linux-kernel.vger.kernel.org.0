Bullet points just describe the resulting effect/benefits of the change to fix
the pipe control register update issue (see the referenced e-mail).

I can maybe split off the first bullet point into a separate patch. But
I can't guarantee it will not make the original issue worse, because it might
have been hiding the other issue with register updates.

The rest is just a result of the single logical change. It doesn't work
individually, it all has the goal of fixing the issue as a whole.

If I were to split it I would have to actually re-implement .atomic_disable
callback only to remove it in the next patch. I don't see the benefit.

regards,
	o.
