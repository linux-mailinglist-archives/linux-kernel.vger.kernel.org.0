I think the only patches that existed where for panel, and we only
discussed the bridge case. At least I can only find patches for panel,not
bridge, but might be missing something.

Either way I think device core is fixed now, so would be really great if
someone can give this another stab, and make drm_bridge/panel easier to
use without fireworks on unload.
