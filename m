So that kind of "review", where "I'm not an expert, but it looks good
to me", has very, very little value as far as I'm concerned.  A
computer program can do a "it builds, ship it" test, and checkpatch
can find the whitespace nits.  So what value does a "I can't consider
side-effects" review have?  Again, as a maintainer, I can put very
little (read: zero) reliance on it.

And my assertion is that if a patch does not affect multiple
subsystems, an Acked-by has close to zero value.  So why do it?  In my
opinion, we should tighten up the documentation to only use it for the
Maintainer reviewing a patch that's not flowing through the
Maintainer's tree.

We're using "reviewed" in two different ways.  I'm talking about an
empty "reviewed-by" or "acked-by", for which if it's an developer
unknown to me, I have no way of telling how much time they spent on
the review.  Was it 5 seconds?  Or 5 minutes?  Or something in
between?

You're saying that if someone sends a "Reviewed-by" or "Acked-by", I
*must* never drop it, even if I have no idea how much value it has
(and therefore, as far as I'm concerned, it has no value).  Sorry, I'm
not going to play things that way.  Feel free to call me bad if you
want, it's not going to change how I do things.

Worse, what value does it add if we record it for all posterity?  What
should someone who is reviewing the git log after the fact, perhaps a
year later, take from the fact that there is an unknowned Reviewed-By
or Acked-By attached to the commit?  Do you think someone reviewing a
commit year later will spend time crawling over the git history to
determine how many reviews someone has done?

(And if all maintainer's add empty Reviewed-by to their commit,
looking at Git histories might not tell you much anyway.  It cheapens
the Reviewed-by and Acked-by headers.  I consider part of the
maintianer's job to curate not just patches, but Reviewed-By and
Acked-by headers.)

And BTW, if the maintainer is using a non-rewinding git tree, and the
git has already been published on git.kernel.org, it's physically not
*possible* for them to add a late Reviewed-by, or Acked-by.  And I
think that's perfectly justifiable, since if the decision has already
been made to accept the commit, the Reviewed-By or Acked-By has no
value to the project.

But I don't *know* that someone has gone to the trouble to review a
patch.  If they made any kind of comment (positive or negative, or
evaluating tradeoffs), then I have some kind of signal about how much
time they spent reviewing the patch, and how much comprehension they
have about the patch.  This is why my metric is "value to the
subsystem / value to the project as a whole".

You yourself have asked me to count the number of Reviewed-by you have
as a sign of your technical ability.  Would you then want to make sure
that that signal isn't cheapened?

It's a question of developer history.  Not just of a particular patch,
but their reviewer history as a whole.  If Jan Kara or Andreas Dilger
or Lukas Czerner sends me a empty Reviewed-By, it has great weight,
because they've found issues with other patches in the past, and we've
had design discussions about what is the right way to fix a particular
issue.  But for a someone with whom I've never interacted before, and
all I get is a drive-by, empty Acked-by?  No, it's not going to get
included by me.  Sorry.
