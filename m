AFAICS, this is a non-issue: If hdlcdev_open() is called, it sets
info->netcount=1. If info->netcount!=0, mgslpc_open() will abort before
calling startup(). And if mgslpc_open() is called, it sets info->count=1,
causing hdlcdev_open() to fail before calling startup(). So no risk of
concurrency here.
