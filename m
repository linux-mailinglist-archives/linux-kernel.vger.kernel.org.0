Hmm... from:

	https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

This works since Python version 3.3. It sounds doable to use it.

Yet, if we'll be switching to this method, the script should check if
the version is 3.3 or newer. The logic inside get_sphinx_fname() would 
also require some changes, as it won't need to install anymore the 
virtualenv program for Python >= 3.3.
