Hi Stefan,

Thanks for reviewing patches! Glad to see that MSI is welcome.

Thanks for the guide.

Yes, we considered using a feature bit from 24~37 or above, while a 
concern is that,

the device which uses such bit only represents the behavior of mmio 
transport layer but not common behavior

of virtio device. Or am I missing some "transport" feature bit range?

We're trying to define the notification mechanism that, driver MUST read 
0x50 to get the notification configuration

and calculate the notify address. The writing case here is that, the 
notify address is just located here e.g. notify_base=0x50, notify_mul=0.

Originally, we want this 16-bit Read-Only, so we put some RO things 
together and separate

enable setting command to next register.

In order to improve performance/save register space,  we combine some 
data together.

For example, combine MSI cmd operator (e.g. enable/disable, vector 
setup) with argument (e.g. 1/0,  queue index).

But it seems we miss the consistency with QueueSel.  So do you think if 
the max queue number should be 32-bit,

which means it must be the same with QueueSel? If so, I guess we need 
some re-organization. :)

Read enable/disable state is in 0x0c0.
