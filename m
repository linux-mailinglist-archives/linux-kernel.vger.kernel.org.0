What if the enclave cannot proceed due to an unhandled exception so the 
execution has to get back to the C caller of the vDSO API?

It seems to me the caller has to preserve CSRs by itself, otherwise it 
cannot continue execution after any enclave exception. Passing @leaf in 
%ecx will allow saving/restoring CSRs in C by setjmp()/longjmp(), with 
the help of an exit handler. But if the C caller has already preserved 
CSRs, why preserve CSRs again inside the enclave? It looks to me things 
can be simplified only if the host process handles no enclave exceptions 
(or exceptions inside the enclave will crash the calling thread). Thus 
the only case of enclave EEXIT'ing back to its caller is considered 
valid, hence the enclave will always be able to restore CSRs, so that 
neither vDSO nor its caller has to preserve CSRs.

Is my understanding correct?
