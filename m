Please consider picking up just:
https://github.com/ojeda/linux/commit/c97e82b97f4bba00304905fe7965f923abd2d755
That lone patch is the one that fixes the particularly observed Oops.
The rest are just cleanup; if I made that change in the more important
patch, why not clean up the rest of the instances in the kernel?
