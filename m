Agreed that both p?d_large() and p?d_huge() should not exist at the same time
when they imply the same thing. I believe all these name proliferation happened
because THP, HugeTLB and kernel large mappings like linear, vmemmap, ioremap etc
which the platform code had to deal with in various forms.

The alternate name chosen p?d_leaf() is absolutely fine and it describes the
entry as intended. There is no disagreement over that. My original concern
was introduction of yet another page table helper.

Fair enough, that is another way. So you expect existing platform definitions
for p?d_large()/p?d_huge() getting cleaned up and to start using new p?d_leaf()
instead ?

All of those instances should migrate to using p?d_leaf() eventually else
there will be three different helpers which probably mean the same thing.
