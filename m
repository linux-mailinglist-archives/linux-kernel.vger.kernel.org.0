And another potential issue causing this is a CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL=y
kernel running in kernel mode (rcutorture on the one hand and callback
invocation on the other) for extended periods of time with the scheduling
clock disabled.  Just started the tests for this.  They will be running
for quite some time, which this week is a good thing.  ;-)
