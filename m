True, there is no technical reason.

I was only trying to simplify the setup and answer the outstanding questions.
- What alignment to use for reservations?
- What is minimum size of reservations?

If only one gigantic page size is supported, the answer is simple.  In any
case, I think input from arch specific code will be needed.
