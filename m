Hi Thomas,

I see what you mean now. Basically after the IPI is sent, the HT
sending the IPI would have buffers cleared before the attacker gets a
chance to run on it. Because the victim HT enters into the IPI
handler, all the attacker will get to see is possibly uninteresting
data (e.g. scheduler state) as you mentioned.

Thanks!
