Right, and that's also what that commit's description says remains as
non-conforming behavior.

I'm not the maintainer here, but to me it looks mostly okay.

I'm afraid you may neither convert a field width of zero to -1 here,
nor convert a field width of 1 to zero (unlimited).

I'd also like to note that the 'u' and 'x' format characters also accept
a sign as per the standard, but that's an orthogonal issue which you
may or may not want to address at the same time.
