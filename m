I meant to says that for the rotation case we can do as you did here, if
we do add() on a slave, add the master if it wasn't add()'ed yet.

I'm confused on what exactly you're trying to solve with the
first_active thing. The problem with the group event as master is that
you then _must_ schedule the whole group, which is obviously difficult.

It's still broken on -RT, because __perf_install_in_context() is in
hardirq context (IPI) and the allocator locks are spinlock_t.
