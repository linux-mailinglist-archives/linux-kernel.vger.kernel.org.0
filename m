Heh, doh, that's right. :)

Sorry, for some reason I misread that as "If the backing device of the
filesystem from which the inode came is a block device..."

Might I suggest rewording the first sentence of the comment to read "If
the loop device's backing device is itself a block device" for oafs like
me? :)
