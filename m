That's not really a fix since AFAICT CMA never worked properly on RPi4
with mainline. For 5.5, I queued the arm64 for-next/zone-dma patches
which would allow RPi4 to get a CMA in the correct physical address
range. However, since these patches cause a regression on other
platforms that don't need a small ZOEN_DMA, my suggestion was to leave
the CMA handling for RPi4 as per the current mainline (i.e. broken) and
allow CMA from the full ZONE_DMA32 range (second patch in this series).

IIUC, this dts patch can be merged independently of the ZONE_DMA patches
for arm64 and it may be beneficial for current mainline (even without
the arm64/for-next/zone-dma patches).

I'm happy to queue them together with your ack for 5.5, otherwise I'll
only pick the second patch in this series.

Thanks.
