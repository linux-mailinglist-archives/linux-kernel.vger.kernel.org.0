The framework is passing -EAGAIN to userspace which isn't very nice at
all. Luckily, handling it is pretty trival so I went ahead and made an
updated patch to address this. (I'm unsure of how to submit an update
to my patch so I'll need a bit of guidence on this.)

g.

Most of the old code was pulled from the framework anyway so it's very
unlikely that anything else would be dropped here.
