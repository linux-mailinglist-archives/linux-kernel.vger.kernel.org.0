Arnd originally gave me this idea for modelling the HiSilicon LPC driver 
as an I2C host, so he may know.

 From checking drivers/i2c/busses/Kconfig, maybe I2C_CROS_EC_TUNNEL 
could support LPC.

Maybe this will help:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/email-clients.rst

I use firefox in windows, since outlook cannot be configured for kernel 
posting style, AFAIK.
