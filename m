thanks for bringing this up!

Indeed.

No comment.

Right, that's easy and obvious.

The question is what we do with that information :)

Cute.

That's sloooow, but could at least provide an option to do so.

I doubt it. Clearing a bit in the IER takes the interrupt out of the
priority decision logic. That's a SVM feature so interrupts directed
directly to guests cannot block other interrupts if they are not
serviced. It's grossly misnomed and won't help with the int80 issue.

The more interesting question is whether this is all relevant. If I
understood the issue correctly then this is mitigated by proper interrupt
remapping.

Is there any serious usage of virtualization w/o interrupt remapping left
or have the machines which are not capable been retired already?

Thanks,
