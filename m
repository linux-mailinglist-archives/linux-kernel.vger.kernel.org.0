One obvious issue is the reclaim couters may not correct.
See shrink_inactive_list().
The pages relcaimed in memcg softlimit will not be counted to
PGSCAN_{DIRECT, KSWAPD} and
PGSTEAL_{DIRECT, KSWAPD}.
That may cause some misleading. For example, if these counters are not
changed, we will think that direct relcaim doesn't occur, while it
really occurs.

May issues are also in  some other code around the usage of
global_reclaim(). I'm not sure of it.
