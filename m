The approach we're looking at in this case is to keep huge entries 
write-protected and split them in the wp_huge_xxx() code's fallback path 
with the mmap_sem held. This means that there will actually be huge 
entries in the page-walking code soon, but as you say, only entries that 
we want to ignore and not split. So we'd also need a way to avoid the 
pagewalk splitting for the situation when someone faults a huge entry in 
just before the call to split_huge_xxx.

Yes. My take on this is that locking the PUD ptl can be done either with 
the mmap_sem or the i_mmap_lock if present and that we should update the 
asserts in xxx_trans_huge_lock to reflect that. But when actually 
splitting transhuge pages you don't want to race with khugepaged, so you 
need the mmap_sem. For the graphics VMAs (MIXEDMAP), khugepaged never 
touches them. Yet.

OK. Yes there are a number of various specialized pagewalks all over the 
mm code.

But another thing that worries me is that the page-table modifications 
that happen in the callback use functionality that is not guaranteed to 
be exported, and that mm people don't want them to be exported because 
you don't want the drivers to go hacking around in page tables, which 
means that the two callbacks used here would need to be a set of core 
helpers anyway.

So I figure what I would end up with would actually be an extern 
__walk_page_range anyway, and slightly modified asserts. Do you think 
that could be acceptible?

Thanks,

Thomas
