When BT is enabled as a wakeup source, there is no reset.

I don't know that it's significantly less (only that it's OFF). My
greater motivation is to make sure the bluetooth chip isn't
accumulating events while the host is turned off. Sorry, I should have
made that more clear in the cover letter.

When the host is off, it continues to accumulate events for the host
to process (packets from connected devices, LE advertisements, etc).
At some point, the firmware buffers fill up and no more events can be
stored. When the host is resumed later on, the firmware is in a bad
state and doesn't respond. I had originally just reset in ->resume but
then connected wireless devices wouldn't disconnect from the BT either
and I had trouble getting them to reconnect.

Probably (but I couldn't find a way to do that). I want to prevent
bluetooth from waking up the host and to reliably be in a good state
when the host resumes. The reset logic I implemented causes the hci
device to disappear and reappear, which userspace seems to handle
gracefully.
