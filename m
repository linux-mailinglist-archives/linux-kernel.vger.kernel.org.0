To be honest, I do not see how this could solve the problem.

The circular dependency is still there. If the new __down_trylock()
succeeds then console_unlock() will get called in the same context
and it will still need to call up() -> try_to_wake_up().

Note that there are many other console_lock() callers that might
happen in parallel and might appear in the wait queue.
