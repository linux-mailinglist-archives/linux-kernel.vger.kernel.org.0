Something like this would be good!

The other thing to track besides CPU time savings (which does look good!)
is memory footprint.

And there will also need to be something visible to RCU counting the
number of outstanding kfree()s.  But on a per-CPU basis, for example,
as an atomic_long_t field in the rcu_data structure or similar.  This
is needed to help RCU work out when it needs to work harder to bring
grace periods to an end.  But that can be a separate issue.

My guess is that performance does not depend all that much on the
exact number.  Does that match your testing?

So ->bcached keeps at most one kfree_rcu_bulk_data around for later use,
correct?  And ->bhead is where new memory is placed, while ->bhead_free
contains those waiting for a grace period, right?  (It would be good
to make the comment explicit about this.)

It should be possible to move this code out to follow the "Queue the
next" comment, thus avoiding the goto.  Setting krcp->bhead to NULL
here should set up for the check below, right?

Again nice improvement!  Please also check memory footprint.  I would
not expect much difference, but...
