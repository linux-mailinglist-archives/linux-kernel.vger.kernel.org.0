Keeping the infrastructure changes in separate commits would certainly
make the patches easier to work with for me. Keeping the commits
interleaved should be fine though: patch "iomap: zero newly allocated
mapped blocks" depends on "xfs: set IOMAP_F_NEW more carefully", so a
pure infrastructure branch without "xfs: set IOMAP_F_NEW more
carefully" probably wouldn't be correct.

Thanks,
Andreas
