Hi Steve,

It seems I missed this message...

I see. Would you mean the title is incorrect?

Agreed.

Sorry for confusion. Kprobes is using an exception (of course!). So the
title can mislead, it should be "in exception" instead of "in irq context",
However, current code checks it by "!in_task()", which includes both of
IRQ and exception. A better solution might change it to "in_irq()".

However, I could not find a way to distinguish the "exception" and
"external IRQ" by the execution context (based on the preempt count)
because exception is treated as a kind of IRQ.
Thus, in this patch, I changed it as not only checking what the context
is, but also whether it is appropriately called.


Thank you,
