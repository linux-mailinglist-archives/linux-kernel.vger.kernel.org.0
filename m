OK, I see. Most of the interconnect paths in the downstream MSM 3.4
sources are configured in device tree using the
qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps property, which is what I was only looking at
before. The interconnect path for the display is configured directly in
code (drivers/video/msm/mdss/mdss_mdp.c) to setup a path between
MSM_BUS_MASTER_MDP_PORT0 and MSM_BUS_SLAVE_EBI_CH0.

In the upstream kernel, it looks like I'll need to

  1) add support for an optional second interconnect path for ocmem to
     drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/adreno_gpu.c.

  2) add implementations of gpu_get_freq and gpu_get_freq to the
     adreno_gpu_funcs struct in drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a3xx_gpu.c.
