Hi Leo,

Two points here - both related.

Issue 1:

OK - it appears that cs_etm__instr_addr() is supposed to be returning
the address within the current trace sample of the instruction related
to offset.
For T32 - then if offset < 0, packet->start_addr is returned - not
good but at least within the current trace range
For A32/A64 - if offset < 0 then an address _before_
packet->start_addr is returned - clearly wrong and possibly a
completely invalid address that was never actually traced.

Issue 2:

Assuming I have understood the logic of this code correctly - there is
an issue were sample_period < period_instructions as you say -
but I believe the problem is in the logic of the sampling function itself.

Suppose we have a sample_period of 4.

Now on an initial pass through the function, period_instructions must
be 0. (i.e. none left over from the previous pass.)
Suppose also that the number of instructions executed in this sample
is 10 - thus updating period_instructions.
Therefore:
instr_over = 10 - 4 -> 6
offset = 10 - 6 - 1 -> 3.
We therefore call cs_etm_instr_addr to find the address an offset of 3
instructions from the start of the trace sample and synthesize the
sample.
After this we set period_instructions to the instr_over value of 6.

Next pass, assume 10 instructions in the trace sample again.
period_instructions = 6 + 10 -> 16
instr_over = 16 - 4 -> 12
offset = 10 - 12 - 1 -> -3  - the negative value your formulae predict.

This implies that the sample we want is actually in the previous trace
packet - which I believe is in fact the case - as explained below.

My reading of the code is that cs_etm__sample() is called once per
trace range packet extracted from the decoder - and a trace range
packet represents N instructions_executed.
Further I am assuming that instructions_sample_period represents the
desired periodicity of the instruction samples - i.e. 1 sample every
instructions_sample_period number of instructions.

Thus my conclusion here is that where M = instructions_executed +
period_instructions, the function should generate quotient ( M /
instructions_sample_period ) samples and set period_instructions to M
mod instructions_sample_period on exit, ensuring period_instructions
is never larger than the sample_period.

i.e. loop to generate multiple samples until instr_over and therefore
the output value of period_instructions is less than the value of
instructions_sample_period - for the example above, with 10
instructions and a periodicity of 4, we generate 2 samples with a
remainder of 2 instructions carried forwards.

In short leave offset as unsigned and fix the logic of the
cs_etm__sample() function.
