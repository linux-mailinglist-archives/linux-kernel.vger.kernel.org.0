is there any update on the testing with my patches? On the hardware I
had access to those patches helped, but I can't know if it also helped
on the hardware for which those workarounds where actually added.

that goes beside the point. firmware level workarounds for GPU driver
issues were pushed without consulting with upstream GPU developers.
That's something which shouldn't have happened in the first place. And
yes, I am personally annoyed by the fact, that people know about
issues, but instead of contacting the proper persons and working on a
proper fix, we end up with stupid firmware level workarounds. I can't
see why we ever would have wanted such workarounds in the first place.

And I would be much happier if the next time something like that comes
up, that the drm mailing list will be contacted as well or somebody
involved.

We could have also just disable the feature inside the driver (and
probably we should have done that a long time ago, so that is
essentially our fault, but still....)
