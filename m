Hmm, ok. i can drop list_del.

see the reason below to include list_del.

Thanks Evan,

Agree that code works even without this.

However from the same wiki,

 >>It is common to allocate sizeof(struct) + array_len*sizeof(array 
element) bytes.

 >>This is not wrong, however it may allocate a few more bytes than 
necessary:

this is what i wanted to convery above, currently it allocated 8 more 
bytes than necessary.

The reason for the change was one use after free reported in rpmh driver.

After including this change, we have not seen this reported again.

I can drop this change in new revision if we don't want it.

Thanks,

Maulik
