Sure. The problem is not the printk-pressure. The problem is you have
data-less records in your ringbuffer (from your previous
printk-pressure). If you used your own program that continued to read
after EPIPE, then you would see the sequence numbers jumping over the
data-less records.

Mainline doesn't have data-less records. In mainline such failed
printk's are silently ignored (after attepting truncation). So for
mainline you can only reproduce the overflow case.

1. Boot 5.6.0-rc1 (without any console= slowing down printk)

2. Fill the ringbuffer and let it overflow with:

   $ while true; do echo filling buffer > /dev/kmsg; done &

3. Once you can see the ringbuffer has overflowed (and continues to
   overflow), try to read from /dev/kmsg

   $ strace head /dev/kmsg

In most cases you will see:

read(3, 0x7f7307ac1000, 4096)           = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)

Current readers need to be able to handle EPIPE. cat(1) does not and so
(unfortunately) is not a good candidate for reading the ringbuffer.

I think it is appropriate for an application to close the descriptor
after an EPIPE. /dev/kmsg is special because the reader should continue
reading anyway.

Yes, but what does systemd-journald do when the EPIPE is _not_ returned
and instead there is a jump in the sequence number? Looking at
dev_kmsg_record(), systemd actually does it the way I would hope. It
tracks the sequence number correctly.

                               LOG_MESSAGE("Missed %"PRIu64" kernel messages",
                               serial - *s->kernel_seqnum),
                               NULL);

In mainline, with regard to /dev/kmsg, sequence numbers will never
jump. If there would be a jump (due to lost messages) then EPIPE is
issued. The reader can either:

1. continue reading and see the jump

2. reopen the file descriptor, possibly having missed a ton more
   messages due to reopening, and then start from the oldest available
   message

With my series, #2 is no longer an option because the lost messages
could exist in a part of the ringbuffer not yet overwritten.

If we remove EPIPE, then readers will need to track the sequence number
to identify jumps. systemd-journald does this already. And tools like
cat(1) would "just work" because cat does not care if messages were
lost.
