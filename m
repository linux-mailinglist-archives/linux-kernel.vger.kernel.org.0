And keep adding a sysfs file for each new variant and CVE?

Hell no.

IMO, what you want does not belong in sysfs but in documentation.

I partially see your point that a table of sorts mapping all those CPU
vulnerability names to (possible) mitigations is needed for users which
would like to know whether they're covered, without having to run some
scripts from github, but sysfs just ain't the place.

Again, this is only my opinion.
