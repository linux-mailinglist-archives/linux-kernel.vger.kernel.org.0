“They” refers to Realtek.
It’s their plan so I can’t really answer that on behalf of Realtek.

Yes. They use one single driver to support different SoCs, different  
architectures and even different OSes.
That’s why it’s a mess.

It’s virtually impossible because Realtek’s mega wifi driver uses tons of  
#ifdefs, only one chip can be selected to be supported at compile time.

Realtek plans to add the support in 2020, if everything goes well.
Meanwhile, many users of HP and Lenovo laptops are using out-of-tree  
driver, some of them are stuck to older kernels because they don’t know how  
to fix the driver. So I strongly think having this in kernel is beneficial  
to many users, even it’s only for a year.
