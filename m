Then it is exactly as I described previously, and Process A has it
mapped with a Normal Write-Back Cacheable mappping.

Process B requests a mapping of that memory via /dev/mem. It passes the
O_SYNC flag, and to ensure that accesses go to "the underlying hardware"
the kernel makes this mapping Normal Non-Cacheable (which means it
should not look in a cache, or be allocated into one).

The two mappings are not coherent because process A uses the cache, but
process B does not. This is the expected behaviour, consistent with the
semantic of O_SYNC. If you need the two to be coherent, they must both
use the same attributes.

Process B can be coherent with process A if it does *not* pass O_SYNC,
which would give it a Normal Write-Back Cacheable mapping that was
coherent with process A.

As above, this is not the case. O_SYNC causes the kernel to use a
non-cacheable mapping, where it would normally create a cacheable
mapping. i.e. O_SYNC *removes* cacheability.

It just happens that process A is using a cacheable mapping, which is
the case regardless of what process B does.

Thanks,
Mark.
