The point here being that you rely on .b.blocked rather than
.b.deferred_qs.  Hmmm...  There are a number of places that check all
the bits via the .s leg of the rcu_special union.  The .s check in
rcu_preempt_need_deferred_qs() should be OK because it is conditioned
on t->rcu_read_lock_nesting of zero or negative.

Do rest of those also work out OK?

It would be nice to remove the flag, but doing so clearly needs careful
review and testing.
