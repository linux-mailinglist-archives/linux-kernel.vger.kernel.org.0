But that's the part I'm not buying - there's no clear advantage to 
pushing that complexity down into the PMCG driver, vs. leaving the IORT 
code responsible for translating an SMMU model into a PMCG model, yet 
the aforementioned disadvantages jump out right away.

Hooray, I guess :)

The associated SMMU has no relevance in that context - the reason for 
the Node Reference to point to a non-SMMU node is for devices that 
implement their own embedded TLB (e.g. AMBA DTI masters) and expose a 
standard PMCG interface to monitor it. It isn't reasonable to expect any 
old PCIe controller or on-chip-accelerator driver to expose a fake SMMU 
IIDR just to keep some other driver happy.

That assumption does technically fail already - I know MMU-600 has 
different IMP-DEF events for its TCU and TBUs, however as long as we can 
get as far as "this is some part of an MMU-600" the driver should be 
able to figure out the rest (annoyingly it looks like both PMCG types 
expose the same PMCG_ID_REGS information, but they should be 
distinguishable by PMCG_CEIDn).

Right, that was largely my point - DT probing can start with a PMCG 
model, so it's a lot more logical for ACPI probing to do the same, with 
the actual PMCG model determination hidden away in the ACPI code. That's 
the basis of the current design.

I have been nagging the architects that PMCGs not having their own IIDR 
is an unwelcome hole in the spec, so hopefully this might get a bit 
easier some day.

MMU-600 has its TCU PMCG page 0 in the middle of its SMMU page 0 space, 
but given that it's an Arm IP, I expect that when the heat gets turned 
up for making it work, it's most likely to be under me ;)
