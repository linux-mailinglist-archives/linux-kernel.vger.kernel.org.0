I would take the saying of non zero risk for breaking existing parsers.
When considering this change, I thought about the possible risk. However,
found out the per-node stats was added in 2016 which is not so late, and
assume nobody will rely on the order of per-node stats embeded into a
zone. But I have to admit any concern or worry of risk is worth being
considerred carefully since /proc/zoneinfo is a classic interface.

So, in view of objections from you and David, I would like to drop this
patch and patch 5. It's a small improvement, not worth taking any risk.
But if it goes back to this time of 2017, I would like to spend some
time to defend it :-)
