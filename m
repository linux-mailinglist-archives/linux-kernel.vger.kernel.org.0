OK, let me go through your detailed list

reset-lantiq uses bit bit positions for specifying the reset line.
for example this is from OpenWrt's vr9.dtsi:
  reset0: reset-controller@10 {
    ...
    reg = <0x10 4>, <0x14 4>;
    #reset-cells = <2>;
  };

  gphy0: gphy@20 {
    ...
    resets = <&reset0 31 30>, <&reset1 7 7>;
    reset-names = "gphy", "gphy2";
  };

in my own words this means:
- all reset0 reset bits are at offset 0x10 (parent is RCU)
- all reset0 status bits are at offset 0x14 (parent is RCU)
- the first reset line uses reset bit 31 and status bit 30
- the second reset line uses reset bit 7 and status bit 7
- there can be multiple reset-controller instances, each taking the
reset and status offsets (OpenWrt's vr9.dtsi specifies the second RCU
reset controller "reset1" with reset offset 0x48 and status offset
0x24)

it was moved to the .dts instead of the arch code. again from
OpenWrt's vr9.dtsi [0]:
  reboot {
    compatible = "syscon-reboot";
    regmap = <&rcu0>;
    offset = <0x10>;
    mask = <0xe0000000>;
  };

this sets the reset0 reset bits 31, 30 and 29 at reboot

I didn't know that. so to confirm I understand this correctly:
- some reset lines must be asserted and de-asserted manually (setting
and clearing the bit manually). the _assert and _deassert functions
should be used in this case
- other reset lines only support reset pulses. the _reset function
should be used in this case
- the _reset function should only assert the reset line, then wait
until the hardware automatically de-asserts it (without any further
write)

is this the same for all, old and new SoCs?

only two mainline Lantiq drivers are using reset lines - both are
using the _assert and _deassert variants:
- drivers/net/dsa/lantiq_gswip.c
- drivers/phy/lantiq/phy-lantiq-rcu-usb2.c

> 4. Code not optimized and intel internal review not assessed.
insights from you (like the issue with the reset callback) are very
valuable - this shows that we should focus on having one driver.

my concern with having two separate drivers is that it will be hard to
migrate from reset-lantiq to the "optimized" reset-intel-syscon
driver.
I don't have access to the datasheets for the any Lantiq/Intel SoC
(VRX200 and even older).
so debugging issues after switching from one driver to another is
tedious because I cannot tell which part of the driver is causing a
problem (it's either "all code from driver A" vs "all code from driver
B", meaning it's hard to narrow it down).
with separate commits/patches that are improving the reset-lantiq
driver I can do git bisect to find the cause of a problem on the older
SoCs (VRX200 for example)

> What is your opinion?
I explained why I would like to avoid having two separate drivers
(even just for a limited amount of time)
