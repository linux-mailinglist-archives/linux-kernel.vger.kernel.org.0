You know, I am no longer sure... perhaps it is even worse, I need to recheck.

Yes, yes, I know.

I tried ;) this was my initial reaction to this bug report.

However,

Yes, but with the current implementation you do not need to construct
such a program, this is what you can easily get "in practice". And this
confuses people.

They can watch /proc/pid/stat incrementally and (when the numbers are big)
find that a program that runs 100% in userspace somehow spends 10 minutes
almost entirely in kernel. Or at least more in kernel than in userspace.
Even if task->stime doesn't grow at all.
