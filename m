Agreed. I can see the point of not wanting to write an exception into
checkpatch for every exception of it's general rules; however, it
would be nice if there was a way to maybe have a special comment or
something that could turn off a checkpatch error. That way, a
checkpatch error/warning always means some action should be taken, and
if a rule is being ignored, there is always documentation as to why.

Otherwise, I don't feel strongly about this.

Cheers
