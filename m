No argument, but at the same time, it is now used in arch, mips, and
powerpc. I suspect there is no going back.

Right now, it is an early_param in init/do_mounts_initrd.c, hence part
of core. It came in with b1ab95c6 in 11/2018, which is what drew us to
it initially.

On some systems, we now have LInuxBoot running on the ARM board
controller (BMC) AND on the x86 as well, and keeping some conformance
of booting and command line structure has a high value. There's a
reason this patch is so small: all the bits I needed are in the kernel
already. If I use initrd= on the kernel command line, and
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is set, the kernel variables are set, on all
architectures.

Google, facebook, and others are now deploying LinuxBoot into their
data centers; IoT companies are building on it; manufacturers are
using it; aerospace companies too.  We have need of this kind of
capability. We chose this way of doing it after looking at a lot of
options, including ACPI. Many of the smaller companies we work with
also use ARM, and prefer this method to using ACPI, because then it's
one less point of difference.

> Note that when Linux is run as an UEFI binary the kernel UEFI stub can load an initrd file via the UEFI file I/O interface.

As part of our deployment of LinuxBoot, we are removing all UEFI
components we can, including those that implement file system and disk
I/O. They represent attack surface. So that's not an option.

Besides, the initrd is in reclaimed flash anyway, not a disk. UEFI can
only load components from a firmware volume and, as mentioned, to make
the reclaimed space available for UEFI to use we have to recompile
from source or write a UEFI driver to add that reclaimed space to the
firmware volume at startup -- undesirable and, for most places,
impossible.

Further, some companies (e.g. facebook) are looking to deploy
FSP/coreboot on x86, so using UEFI components to load initrd is a
short-term, dead-end effort.

> In some ways, arguably the Right Thing for the firmware to expose this would be to have a resource exposed via ACPI .

Arguably true, but we've found a real reluctance among our partners to
get involved with ACPI. Further, many of them work with ARM, and feel
that given this works today on ARM, it would be nice to have it work
on x86. While it is true that the bootloaders such as syslinux, grub,
etc. have initrd in their namespace, in LinuxBoot systems we don't
have those bootloaders. Linux is our bootloader.

I don't expect ARM/powerpc/MIPS communities to give initrd= up; it's
already in core; I can put it on a command line for a FLASH-installed
x86 Linux kernel and it will be processed, and those variables will be
set. It's ubiquity is what makes it so attractive. It's wonderfully
convenient, especially in test situations, where I might netboot a
kernel but tell it to use the initramfs in flash.

So, how do we move forward? If it's just not possible to have initrd=
mean something to the x86 kernel, as it does to other architectures,
is a different name OK? That's a bit less attractive, as it puts us in
"when on x86, do this; on all others, the standard initrd= parameter
works" mode. But if that's what it takes, we'll do it. physinitrd?
initrdaddr? something else?

We do need this. We're rolling systems into datacenters and at some
point the need for this is a blocker. So I'd like to get this figured
out.

Thanks for anything you can do.
