Sorry, I have very small knowledge in Documentation stuff. So I was
thinking no need my input...

I don't know what markup is proper here. My opinion would be, let's
make it be consistent with other Documents/*.

Those sections are so long years didn't work, IIRC. So IMHO, we can
remove those simply. The address for bug report would work from
MAINTAINER, lkml as usual, and even bugzilla.
