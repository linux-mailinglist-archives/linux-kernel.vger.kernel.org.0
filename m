Changing NCAPINTS is heavy lifting to only solve this biset issue. After
applying patch 0003, the word 12 hole generated in patch 0002 is filled
in and no issue reported. If changing NCAPINTS in patch 0002, it needs to
be changed back again after applying 0003.

How about add this patch in patch 0002? I posted this patch in this thread
just now and post it here again:

diff --git a/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h b/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h
index 526619906305..403f70c2e431 100644
--- a/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h
+++ b/arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeature.h
@@ -23,6 +23,7 @@ enum cpuid_leafs
 	CPUID_7_0_EBX,
 	CPUID_D_1_EAX,
 	CPUID_LNX_4,
+	CPUID_DUMMY,
 	CPUID_8000_0008_EBX,
 	CPUID_6_EAX,
 	CPUID_8000_000A_EDX,

Adding this small patch into patch 0002 will solve the build errors without
changing the build checks.

Thanks.
