I'll use it where the code as written is correct while the tool
complains about it.

OK, so KCSAN knows about same-value-stores? If so, that ->cpu =
smp_processor_id() case really doesn't need annotation, right?

I'm still hoping to convince you that the other case is one of those
'simple-rules' too :-)
