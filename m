Hi Robin,

I was wondering if you have had a chance to consider this problem again?

One simple idea could be to introduce a device link between the endpoint 
device and its parent bridge to ensure that they probe in order, as 
expected in pci_device_group():

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: Add device link to ensure endpoint device driver 
probes after bridge

It is required to ensure that a device driver for an endpoint will probe
after the parent port driver, so add a device link for this.

This would work, but the problem is that if the port driver fails in 
probing - and not just for -EPROBE_DEFER - then the child device will 
never probe. This very thing happens on my dev board. However we could 
expand the device links API to cover this sort of scenario.

As for alternatives, it looks pretty difficult to me to disassociate the 
group allocation from the dma_configure path.

Let me know.

Thanks,
John
