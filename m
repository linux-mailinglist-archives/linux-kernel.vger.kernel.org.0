May be to some/small extent.

1. max_rx_timeout_ms is firmware dependent, maximum time it expects to
   complete a synchronous request or acknowledge async request(worst case value).
2. max_msg_size is maximum size of the buffer we need to allocate, mostly
   based on the specification and we don't have any more that 0x80. But
   the custom/vendor specific protocols may wary and hence I thought of
   keeping it configurable for platforms.
3. max_msg is the maximum number of messages the transport can support.
   This is currently based on the mailbox layer. For SMC/HVC we can have
   upto nr_cpus, something different for spci/optee. We must be able to
   make it transport independent if required.

   This is mainly used to pre-allocate number of (tx/rx) buffers.
