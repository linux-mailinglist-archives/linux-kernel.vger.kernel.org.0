The reason why I did not use memremap() was because I was convinced
that there will soon be physical devices such as PD controllers that
supply the interface, and with those the memory resource given to the
driver would be real bus memory. But that was already years ago,
and there still are no such devices that I know of, so if you guys
want to change the driver so that it uses memremap() instead of
ioremap(), I'm not going to be against it. But just be warned: We can
not guarantee that there isn't going to be IO side effects in every
case.

But why is the UCSI ACPI mailbox a problem for you guys? Why do you
have the UCSI ACPI device object in your ACPI tables in the first
place?
