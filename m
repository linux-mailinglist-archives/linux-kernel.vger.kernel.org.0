Both idle_purr and idle_spurr complement each other and we need to expose both of them.
It will improve the accounting accuracy of tools currently consuming system-wide PURR
and/or SPURR numbers to report system usage.  Deriving one from another, from my
experience makes it hard for tools or any custom scripts to give an accurate system view.
One tool I am aware of is lparstat, which uses PURR based metrics.
