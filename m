That looks like R_X86_64_32S which is:

"The linker must verify that the generated value for the R_X86_64_32
(R_X86_64_32S) relocation zero-extends (sign-extends) to the original
64-bit value."

Please add that to the commit message.

That I missed...

Needs to go into the commit message.

Yes, a shorter version of that should be part of the commit message too.

Ok, thanks for explaining.

Now please add that more detailed explanation to your commit message so
that people doing git archeology in the future can gather from it what
the problem was and what the solution became and why.

Also, add the reviewed- and tested-by flags you got from people.

Thx.
