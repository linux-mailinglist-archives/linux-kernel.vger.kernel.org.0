Interesting point, this I did not know.

This is the first thing that I've tested - I've selected the new
regulator as built-in, and it is fully operable.

I guess (although to 100% sure), that this is exactly the reason why
this regulator remains operable - it does have neither source nor
constraints, therefore it remains enabled.

I've stumbled upon those platforms, specifically when I was searching
for information about the sdmmc interface. It looks like that they all
are affected by this missing vqmmc piece, since a lot of people have
raised complaints some SD Cards are not recognized.

This is rather trivial: with the absence of 1.8v on the interface,
UHS-I cards are failing during the speed switch sped in
initialization. If you would plug in the UHS-I SD Card in the slot,
then driver outputs the error message in dmesg:
mmc2: error -110 whilst initialising SD card

Error codes returned are either ETIMEDOUT or EILSEQ, depending on how
the SD Card controller handles improper voltages on interface.

With the patch applied, when UHS-I card is inserted, following message
in recorded in dmesg:
mmc2: new ultra high speed SDR104 SDHC card at address aaaa

SDR104 mode is only for UHS-capable cards (Grade I and above); that
message is for example recorded when SanDisk Extreme 32GB card is
inserted. I've also tested different other cards from Verbatim,
Swissbit and SanDisk, and they all were recognized OK.

BTW, as a side note: there is a way to disable 1.8v switching in mmc
sub-system via quirks2, this makes all UHS-I cards to operate as High
Speed (HS) cards at 3.3v IO level. This is rather a hack, but people
using the CHT-based products tend to do exactly that (or at least this
is a common solution proposed in Internet).

As for sysfs attributes: I actually didn't look into those to really
tell you which values for which parameters would definitely
distinguish UHS cards and settings from HS ones.
