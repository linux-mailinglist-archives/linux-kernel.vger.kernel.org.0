I have given you a solution which you dont like. I have asked you to
talk to your colleagues at Intel, I have not heard back. I cant do
anymore than this.

testing on QC boards doesnt make sense, the contention is
'sdw_master_driver' which doesnt get used. I have said earlier, will say
again, if you drop this piece I am ready to apply the rest of the
patches.
