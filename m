The messages come from your shell (e.g. bash).  The process exits with a
status that means "I was killed by signal XX", and bash reports that.

In these cases, NFS does a 'killable' wait.  That means that only way to
interrupt the wait is to kill the process (so that it dies).
One justification for this is that there is no error that POSIX allows
stat (or other calls) to return if it takes "too long".  So the
systemcall cannot just fail - instead the whole process needs to die.

So you want your monitoring process to fork, and then access the
filesystem from the child.  If that takes too long, kill the child from
the parent - or set an alarm in the child and let it kill itself.

The parent can then respond to th fact that the child didn't exit
cleanly.
