Luckily, qemu refuses to start a guest on two different CPU types.

That's my preference as well.

I don't really think it's worth the hassle. This could even be racy
(32-bit guest starting at the same time with a CPU being onlined), so it
needs extra care.

If you have such platform, just make sure that you don't have
incompatible CPUs coming up late (during boot it should be fine).

We should improve (remove) the warnings for things we know the kernel
can handled during boot. For example, 32-bit not available on all CPUs
during boot should be fine as we just disable the feature. However, late
onlining of a CPU that does not support the already advertised features
should be blocked.
