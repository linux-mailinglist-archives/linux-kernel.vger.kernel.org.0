This advice is obsolete and slightly harmful for filesystems from this
millenium: any modern filesystem can handle unexpected crashes without
requiring fsck -- and on the other hand, trying to write to the disk when
the kernel is in a bad state risks introducing corruption.

For ext2, any unsafe shutdown meant widespread breakage, but it's no longer
a reasonable filesystem for any non-special use.

+``reboot(b)`` is good when you're unable to shut down, it is an equivalent

 ``crash(c)`` can be used to manually trigger a crashdump when the system is hung.
 Note that this just triggers a crash if there is no dump mechanism available.
 
-``sync(s)`` is great when your system is locked up, it allows you to sync your

-OK or Done message...)
+``sync(s)`` is handy before yanking removable medium or after using a rescue

+``umount(u)`` can be used to mark filesystems as properly unmounted. From the
