Yes, you are absolutely right. I'll defint it as (12*32+ 5).

There are two varialbes defined in cpuinfo_x86: x86_cache_max_rmid and
x86_cache_occ_scale. c->x86_cache_max_rmid is read from CPUID.0xf.1:ECX
and c->x86_cache_occ_scale is read from CPUID.0xf.1:EBX.

After getting X86_FEATURE_CQM_* from scattered, the two variables need
to be read from CPUID again. So the code of reading the two variables
need to be moved from before init_scattered_cpuid_features(c) to after
the function. This make the get_cpu_cap() code awkward.

And the two variables are ONLY used in resctrl monitoring configuration.
There is no need to store them in cpuinfo_x86 on each CPU.

I'm thinking to simplify and clean this part of code:

1. In patch #1:
- remove the definitions of x86_cache_max_rmid and x86_cache_occ_scale
from cpuinfo_x86
- remove assignment of c->x86_cache_max_rmid and c->x86_cache_occ_scale
from get_cpu_cap(c)
- get r->mon_scale and r->num_rmid in rdt_get_mon_l3_config(r) directly
from CPUID.0xf.1:EBX and CPUID.0xf.1:ECX.
2. In patch #2: do steps 1+2 to recycle word 11. After patch #1, I can
totally remove the code to get c->x86_cache_max_rmd and
c->x86_cache_occ_scale in get_cpu_cap(c). And patch #2 is cleaner.
3. In patch #3: add new word 12 to host CPUID.7.1:EAX

Do you think the patch #1 is necessary and this is a right patch set?

Thanks.
