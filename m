This trace shows a good write IO order because the writeback IOs are
queued to block layer serially from the 'cp' task and writeback wq.

However, writeback IO order is changed in current linus tree because
the IOs are queued to block layer concurrently from the 'cp' task
and writeback wq. It might be related with killing queue_congestion
by blk-mq.

The performance effect could be not only on this specific USB drive,
but also on all HDD., I guess.

However, I still can't reproduce it in my VM even though I built it
with similar setting of Andrea's test machine. Maybe the emulated disk
is too fast than Andrea's.

Andrea, can you collect the following log when running the test
on current new(bad) kernel?

=09/usr/share/bcc/tools/stackcount  -K blk_mq_make_request

Thanks,
Ming
