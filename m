In fact, there is only one reset controller for all SoCs even it doesn't 
prevent software from virtualizing multiple reset controllers. Reset 
control does include some misc stuff which has been moved to chiptop in 
new SoCs so that RCU has a clean job.

All SoCs have only one global software reset bit.
