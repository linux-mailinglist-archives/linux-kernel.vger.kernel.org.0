Hello BDFL,

Your email client did something strange by changing

	linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
to
	"linux-alpha@vger.kernel.org" <linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org>

which is odd  ;-)


As for your actual remark, I note that Olof has an arm/late branch
(which I assume he plans to submit in a few days?) which contains
the change you mention:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm/arm-soc.git/log/?h=arm/late
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm/arm-soc.git/commit/?h=arm/late&id=5cb9de627e25421e2e2edaff6360c84d32cd3c02

Regards.
