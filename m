The problem isn't quite the same, but it's a similar shape. See below
for more details.

The barrier isn't pointless, but we are relying on a subtlety that is
not captured in LKMM, as one of the observers involved is the TLB (and
associated page table walkers) of the CPU.

Until the PTE written by CPU 0 has been observed by the TLB of CPU 1, it
is not possible for CPU 1 to satisfy loads from the memory that PTE
maps, as it doesn't yet know which memory that is.

Once the PTE written by CPU has been observed by the TLB of CPU 1, it is
possible for CPU 1 to satisfy those loads. At this instant, CPU 1 must
respect the smp_wmb() before the PTE was written, and hence sees zeroes
written before this. Note that if this were not true, we could not
safely swap userspace memory.

There is the risk (as laid out in [1]) that CPU 1 attempts to hoist the
loads of the shadow memory above the load of the PTE, samples a stale
(faulting) status from the TLB, then performs the load of the PTE and
sees a valid value. In this case (on arm64) a spurious fault could be
taken when the access is architecturally performed.

It is possible on arm64 to use a barrier here to prevent the spurious
fault, but this is not smp_read_barrier_depends(), as that does nothing
for everyone but alpha. On arm64 We have a spurious fault handler to fix
this up.

Thanks,
Mark.
