Do you have any feedback about this? As far as I understand, there are
two options on the table right now:

1) Add support for the duty cycle to the qcom clk driver and write a
   general purpose clk-vibra driver for the input subsystem.

2) Do what Linus suggests above. We can use v1 of this series from last
   September (see below for link) that adds this to the pwm subsystem.
   The locking would need to be added so that it won't conflict with the
   clk subsystem. This can be tied into the input subsystem with the
   existing pwm-vibra driver.

Either case, the msm-vibrator driver that I added to the input subsystem
will be dropped.

Thanks,

Brian
