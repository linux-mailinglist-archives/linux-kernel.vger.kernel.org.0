We think it only has free stack to find out the root cause. Maybe we can
refer to other people's experience and ideas.

Don't worry it.
1. Our feature option has this description about last stack of page.
when consumer enable our feature, they should know the changing.
2. We add to print text message for alloc or free stack before dump the
stack of page. so consumers should know what is it.

Actually, We want to slim memory usage instead of increasing the memory
usage at another mail discussion. Maybe, maintainer or reviewer can
provide some ideas. That will be great.
