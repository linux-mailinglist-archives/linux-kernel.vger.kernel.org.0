Yes.  And with the direct mapping it also isn't an issue.

I guess that would actually work ok, but I prefer the more verbose
version as it explain what is going on, and will lead people to do
the right thing if we split the iommu vs passthrough case into
different ops (we already had a patch for that out on the list).

At least for some of the legacy SCSI drivers that is intentional, and
the reason why dma_get_required_mask was originally added.  On actual
PCI (and PCI-X, but not PCIe which everyone uses now) the 64-bit
addressing even if supported is not very efficient as it needs two
bus cycles.  So we prefer to just use the iommu.

etnaviv is never used on systems with the intel iommu anyway.

That just passes through the dma ops to work around really stupid
intel chipsets.
