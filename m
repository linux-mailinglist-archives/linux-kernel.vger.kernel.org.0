By listening these comm change events, user is able to monitor and control
specific threads that they are interested. For instance, a process control
daemon listening to proc connector and following comm value policies can
place specific threads to assigned cgroup partitions (quota from commit
 f786ecba415888 ("connector: add comm change event report to proc
 connector")).  It's harmless as user ignore the threads with names that
they are not interested.

It's indeed necessary to fix the concurrence problem. I will submit
a v2 patch when I fix this.

Thanks for your review and advise.
