Huh? If you understand that the syscore shutdown hook is too early, why 
would it seem a good idea to pull the plug even earlier from driver 
shutdown? Not to mention that your patch as proposed breaks all the 
GPIO-based shutdown flows.

If you really care about avoiding the spurious warning, implement the 
expected polled-mode transfer function in the I2C driver. Trying to hack 
around it by issuing I2C-based shutdown from anywhere other than 
pm_power_off is a waste of everyone's time.

As mentioned before, that likely has nothing to do with the PMIC, and 
really sounds like the issue with Trusted Firmware not reenabling all 
the SoC power domains before reset - a fix for that has already been 
identified, see here:
