I'm not really understanding what the pagetable base gets used for here and,
to be honest with you, the whole thing feels like a huge layering violation
with the way things are structured today. Why doesn't the caller just
interface with io-pgtable directly?

Finally, if we need to support context-switching TTBR0 for a live domain
then that code really needs to live inside the SMMU driver because the
ASID and TLB management necessary to do that safely doesn't belong anywhere
else.
