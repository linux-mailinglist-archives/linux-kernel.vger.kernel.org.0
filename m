Yes it's being done, and quite frankly Bhaskar, this e-mail as well as
all your other automated ones ("thanks a bunch") after each and every
release do not bring any value and only add noise, particularly when
developers are directly CCed. You should avoid this because you're
training developers to systematically ignore your messages and the day
you have a real question or issue to report, nobody will notice nor
respond.

Just my two cents,
Willy
