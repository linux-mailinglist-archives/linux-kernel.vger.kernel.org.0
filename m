It's actually a more simple heap type IMHO, but the logic inside is
incompatible with the system/CMA heaps, if you move any of their code
into the core framework then this heap stops working. Leading to out of
tree hacks on the core to get it back functional. I see the same for the
"complex" heaps with ION.
