> The qcom,dispcc bindings had a few problems with them:
>=20
> 1. They didn't specify all the clocks that dispcc is a client of.
>    Specifically on sc7180 there are two clocks from the DSI PHY and
>    two from the DP PHY.  On sdm845 there are actually two DSI PHYs
>    (each of which has two clocks) and an extra clock from the gcc.
>    These all need to be specified.
>=20
> 2. The sdm845.dtsi has existed for quite some time without specifying
>    the clocks.  The Linux driver was relying on global names to match
>    things up.  While we should transition things, it should be noted
>    in the bindings.
>=20
> 3. The names used the bindings for "xo" and "gpll0" didn't match the
>    names that QC used for these clocks internally and this was causing
>    confusion / difficulty with their code generation tools.  Switched
>    to the internal names to simplify everyone's lives.  It's not quite
>    as clean in a purist sense but it should avoid headaches.  This
>    officially changes the binding, but that seems OK in this case.
>=20
> Also note that I updated the example.
