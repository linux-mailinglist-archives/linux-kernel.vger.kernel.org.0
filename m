What do you mean by that ? I would prefer to drop the above line unless
I am missing something. IMO it contradicts the previous statement less
you elaborate more on this.

I assume you refer to asynchronous communication from OS to firmware in the
above statement and "not asynchronous notification" from firmware to OS.

Not sure if reference to SCMI is needed at all but I don't have any
objections to it, just thought worth mentioning.

Other than the above points, I am fine with it. Once fixed,

Note I haven't reviewed the yaml scheme, but just binding in general.
