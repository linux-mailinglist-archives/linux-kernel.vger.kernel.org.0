Debian doesn't currently have any other way of detecting ABI changes
(other than eyeballing diffs).

I know there have been proposals of using libabigail for this instead,
but I'm not sure how far those progressed.

Right, for example the KVM kABI is only meant for in-tree modules (like
kvm_intel) and in Debian we do not change the "ABI version" and require
rebuilding out-of-tree modules just because that ABI changes.=20
Currently we maintain explicit lists of exported symbols and exporting
modules for which we ignore ABI changes at build time.

[...]

Sometimes it is just a single function that changes, but often a
structure change can affect large numbers of functions.  For example,
if KVM adds a member to an operations struct that can indirectly change
the ABI for most of its exported functions.  We wouldn't want to change
the ABI version but would still want to prevent loading mismatched kvm
and kvm_intel versions.  It would be a lot more work to change all of
the affected function names.

An alternative to symbol version matching that I think would work for
us is: if a module's exports or imports match the "changes ignored"
list then the module can only be loaded on the exact version of the
kernel, otherwise it only needs to match the ABI version.  I think that
would avoid the need for carrying symbol versions, but we would still
need a build-time ABI check and a way of flagging which symbols need
the tighter version match.
