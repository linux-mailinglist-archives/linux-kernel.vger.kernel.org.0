I get the feeling this is going to be trickier than x86 switch tables
(which have already been tricky enough).

On x86, there's a .rela.rodata section which applies relocations to
.rodata.  The presence of those relocations makes it relatively easy to
differentiate switch tables from other read-only data.  For example, we
can tell that a switch table ends when either a) there's not a text
relocation or b) another switch table begins.

But with arm64 I don't see a deterministic way to do that, because the
table offsets are hard-coded in .rodata, with no relocations.

From talking with Kamalesh I got the impression that we might have a
similar issue for powerpc.

So I'm beginning to think we'll need compiler help.  Like a GCC plugin
that annotates at least the following switch table metadata:

- Branch instruction address
- Switch table address
- Switch table entry size
- Switch table size

The GCC plugin could write all the above metadata into a special section
which gets discarded at link time.  I can look at implementing it,
though I'll be traveling for two out of the next three weeks so it may
be a while before I can get to it.
