I think it would be really helpful to describe why the preemption was
disabled in that path. Some of that is explained in the comment but the
changelog should mention that explicitly.

This doesn't seem to have anything to do with the patch. Have you
considered to make it a patch on its own? Btw. I find this comment very
useful!

s@migration@cpu migration@ because migration without on its own is quite
ambiguous, especially in the MM code where it usually refers to memory.
