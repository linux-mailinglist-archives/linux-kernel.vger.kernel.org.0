FWIW the other pieces of ZONE_DEVICE are now due to land in parallel, 
but as long as we don't throw the ARCH_ENABLE_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE switch 
then there should still be no issue. Besides, given that we should 
consistently ignore the altmap everywhere at the moment, it may even 
work out regardless.

One thing stands out about the failure path thing, though - if 
__add_pages() did fail, can it still be guaranteed to have initialised 
the memmap such that page_zone() won't return nonsense? Last time I 
looked that was still a problem when removing memory which had been 
successfully added, but never onlined (although I do know that 
particular case was already being discussed at the time, and I've not 
been paying the greatest attention since).

Robin.
