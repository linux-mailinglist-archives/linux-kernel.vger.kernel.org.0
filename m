I would prefer to split it:

    + printk.c is already too big and would deserve splitting.

    + The two different kmgs interfaces are confusing on its
      own. IMHO, it will be even more confusing when they
      live in one huge source file.

It would be lovely from my POV. I am only concerned about
the lockless printk() stuff. I would prefer to avoid creating
too many conflicts in the same merge window. Well, I am
not sure how many conflicts there would be. Adding John
