I have found an .irq_ack callback - moving this there appears to work.

Alternatively there is an irq_eoi callback and an IRQCHIP_EOI_IF_HANDLED
flag.

It would really help me if you spelled out explicitly where you think I
should be moving code, as the documentation in irq.h is not all that
helpful in terms of when are they called and what should be done there.
In case not obvious, this is my first irqchip driver.

Renaming enable -> unmask and disable -> mask works okay.
