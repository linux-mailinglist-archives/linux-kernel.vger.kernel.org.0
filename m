Subject: [PATCH 2/6] ARM: dts: pxa: Switch to SPDX header
Date:   Tue, 11 Jun 2019 09:29:17 +0200

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The original license text had a typo ("publishhed") which would be
likely to confuse automated licensing auditing tools. Let's just switch
to SPDX instead of fixing the wording.
