So I'm not really sure where you want to go with this.

That clock is only useful where you're having a firmware running on
the AR100, and that firmware would have a device tree node of its own,
where we could list the clocks needed for the firmware to keep
running, if it ever runs. If the driver has not been compiled in /
loaded, then we don't care either.

But more fundamentally, if we're going to use SCPI, then those clocks
will not be handled by that driver anyway, but by the firmware, right?

So I'm not really sure that we should do it statically this way, and
that we should do it at all.
