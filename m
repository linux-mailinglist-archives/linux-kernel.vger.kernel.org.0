Writing 20 to /dev/cpu_dma_latency (and holding the fd open) removes the excessive latency.
The latency values (for my system) seem to be 0, 1, 10, 59, 80.
I suspect the '10' - C1E (halt + energy saving) is not as bad as expected.

While it may well be that the cpu doesn't enter the C3/C6/C7 states if we
are doing a reasonable amount of work, they are a PITA when you are
trying to look at how a system behaves.

While searching for 'cpu_dma_latency' in Documentation does give some info,
it isn't entirely obvious that is what you need to look for.
Even finding the intel_idle.c code doesn't help much.
A reference from 'man setpriority'  might be a hint....
