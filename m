Yeah, I meant that since the size has (had) to be u16 in the union, it
need not be bigger in kvm_dirty_ring.

I don't think having more than 2^16 entries in the *per-CPU* ring buffer
makes sense; lagging in recording dirty memory by more than 256 MiB per
CPU would mean a large pause later on resetting the ring buffers (your
KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG patches found the sweet spot to be around 1 GiB for
the whole system).

So I liked the union, but if you removed it you might as well align the
producer and consumer indices to 64 bytes so that they are in separate
cache lines.
