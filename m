Is "IIO" being used here the same way that drivers/iio/ is in the
kernel, or is this some other term?  If it is the same, why isn't the
iio developers involved in this?  If it is some other term, please
always define it and perhaps pick a different name :)

What is uncore_iio_N?  A struct device?  Or something else?

Where did "pci_bus" come from in there?  I don't see under /sys/devices/
for my pci bridges.

Why have a subdir here?

Anyway, yes, that would make sense, if userspace can actually do
something with that, can it?

Also, what tears those symlinks down when you remove those pci devices
from the system?  Shouldn't you have an entry in the pci device itself
for this type of thing?  And if so, isn't this really just a "normal"
class type driver you are writing?  That should handle all of the
symlinks and stuff for you automatically, right?

thanks,
