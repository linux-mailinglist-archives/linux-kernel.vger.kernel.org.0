Then please help Rasmus with a suggestion on how best to detect and
safely make use of the feature you implemented.  As is, the patch in
question is using version checks.

So I'm not convinced this GNU C extension solves the problem it's
described to be used for.  I agree that current implementations in
multiple compilers is imprecise, and leads to developer headaches.  I
think `asm inline` will help in cases where vanilla `asm`
overestimates the size of inline assembly, but I also think it will be
just as bad as vanilla `asm` in cases where the size is
underestimated.

I have seen instances where instruction selection fails to select the
appropriate way to branch when inline asm size is misjudged, resulting
in un-encodeable jumps (as in the branch target is too far to be
encoded in the number of bits of a single jump/branch instruction).
And the use of .pushsection/.popsection assembler directives and
__attribute__((section())) attributes complicates the accounting
further, as you can then place code from the inline assembly in a
different section than the function itself (so that inline assembly
doesn't affect the function's size, and the implications on inlining
the function).  That would cause vanilla `asm` to overestimate size.
(I suspect variable length encoded instruction sets also suffer from
misaccounting).

Short of invoking the assembler itself, and then matching the byte
size of generated code section that matches the function's section,
can you accurately describe the size of inline assembly.  .macro and
.rept assembler directives really complicate estimates and can cause
vanilla `asm` to underestimate size.

I agree that current implementations in multiple compilers is
imprecise, and leads to developer headaches.  Rather than give
developers the ability to choose between 2 different heuristics that
are both imprecise, why not make the existing heuristic (ie. vanilla
`asm`) more precise in its measure?
