Hi Greg,

Many thanks for your quick answer, some comments below.

Please correct me if I am wrong, as I'm not an ACPI expert and I probably have
some ACPI leaks and misunderstandings.

What is exporting this driver is the attributes for the non-default Chromebook
specific MLST ACPI method. Hence, I assumed we needed a special driver to expose
these values that can't be done using "default" ACPI sysfs. Note that these
attributes are dynamically created and are different between Chromebooks so need
some parsing.

I didn't find a "standard" way to expose these attributes to userspace, so,
please kindly point me to one if there is one.

Right, my bad. Not all Chromebooks have the same values. I can document the ones
that are created on the devices I have but I'll probably miss some of them. I'll
do some firmware research regarding this.

Will add in the next version.

I thought that the code is more readable doing it attribute by attribute, and
the reason is that apart from remove the bin file I should also free the name,
the data and the specific struct to store the attribute itself as all are
dynamically allocated.

Using attribute groups I should do two steps:

sysfs_remove_group()
list_for_each_entry_safe(attr, tmp_attr, &aag->attribs, list)  {
   kfree(attr->name);
   kfree(attr->data);
   kfree(attr);
}

Ok, will do that in next version.

Ok. The purpose was to not break ChromeOS userspace since is looking for the
attributes inside /sys/devices/platform/chromeos_acpi. Not a good reason, I
know, and I assume we will need to change userspace instead, and convert this to
a ACPI device and driver only, right?

I'll investigate the different places in userspace where this is used and see
how difficult it is to do the changes.

Thanks,
