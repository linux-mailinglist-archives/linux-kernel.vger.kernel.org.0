Should be easy enough to deal with: instead of one large file, use one companion file per source file, perhaps something like filename..xattrs (suggesting double dots to make it less likely to conflict with a "real" file.) No leading dot, as it makes it more likely that archivers will sort them before the file proper.

The advantage there is that the archiver itself could support xattrs and other extended metadata (which has been requested elsewhere); the disadvantage obviously is that that it requires new support in the archiver. However, at least it ought to be simpler since it is still a higher protocol level than the cpio archive itself.

So one way to support such extended metadata would be to set mode to 0 and use the filename to encode the type of metadata. I wonder how existing GNU or BSD cpio (the BSD one is better maintained these days) would deal with reading such a file; it would at least not be a regression if it just read it still, possibly with warnings. It could also be possible to use bits 17:16 in the mode, which are traditionally always zero (mode_t being 16 bits), but I believe are present in most or all of the cpio formats for historical reasons. It might be accepted better by existing implementations to use one of these high bits combined with S_IFREG, I dont know.

I'll happily modify toybox cpio to understand xattrs (compress and decompress),
the android guys do a lot with xattrs already. I tapped out of _this_ discussion
from disgust with the proposed encoding.
