The cs_etm/sinks was only added with the CPU-wide trace support. So, if someone
refers to this document alone and then tries to do something on on older kernel,
which is quite possible for a production device running a stable kernel, {s,}he
might be surprised.

My question is really, does the naming convention matter ? What you see
under the directory is the name. But yes, I am open to add a section to
explain the fact that we changed the naming scheme, if everyone agrees
to it.
