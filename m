It is not a macro, it doesn't spill over the place, and it is for
detecting things that are already fixed strings, much easier to do :-)

That one happened because of the Great Security Scare of 2017/2018, it's
not a good precedent.  And, how it is set is target-specific, it can
depend on CPU model selected, target code generation options, or whatnot.

Maybe GCC should have a has_feature thing, it might fit in well there.
As preprocessor macros, not so much, IMO.
