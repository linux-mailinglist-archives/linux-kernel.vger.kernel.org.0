No!

That is the case.  If we save only supervisor states, the buffer becomes
smaller and has only supervisor states.

I thought Sebastian was saying XSAVES is not optimal.

CET has 16 bytes for ring-3 setting, 24 bytes for ring-0.
Saving supervisor states somewhere else and copying back is not better
either.

We save supervisor states only when xfeatures_mask_supervisor() is not
zero.
