Good question.

Please, remove the last hunk if Sergey is not against it.
I think that the success/error should not depend on the state
of CON_ENABLED flag.

The other two changes might stay in the same patch. We just need
to make the commit message easier to understand. I would write
something like:

<begin>
There are only two callers that use the returned code from
unregister_console():

  + unregister_early_console() in arch/m68k/kernel/early_printk.c
  + kgdb_unregister_nmi_console() in drivers/tty/serial/kgdb_nmi.c

They both expect to get "0" on success and a non-zero value on error.
But the current behavior is confusing and buggy:

  + _braille_unregister_console() returns "1" on success
  + unregister_console() returns "1" on error

Fix and clean up the behavior:

  + Return success when _braille_unregister_console() succeeded.
  + Return a meaningful error code when the console was not
    registered before.
</end>

Best Regards,
Petr
