Xiaoyao's reply suggests that he also understood it like that.

I am not ignoring them, I think there is no doubt that this is the
intended behavior.  I disagree that Sean's patches achieve it, however.

My lazy "solution" only applies to SMT enabled.  When SMT is either not
supported, or disabled as in "nosmt=force", we can virtualize it like
the posted patches have done so far.

Yes, that's a valid alternative.  But if SMT is possible, I think the
only sane possibilities are global disable and SIGBUS.  SIGBUS (or
better, a new KVM_RUN exit code) can be acceptable for debugging guests too.
