Really, I'd like to get rid of platforms doing their own calls. That's
mostly an arm32 issue. Most of what's left are either platforms using
auxdata which was supposed to be a transition thing or ones that set a
parent device (soc_device). The former takes work to finish converting
platforms to DT and I don't know what to do for the latter other than
always or never set a parent device. Also, I know there's an issue on
atmel where we can't remove their of_platform_populate call because it
changes the probe order and breaks their pinctrl and gpio driver (I
started a patch for that...).
