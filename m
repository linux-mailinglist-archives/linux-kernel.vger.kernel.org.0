Put that as a Link: below.

I see two more typos in here and if you had a spellchecker enabled in
your editor where you write the commit message, you'll see them too.
Please use one.

Well, it is not obvious to me. Please be more specific: why would the
kdump kernel do that?

If you mention the actual reason here, that sentence would be clearer:

"When SME is enabled in the first kernel, the kdump kernel must access
the first kernel's memory with the encryption bit set."

Something like that.

I fail to see what that's trying to tell me? You have invalid pointers?

This paragraph belongs under the "---" line below.

Ditto.

This ifdeffery needs to be a function in kernel/kexec_core.c which is
called by reserve_real_mode(), instead.
