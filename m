Getting back to this after realizing I lost SCTLR.HUPCF patch that I
was carrying locally when rebasing.  Here is an example dump (w/ FSR)
of what happens:

The 'CP illegal instruction error's and following gpu fault are the
result of the faulting read from the GPU causing other non-faulting
reads to return zero.


Note that enabling STALL (CFCFG) also avoids this problem.  I suppose
maybe setting CFCFG for implementation==QCOM_SMMUV2 would be a better
idea?
