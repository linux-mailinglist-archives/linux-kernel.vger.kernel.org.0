First of all, thanks for working on this. While from Chromium point of
view there isn't any practical use case for this feature, it could
possibly be valuable for some other platforms.

I still see a problem with the current design. Mem-to-mem decoders are
commonly used in a multi-instance fashion, but media topology is
global. That means that when having two applications on the system
decoding their own videos, one might be stepping on the other by
changing the topology.

I believe that if we want this to be really usable, we would need to
make the media topology per instance, but that's a significant change
to the media subsystem. Maybe we could pursue the other options I
suggested in the previous revision instead, like ordering the formats
returned by enum_fmt by native first and adding format flags that
would tell the userspace that the format can have some performance
and/or power penalty?

Best regards,
Tomasz
