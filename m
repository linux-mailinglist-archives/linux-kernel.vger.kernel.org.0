Changes in v2:
- Add Stephen's Reviewed-By to the first three patches
- Addressed Stephen's comments on fourth patch
- Include changes to connect rpmh domain to cpuidle and genpds

Resource State Coordinator (RSC) is responsible for powering off/lowering
the requirements from CPU subsystem for the associated hardware like buses,
clocks, and regulators when all CPUs and cluster is powered down.

RSC power domain uses last-man activities provided by genpd framework based
on Ulf Hansoon's patch series[3], when the cluster of CPUs enter deepest
idle states. As a part of domain poweroff, RSC can lower resource state
requirements by flushing the cached sleep and wake state votes for various
resources.
