What I said was wrong.

We send a counter (increased when the user consumes the packets) and the
"buf_alloc" (the max memory allowed) to the other peer.
It makes a difference between a local counter (increased when the
packets are sent) and the remote counter to calculate the credit available:

    u32 virtio_transport_get_credit(struct virtio_vsock_sock *vvs, u32 credit)
    {
    	u32 ret;

    	spin_lock_bh(&vvs->tx_lock);
    	ret = vvs->peer_buf_alloc - (vvs->tx_cnt - vvs->peer_fwd_cnt);
    	if (ret > credit)
    		ret = credit;
    	vvs->tx_cnt += ret;
    	spin_unlock_bh(&vvs->tx_lock);

    	return ret;
    }

Maybe I can play with "buf_alloc" to take care of bytes queued but not
used.

Thanks,
Stefano
