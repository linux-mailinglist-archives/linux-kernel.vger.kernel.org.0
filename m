No, it doesn't. I hope you realised that now based on your statement below.

Yes, this may fix the issue. However I would like to know if we need to
support multiple channels/shared memory simultaneously. It is fair
requirement and may need some work which should be fine. I just want to
make sure we don't need anything more from DT or if we need to add more
to DT bindings, we need to ensure it won't break single channel. I will
think about that, but I would like to hear from other users of this SMC
for SCMI.
