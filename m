Ack. We've all been underwater this week and this wasn't addressed, 
sorry about the delay. It's probably wise to revert this commit at this 
point while we look for an alternate solution?

There was an initial proposal submitted on GitHub [1] (patch attached) 
which implemented what Takashi suggested in his comments. This proposal 
was later optimized further, it could be that the optimization was one 
bridge too far.

Could you let us know if this attached patch has any negative effects on 
non-Intel platforms?

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: core: lock client_mutex while removing link components

Removing link components results in topology unloading. So,
acquire the client_mutex before removing components in
snd_soc_unbind_card(). This will prevent lockdep warning
when the dai link is removed.
