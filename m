It was the 'trace' file - ie the text formatted by the kernel.
I've looked at a lot of traces over the last few weeks and not seen it before.
The workload is the same, so I assumed there might be a kernel change.
I've just updated from a 5.4-rc7 kernel to a 5.6-rc7 one.

I've not got a silly number of context switches.
But it seemed to have consistently lost some process names even when they
went idle and then resumed.

I would have been tracing the schedule process wakeup and switch events,
system call entry/exit and irq+softirq.

Ok if nothing has changed I'll stop worrying and work out what I've broken.

Oh, does the 'function_graph' code ignore tail calls?
