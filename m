I mean when messages that are going to be read get lost, there is an
inconsistency between what we want and what are left.

This is all due to an LTP case which passes on mainline kernel but fails
(line 425) on RT kernel.

https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/blob/master/testcases/kernel/logging/kmsg/kmsg01.c#L425

But after comparing how mainling and RT kernel handle the case, I thought it was
better not to return an EPIPE.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rt/linux-rt-devel.git/tree/kernel/printk/printk.c?h=linux-5.2.y-rt#n706

When log_first_seq is 0 in  devkmsg_open.

If this is the case, I'm going to submit a patch for RT kernel.
