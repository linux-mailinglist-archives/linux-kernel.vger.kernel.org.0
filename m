We have problems with the order in which we call the set_rate clk_op.
Sometimes clk providers want us to call from leaf to root but instead we
call from root to leaf because of implementation reasons. Controlling
the order in which clk operations are done is an unsolved problem. But
yes, in the future I'd like to see us introduce the vaporware that is
coordinated clk rates that would allow clk providers to decide what this
order should be, instead of having to do this "root-to-leaf" update.
Doing so would help us with the clk dividers that have some parent
changing rate that causes the downstream device to be overclocked while
we change the parent before the divider.

If there are more assumptions like this about how the CCF is implemented
then we'll have to be extra careful to not disturb the "normal" order of
operations when introducing something that allows clk providers to
modify it.

Also, isn't CLK_SET_RATE_GATE broken in the case that clk_set_rate()
isn't called on that particular clk? I seem to recall that the flag only
matters when it's applied to the "leaf" or entry point into the CCF from
a consumer API. I've wanted to fix that but never gotten around to it.
The whole flag sort of irks me because I don't understand what consumers
are supposed to do when this flag is set on a clk. How do they discover
it? They're supposed to "just know" and turn off the clk first and then
call clk_set_rate()? Why can't the framework do this all in the
clk_set_rate() call?
