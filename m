I own another device (let's refer to it as "black odd"), identical to
the "slow" one (call it "black even"), and used it as well  to do the
tests, especially in the beginning of this story, because I suspected
the problem could be related to a faulty pen drive. At a certain time
I realized that the tests I performed didn't show any difference
between the two flash drives, so since that time I kept using just the
"black even". They were bought together, so of course both of them
probably belong to the same "maybe-bad batch".

But I have another Kingston DataTraveler ("White"), externally
slightly different from the other twos (it's white instead of black,
and labeled G4 instead of G3), though lsusb shows the same IDs:
0951:1666. It had been purchased some months after the other twos
(well, actually, it may be the result of an RMA exchange).

I have just ran one test on this White one, with the new (patched)
kernel, and it took an average of 200seconds (st.dev=46s), which is
not "good", but less "bad" than the real "bad" case of the "black"
ones (>1000 seconds).

I have also tried the "WHITE" one with the old fast kernel, and the
behavior is almost the same as with the new kernel, though a little
bit better (mean=173; st.dev.=11).

Feel free to let me know if I should do other tries,

thanks,
Andrea
