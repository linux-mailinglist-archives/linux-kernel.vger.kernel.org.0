> > +
> > +The driver exposes a misc device called :file:`/dev/mei`.
> > +
> > +An application maintains communication with an Intel ME feature

> > +The number of instances of an Intel ME feature that can be opened
> > at

> > +allow only a single instance.
> > +
> > +The Intel AMT Host Interface (Intel AMTHI) feature supports

> > applications.
> > +
> > +The driver is transparent to data that are passed between firmware
> > +feature and host application.
> > +
> > +Because some of the Intel ME features can change the system
> > +configuration, the driver by default allows only a privileged user
> > to
> > +access it.

> > +Intel AMT OS Health Watchdog
> > +============================
> > +
> > +The Intel AMT Watchdog is an OS Health (Hang/Crash) watchdog.
> > +Whenever the OS hangs or crashes, Intel AMT will send an event to
> > any
> > +subscriber to this event. This mechanism means that IT knows when
> > a
> > +platform crashes even when there is a hard failure on the host.
> > +
> > +The Intel AMT Watchdog is composed of two parts:
> > +        1) Firmware feature - receives the heartbeats
> > +           and sends an event when the heartbeats stop.
> > +        2) Intel MEI iAMT watchdog driver - connects to the
> > watchdog feature,
> > +           configures the watchdog and sends the heartbeats.
> > +
> > +The Intel iAMT watchdog MEI driver uses the kernel watchdog API to
> > +configure the Intel AMT Watchdog and to send heartbeats to it. The
> > +default timeout of the watchdog is 120 seconds.
> > +
> > +If the Intel AMT is not enabled in the firmware then the watchdog
> > +client won't enumerate on the me client bus and watchdog devices
> > won't be

> > -============================
> > -
> > -The Intel AMT Watchdog is an OS Health (Hang/Crash) watchdog.
> > -Whenever the OS hangs or crashes, Intel AMT will send an event -to
> > any
> > subscriber to this event. This mechanism means that -IT knows when
> > a platform
> > crashes even when there is a hard failure on the host.
> > -
> > -The Intel AMT Watchdog is composed of two parts:
> > -	1) Firmware feature - receives the heartbeats
> > -	   and sends an event when the heartbeats stop.
> > -	2) Intel MEI iAMT watchdog driver - connects to the watchdog
> > feature,
> > -	   configures the watchdog and sends the heartbeats.
> > -
> > -The Intel iAMT watchdog MEI driver uses the kernel watchdog API to
> > configure
> > -the Intel AMT Watchdog and to send heartbeats to it. The default
> > timeout of
> > the -watchdog is 120 seconds.
