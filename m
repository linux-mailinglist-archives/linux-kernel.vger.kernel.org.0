That's a bit more involved than what I came up with.

So basically it seems that on arm64, gcc only saves the lr when needed
(leaf functions don't need it). And I can even see that if you have
several paths that don't call other functions, why save the lr?

It does seem that doing the slight change makes the current code more
accurate without need for any heuristics.

Here's my patch again, slightly tweaked and Jiping said it solved the
issue for him.

Are you OK with this change?
