Oh, spiffy!

Curious: do you take into account things like alignment and/or access size
when looking at READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE? Perhaps you could initially prune
naturally aligned accesses for which __native_word() is true?

This one is tricky. What I think we need to avoid is an onslaught of
patches adding READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE without a concrete analysis of the
code being modified. My worry is that Joe Developer is eager to get their
first patch into the kernel, so runs this tool and starts spamming
maintainers with these things to the point that they start ignoring KCSAN
reports altogether because of the time they take up.

I suppose one thing we could do is to require each new READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE
to have a comment describing the racy access, a bit like we do for memory
barriers. Another possibility would be to use atomic_t more widely if
there is genuine concurrency involved.

Start by posting the patches :)
