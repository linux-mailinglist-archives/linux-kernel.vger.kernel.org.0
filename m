If nothing calls enable the cpu clock while it is managed by Linux
(cpufreq), there might something worth fixing. Adding CLK_IS_CRITICAL
will mask an issue that is still not explained.

"at any time": absolutely not.
Disabling unused clocks, is done only once, at during the late_init
stage.

If your clock gets disabled later on, it means it has been turned on and
off by another driver (possibly due to probe deferral)

Yes there are other critical clocks on Amlogic, mostly because the SCP Fw
driver does not claim the clocks it depends on. At least we know why
this flag is set and there should be a comment associated with it.

ATM, the issue reported by Anand (anyone else ?) is not explained.
