Which reminds me...  I recall your asking if the kfree_rcu() patch
might be sensitive to the exact hardware, but I cannot locate that
email right off-hand.  This is an excellent question!  When faced with
floods of kfree_rcu() calls, I would expect some hardware, compiler,
and kernel-configuration sensitivity.  Which is why it will likely be
necessary to do a few more improvements over time -- for but one example,
accumulating callbacks into vectors in order to reduce the number of
kfree()-time cache misses.
