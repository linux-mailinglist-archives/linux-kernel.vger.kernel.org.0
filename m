Looking more closely at iowait boost, it's not actually a generic cpufreq
attribute. Only schedutil and intel_pstate have it. Other governors might
implement something similar but under a different name.

So I'm not sure how easy it'd be to implement a generic toggle for something
that probably should be considered an implementation detail of a governor and
userspace shouldn't care much about.

Of course, the maintainers might have a different opinion. So don't let mine
discourage you from pursuing this further! :-)

It is true the 2 patches are orthogonal, but if you already cap the max
frequencies the background task can use, by ensuring the iowait_boost in
schedutil respects the uclamp restrictions then this should solve your problem
too, no?

The patch below only compile tested.


	background/cpu.uclamp.max = 200 # Cap background tasks max frequencies
