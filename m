Yes, my patch was attempting to expose it for all "cros_ec" devices,
even if the EC didn't support that feature. I was hoping to avoid
polluting other devices like cros_fp and cros_pd, but I think you may
be correct about cros_scp. That's something that will act as the
system EC but is named differently because it can send IPIs as well?
Weird, but ok.

Ok, I'll add this debugfs file to all EC devices.
