I'm not too keen on this approach: elsewhere we just stub out all the
FPSIMD handling logic if !system_supports_fpsimd() -- I think we should
be using this test everywhere rather than relying on TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE.

Rather, I feel that TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE means "if this is a user task
and this task is current() and the system supports FPSIMD at all, this
task's FPSIMD state is not loaded in the cpu".

I think we should ensure that any check on TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is
shadowed by a check on system_supports_fpsimd() somewhere.  This already
exists in many places -- we just need to fill in the missing ones.

fpsimd_save() is a backend function that should only be called if
system_supports_fpsimd(), so that should not need any check internally,
but we should make sure that calls to this function are appropriately
protected with in if (system_supports_fpsimd()).

For other maintenance functions intended for outside callers:

 * fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu()
 * fpsimd_bind_state_to_cpu()
 * fpsimd_flush_task_state()
 * fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state()

the situation is less clear.  Does is make sense to call these at all
if !system_supports_fpsimd()?  I'm not currently sure.  We could at
least drop some WARN_ON() into these to check, after revieweing their
callsites.

Why should we do this stuff on a system that doesn't support FP?

[...]

Not in scope for a stable fix, but:

It would be interesting to try to strip out TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE
entirely and do some benchmarks and irq latency measurements:

TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is just a cached copy of the wrong_task || wrong_cpu
condition defined in fpsimd_thread_switch() --

That means we have to do maintenance on it all over the place to keep
it in sync with the condition it represents -- this has proven to be
a source of complexity and subtle bugs, as well as making the code
fragile to maintain.

The only point of all this is so that there is a thread flag for
do_notify_resume() to check.  Now that do_notify_resume() is C it would
be trivial to check the real condition -- there would be a cost
increase and interrupt latency increase here, but maybe not that much.

This wouldn't solve the whole problem, but it might remove a layer of
complexity.
