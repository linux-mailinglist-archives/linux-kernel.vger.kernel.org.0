I know that the MTD layer has the same kind of unlocking. But that
unlocking is done on a per mtd partition basis. Eg. consider something
like the following

  mtd1 bootloader  (locked)
  mtd2 firmware    (locked)
  mtd3 kernel
  mtd4 environment

Further assume, that the end of mtd2 aligns with one of the possible
locking areas which are supported by the flash chip. Eg. the first 
quarter.

The mtd layer would do two (or four, if "lock" property is set) unlock()
calls, one for mtd1 and one for mtd2.

My point here is, that the mtd partitions doesn't always map to the
locking regions of the SPI flash (at least if the are not merged 
together).

As this change may help my use-case, unlocking is skipped because the
partitions are marked as read only; I fear that the old behaviour will
change. See above.

Mhh. thinking more about it, doesn't the calls also wear out the
non-volatile bits in the NOR flash?

In any case, I'll try your suggestion.
