Just a note that I'm traveling at the moment, and won't be able do much
other than comment on this for a few days.

I *think* this is probably safe.

AIUI, when you use atomic bitops on a flag word like this, you should
use them for all modifications to ensure that your changes don't get
clobbered by another task racing in to do a read/modify/write cycle on
the same word.

I haven't gone over all of the places where fl_flags is changed, but I
don't see any at first glance that do it on a blocked request.

This will break kABI, so backporting this to enterprise distro kernels
won't be trivial. Not a showstopper, but it might be nice to avoid that
if we can.

While it's not quite as efficient, we could just do the FL_DELETING
manipulation under the flc->flc_lock. That's per-inode, so it should be
safe to do it that way.
