Those that do not have a driver *yet*. What if i3cdev is compiled-in
and other I3C drivers are enabled as modules? When the device is
discovered at boot time is will be automatically bound to the i3cdev
driver since no matching drivers are available at that point. But
the end user probably expects this device to be attached to the in
kernel driver.

Well, I3C and I2C/SPI are quite different in this regard. I2C dev
exposes the whole bus, and SPI devs don't have a standard way to
uniquely identify the device connected on the bus (unless it has a
dedicated compatible for DT-based boards). In that case it might make
sense to auto-bind all orphan devs to the default spidev driver, though
I'm not entirely sure it's really necessary since that's probably a
per-board decision, and having a udev rule matching the bus/CS would
make sense too.

That's my point. We're making the default 'on-demand driver loading'
use case more complicated to ease the less common 'userspace driver'
use case.
