I use some third-party application, such as weibo and others, to test
the application launch time. I apply this RT patch, and compare it with
original design. Both RT patch test case and original design test case
are already apply the
patch:https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1129117/

After apply the RT patch, launch time of weibo from 1325.72ms to 1214.88
ms, its launch time decreases 110.84ms(about 8.36%). Other applications
also decrease 7~13%.

At original design test case, RT tasks(surfaceflinger) could preempt
some CFS tasks, if we add all these CFS tasks runnable time, it may have
some impact on app launch time. So even if we already use the load
balance patch and reduce a lot of CFS runnable time, I think choose idle
CPU at RT scheduler could also reduce the some CFS runnable time.
