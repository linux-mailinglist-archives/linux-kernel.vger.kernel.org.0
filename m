This isn't a question of "easiest".  Unregistering child devices in a
release handler is just _wrong_, plain and simple.  That's what gives
rise to the

"sysfs group 'power' not found for kobject 'i2c-0'"

warning in the kernel log.  The group can't be found because it has 
already been removed; it gets destroyed when the parent USB interface 
device is unregistered, because unregistering a device also removes 
from sysfs everything below that device.
