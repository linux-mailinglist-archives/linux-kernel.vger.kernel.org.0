Any set-uid-root app is a hazard.  This wrapper's purpose is to reduce the =
risk inherent in running apps with elevated privs.
It removes all capabilities (CAT_SETUID, CAT_SETPCAP, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, etc=
.) except for the required ones before execve().  It has a list of users al=
lowed run apps (and a per-user whitelist of arguments, and it manages resou=
rces and time used by apps).

The wrapper works great for things like tcpdump -- it is executed with the =
user's uid and just CAP_NET_CAP and CAP_NET_ADMIN set.

Unfortunately, perf is using uid=3D=3D0 and euid=3D=3D0 as a "capability bi=
ts".

In tools/perf/util/evsel.c:
	static bool perf_event_can_profile_kernel(void)
	{
		return geteuid() =3D=3D 0 || perf_event_paranoid() =3D=3D -1;
	}

In tools/perf/util/symbol.c:
	static bool symbol__read_kptr_restrict(void)
	{
	...
		value =3D ((geteuid() !=3D 0) || (getuid() !=3D 0)) ?
				(atoi(line) !=3D 0) :
				(atoi(line) =3D=3D 2);
	...
	}

Unfortunately, this configuration does not work, unless you reset /proc/sys=
/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to a permissive level (see code above). We have=
 perf_event_paranoid set to 2. If it worked, we could had implemented the s=
ame capability-based policy in the wrapper.

I really wish that there were only two concepts that mattered: capability s=
ets and fsuid/fsgid. The proposed patch allows one to switch to such mode -=
- a much simpler mode. Yes, the patch does add a "new feature", but what ma=
tters most for the complexity question is whether this feature is a move in=
 the right direction.  I am leaning that way, but I am not 100% positive --=
 hence this RFC patch.


> What are some other examples of programs that could utilize this scheme?

That's everything, like our wrapper, that needs to allow non-root users to =
run apps (like perf) that use uid/euid as capabilities.  It is a required, =
if the apps could interact with a filesystem (and accessing root-owned file=
s is not a desired effect).  It is a good idea from the security perspectiv=
e even if those apps do not normally interact with a filesystem.

I do not have a clear view about a variety of Linux apps ever written, but =
I suspect that there are many apps that fall into "use uid/euid as capabili=
ties" category.  There are at least two in the kernel's tools directory. Th=
ere is also use of uid/eiud in the kernel itself, and anything that uses th=
is functionality cannot be fixed w/o fixing the kernel. It may be a bit har=
d to find all such uses, but a good start is:

	grep -rE '(uid_eq|uid\(\)).*\b(GLOBAL_ROOT_ID|0)\b'
