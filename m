Why does the SDK anyway use real enclaves when step debugging? I don't
think kernel needs to scale to that. For me it looks more like a bad
architectural choice in the SDK implementation than anything else.

You should design SDK in a way that it doesn't run the code inside real
enclave at first. It is just the sanest development model to use. The
current SDK has an unacceptable requirement that the workstation used to
develop code destined to run inside enclave must possess an appropriate
hardware. I don't think that is acceptable no matter what kind of API
kernel provides to invoke enclaves.

I think "real" debug enclaves are only good for production testing when
you have more or less ready to release/deploy something but still want
to be able to get a memory dump of the enclave on occassion.

With these conclusions I think the current vDSO API is sufficient for
Linux.
