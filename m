The mdp5 support is there.  Some of the dependencies have dragged out.
I'd have to make sense of my development tree as to what is relevant.

It uses the TI SN65 bridge.

I don't think panel is null in my case.  I need to trace a few things
through to be sure.

Taking a quick look at the datasheet for the bridge, I suspect that
operations are occurring in the enable() phase of the bridge, that
need to occur before video data is transmitted.  Based on your
analysis in the commit message, I suspect these operations need to be
moved to pre_enable().

I'm hoping to gather more data this weekend, which will hopefully
identify what we need to do to move this forward without causing
regressions.
