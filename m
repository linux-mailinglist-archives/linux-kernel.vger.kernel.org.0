Boris,

Thanks for the review. All comments accepted and changes made, except as
listed below.  Also will fix up some other checkpatch fluff.

I don't have a good abbreviation.  It would become the joint 2nd longest
flag name ... top ten lengths look like this on my test machine. So while
long, not unprecedented.

18 tsc_deadline_timer
17 split_lock_detect

Blame PeterZ for that. For now I'd like to add the duplicate inline function
and then clean up by putting it into some header file (and maybe hunting down
other places where it could be used).

Also some PeterZ code. As the comment implies we really shouldn't be able
to get here. This whole function should only be called on CPU models that
support the MSR ... but PeterZ is defending against the situation that sometimes
there are special SKUs with the same model number (since we may be here because
of an x86_match_cpu() hit, rather than the architectural enumeration check).

Thomas explained how to fix it so we only call the function if TIF_SLD
is set in either the previous or next process (but not both). So the
overhead is just extra XOR/AND in the caller.
