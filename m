You have indicated this previously but no call for a stand alone
reproducer was successful. It is really hard to optimize for such a
specialized workload without anything to play with. Btw. this is exactly
a case where I would expect numa balancing to converge to the optimal
placement. And if numabalancing is not an option than an explicit
mempolicy (e.g. the one suggested here) would be a good fit.

I will defer the compaction related stuff to Vlastimil and Mel who are
much more familiar with the current code.

Doesn't this lead to the same THP low success rate we have seen with one
of the previous patches though?

Let me remind you of the previous semantic I was proposing
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181206091405.GD1286@dhcp22.suse.cz and that
didn't get shot down. Linus had some follow up ideas on how exactly
the fallback order should look like and that is fine. We should just
measure differences between local node cheep base page vs. remote THP on
_real_ workloads. Any microbenchmark which just measures a latency is
inherently misleading.

And really, fundamental problem here is that MADV_HUGEPAGE has gained 
a NUMA semantic without a due scrutiny leading to a broken interface
with side effects that are simply making the interface unusable for a
large part of usecases that the madvise was originaly designed for.
Until we find an agreement on this point we will be looping in a dead
end discussion, I am afraid.
