I think that this problem is orthogonal to a flush on the user path. For =
example

   - Write to LBA0 + completion to host
   - [=E2=80=A6]
   - GC LBA0
   - Write to LBA0 + completion to host
   - fsync() + completion
   - Power Failure

When we power up and do recovery in the current implementation, you
might get the old LBA0 mapped correctly in the L2P table.

If we enforce ID ordering for GC lines this problem goes away as we can
continue ordering lines based on ID and then recovering sequentially.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Javier
