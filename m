No, this scenario is not affected by this patch. It would always lead to
a deadlock.

This scenario should get better handled by this patch. The difference
will be when smp_send_stop() is not able to stop all CPUs:

  + Before:
      + printk_safe_flush_on_panic() will keep logbuf_lock locked
	and do nothing.

      + kmsg_dump(), console_unblank(), or console_flush_on_panic()
	will deadlock when they try to get logbuf_lock(). They will
	not be able to process any single line.

  + After:
      + printk_bust_lock_safe() will keep logbuf_lock locked

      + All functions using logbuf_lock will not get called.
	We will not see the messages (as previously) but the
	system will not deadlock.


But there is one more scenario 3:

  - we have CPUB which loops or is deadlocked in IRQ context

  - we have CPUA which panic()-s the system, but can't bring CPUB down,
    so logbuf_lock might be takes and release from time to time
    by CPUB

Hmm, this scenario might be handled a bit _worse_ by this patch:

  + Before:
      + printk_safe_flush_on_panic() will not touch logbuf_lock
	The messages will get flushed according to the state of
	logbuf_lock at the moment when it is being checked.

      + kmsg_dump(), console_unblank(), or console_flush_on_panic()
	will be able to do their job.

  + After:
      +  printk_safe_flush_on_panic(), kmsg_dump(), console_unblank(),
	 and console_flush_on_panic() could finish the job. But they
	 will get called _only_ when logbuf_lock is released at
	 the moment when it is being checked by printk_bust_lock_safe().


Resume:

From my POV, the 3rd scenario is the most likely one. Therefore this
patch would make more bad than good.

It might be possible to somehow detect if lockbuf_lock is released
from time the time on the non-stopped CPU. But it would be hairy.
IMHO, it is not worth it.

Thanks a lot for helping me to sort the ideas. I suggest to forget
this patch and work on lockless ringbuffer.

Petr
