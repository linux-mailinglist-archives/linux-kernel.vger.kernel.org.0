Easily done, but I need to find a centralized place to say it, or
I'd be repeating myself a *lot* in the series.

That said, thanks for prompting me to quantify the cost ratio.
I knew it, but never actually wrote it down.

No.  Backtracking is an issue if the keys must remain secret *after*
they are wiped from kernel memory.  This applies to session
*encryption* keys (assuming the plaintext should remain secret
after the session is over), and to any long-lived keys which are
stored encrypted or otherwise inaccessible (e.g. in dedicated
hardware).  The latter includes most asymmetric private keys.

Since the pointer authentication keys are authentication keys,
and valueless to an attacker once the kernel is done using them,
there is no need for backtracking protetion.

Basically, do you need to wipe the key (with memzero_explicit) when
you are done with it?  If that is important, you also want to
know that the key cannot be reconstructed from the CRNG state.

A modified patch will follow.  Thanks for your patience.
