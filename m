That's argument against the rfc patches 3+4s, no? But not for including
the reverts of reverts of reverts (patches 1+2).

I doubt this will be finished and tested with reasonable confidence even
for the 5.4 merge window.

There might be other unexpected consequences (even if hugetlb wasn't
such an issue as I suspected, in the end).

It's been said before, but such sensitive code generally relies on
mempolicies or node reclaim mode, not THP __GFP_THISNODE implementation
details. Or if you know there's enough free memory and just needs to be
compacted, you could do it once via sysfs before starting up your workload.

I think it's rather removing the problematic implicit mempolicy of
__GFP_THISNODE.

Clearly we disagree here which is the highly specialized usecase that
might get slower remote memory access, and which is more common workload
that will suffer from swap storms. No point arguing it further, but
several distros made the choice by carrying Andrea's patches already.

I might have missed something, but you were asked for a reproducer of
your use case so others can develop patches with it in mind? Mel did
provide a simple example that shows the swap storms very easily.
