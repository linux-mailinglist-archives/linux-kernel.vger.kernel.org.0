I'm not quite sure what you mean here. The configuration only applies
to the current PHY mode. So the phy consumer will have changed the
mode, and the PHY will have accepted it.

That change is also doable from the framework.

Then, which part of the union is being used is easy to figure out for
both parties, since they agree on it already.

Except that this effectively becomes a black box that the framework
has no control and / or knowledge about.

Which means that it cannot do any kind of checks on it anymore, and
again, that the consumer and driver need to have prior knowledge of
what is being passed, without any way to check whether it's actually
what needs to be passed.

To some extent, the union also allows that, but it's just less
explicit and in general worse, to just pass void* here.
