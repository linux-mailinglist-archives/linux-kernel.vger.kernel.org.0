Good point - but at least according to the GCC 9.2.1 documentation, 
-fshort-enums is a non-default code generation option:

   Options for Code Generation Conventions

       These machine-independent options control the interface 
       conventions used in code generation.

       Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative 
       form of -ffoo is -fno-foo.  In the table below, only one of the 
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       forms is listed---the one that is not the default.  You can figure 
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       out the other form by either removing no- or adding it.

   [...]

       -fshort-enums

           Allocate to an "enum" type only as many bytes as it needs for 
           the declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the 
           "enum" type is equivalent to the smallest integer type that 
           has enough room.

           Warning: the -fshort-enums switch causes GCC to generate code 
           that is not binary compatible with code generated without that 
           switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary 
           interface.

Unless this option is used AFAIK GCC will treat enums as "int" if at 
least one enumeration constant is negative, it's "unsigned int" 
otherwise.

The only current use reference to the non-standard -fshort-enums option 
within the kernel source is the Hexagon arch, which (seemingly 
unnecessarily) disables the option:

  arch/hexagon/Makefile:KBUILD_CFLAGS += -fno-short-enums

That flag came with the original Hexagon commits, 8 years ago:

  e95bf452a9e22   (Richard Kuo    2011-10-31 18:55:58 -0500       10)# Do not use single-byte enums; these will overflow.
  e95bf452a9e22   (Richard Kuo    2011-10-31 18:55:58 -0500       11)KBUILD_CFLAGS += -fno-short-enums

Maybe they had a GCC build where it was on by default? Or GCC changed 
this option sometime in the past? Or it's simply an unnecessary but 
harmless code generation flag out of paranoia?

Out of curiosity I searched all the historic trees, none ever made use of 
the -f*short-enums option, so I don't think this is a GCC option we ever 
actively utilized or ran into.

Yeah, the GCC documentation specifically warns that it breaks the ABI: 
the size of structs using enums will generally change from 4 bytes to 1 
or 2 bytes, and function call signatures will change incompatibly as 
well.

BTW., -fshort-enum looks like a bad code generation option to me, on x86 
at least, because it will also use 16-bit width, which is generally a bad 
idea on x86. If it limited itself to u8 and 32-bit types it could even be 
useful.

Also, I wouldn't be surprised if the kernel ABI broke if we attempted to 
use -short-enum, I bet there's a lot of accidental reliance on 
enum=int/uint.

That's true. Will check whether we can do something about improving the 
affected uclamp data structures.
