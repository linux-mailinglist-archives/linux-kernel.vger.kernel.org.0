Yes it was a problem with ION also, having individual files per heap
does help with some permissions, but my issue is what if I don't want my
CMA exported at all, cma_for_each_area() just grabs them all anyway.

This is definitely the way to go, it's the implementation of how we get
the CMAs to export in the first place that is a bit odd.

When in staging ION had to reach into the CMA framework as the other
direction would not be allowed, so cma_for_each_area() was added. If
DMA-BUF heaps is not in staging then we can do the opposite, and have
the CMA framework register heaps itself using our framework. That way
the CMA system could decide what areas to export or not (maybe based on
a DT property or similar).

The end result is the same so we can make this change later (it has to
come after DMA-BUF heaps is in anyway).
