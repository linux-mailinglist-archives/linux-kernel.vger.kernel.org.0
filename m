 SCSI subsystem documentation
 ============================
+
 The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) maintains a document describing
 the SCSI subsystem in the Linux kernel (lk) 2.4 series. See:
 http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SCSI-2.4-HOWTO . The LDP has single
 and multiple page HTML renderings as well as postscript and pdf.
 It can also be found at:

 Notes on using modules in the SCSI subsystem

+The scsi support in the linux kernel can be modularized in a number of
 different ways depending upon the needs of the end user.  To understand
 your options, we should first define a few terms.

+The scsi-core (also known as the "mid level") contains the core of scsi
 support.  Without it you can do nothing with any of the other scsi drivers.
 The scsi core support can be a module (scsi_mod.o), or it can be built into
-the kernel. If the core is a module, it must be the first scsi module 
-loaded, and if you unload the modules, it will have to be the last one

+loaded, and if you unload the modules, it will have to be the last one
 unloaded.  In practice the modprobe and rmmod commands (and "autoclean")
 will enforce the correct ordering of loading and unloading modules in
 the SCSI subsystem.

+The individual upper and lower level drivers can be loaded in any order
 once the scsi core is present in the kernel (either compiled in or loaded
 as a module).  The disk driver (sd_mod.o), cdrom driver (sr_mod.o),

 and then unload it once you have no further need for the driver (and release
 the associated memory).
 
 The lower level drivers are the ones that support the individual cards that
 are supported for the hardware platform that you are running under. Those
 individual cards are often called Host Bus Adapters (HBAs). For example the
-aic7xxx.o driver is used to control all recent SCSI controller cards from 
-Adaptec. Almost all lower level drivers can be built either as modules or
