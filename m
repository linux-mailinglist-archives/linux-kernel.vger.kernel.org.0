I've fixed this up:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/commit/c8d1cc20df5ca5d9ea437054720fa3cfdfa1f578

But what would be even better is some kind of canned configs/settings
for testing systems so that I enable it once and then such changes
magically auto-happen for me.
Imposing work on N testing systems maintainers is not good.
And there really is no good point in the current kernel dev process
for this. Announcing unmerged changes is too early (as this patch
showed). And once it's in linux-next it's already too late..
And I don't want to be inventing a new unique kernel configuration for
testing. I don't think it's the right way to approach this. Whatever
is "the testing configuration", whatever kernel developers want to see
in task hang reports, I just want the system to provide that.
