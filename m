Ah, I had not checked how many CMD13 for random small writes before.
And I did a quick testing today, I found only 1 CMD13 gets sent for
random writes on my platform.

Right. I think so.

Yes, agree wtih you.

Yes, but my SD card works at high speed mode, and shows a low speed in
4k block size.
[    2.941965] mmc0: new high speed SDHC card at address b368
[    2.948325] mmcblk0: mmc0:b368 SD08G 7.42 GiB
[    2.956554]  mmcblk0: p1

And I did not see any obvious improvement or recession for my SD card
in 4k block size from below data, I think the most of the time is
spent in hardware. (But when I enabled the packed request based on
hsq, I can see some obvious improvement.)
Without hsq:
read: bw=4347KiB/s
randread: bw=3040KiB/s
write: bw=1361KiB/s
randwrite: bw=692KiB/s

With hsq:
read: bw=4246KiB/s
randread: bw=29950KiB/s
write: bw=1417KiB/s
randwrite: bw=697KiB/s
