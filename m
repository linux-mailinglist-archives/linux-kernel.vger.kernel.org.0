This updates sysctl/kernel.rst to use ReStructured Text more fully:
* the list of files is now the table of contents (old entries with no
  corresponding sections are added as empty sections for now);
* code references and commands are formatted as code, except for
  function names which end up linked to the appropriate documentation;
* links are used to point to other documentation and other sections;
* tables are used to make lists of values more readable (as already
  done for some sections);
* in heavily-reworked paragraphs, sentences are wrapped individually,
  to make future diffs easier to read.

The first mention of the kernel version is dropped. The second
mention, saying that the document is accurate for 2.2, is preserved
for now; I will update that once the document really is accurate for a
current kernel release.

-core_pipe_limit:
-================
+core_pipe_limit
+===============
 
-This sysctl is only applicable when core_pattern is configured to pipe
-core files to a user space helper (when the first character of
-core_pattern is a '|', see above).  When collecting cores via a pipe
-to an application, it is occasionally useful for the collecting
-application to gather data about the crashing process from its
-/proc/pid directory.  In order to do this safely, the kernel must wait
-for the collecting process to exit, so as not to remove the crashing
-processes proc files prematurely.  This in turn creates the
-possibility that a misbehaving userspace collecting process can block
-the reaping of a crashed process simply by never exiting.  This sysctl
-defends against that.  It defines how many concurrent crashing
-processes may be piped to user space applications in parallel.  If
-this value is exceeded, then those crashing processes above that value
-are noted via the kernel log and their cores are skipped.  0 is a
-special value, indicating that unlimited processes may be captured in
-parallel, but that no waiting will take place (i.e. the collecting
-process is not guaranteed access to /proc/<crashing pid>/).  This
-value defaults to 0.
