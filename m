That's the pointer to what?  The device that the bus is "attached to"
(i.e. parent, like a platform device or a pci device)?

Why isn't this a "real" device in itself?

I thought I asked that a long time ago when first reviewing these
patches...

The core creates a platform device, don't assume you can "take it over"
:)

That platform device lives on the platform bus, you need a "master"
device that lives on your soundbus bus.

Again, look at how USB does this.  Or better yet, greybus, as that code
is a lot smaller and simpler.

Gotta love the lack of reference counting :(

It sounds like you need a device on your bus that represents the master,
as you have attributes associated with it, and other things.  You can't
put attributes on a random pci or platform device, as you do not "own"
that device.

does that help?
