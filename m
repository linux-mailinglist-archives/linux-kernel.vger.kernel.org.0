My apologies for the delay.

We boot the kernel directly from the Foundation's bootloader without
U-Boot as intermediary, and we use the downstream DT and kernel
(with RT & custom patches).

As far as I could see, the 8250_bcm2835aux UART wasn't even found
when the kernel searched for available earlycons.  The compatible
string in the DT does match the one in Matthias' patch.

I notice that Greg has already applied the patch to tty/next.
I'm currently stretched a little thin but I'll debug this further
once the dust has settled here.

Thanks,

Lukas
