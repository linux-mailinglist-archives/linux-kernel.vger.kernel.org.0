Thank you for your sincere advice, and I have some questions about it.
As you know, the core reason of this ACPI NVS problem is that a busy
bit is set to the ACPI NVS area. So, devm_ioremap_resource() function
fails because of it.

If we want to call devm_ioremap_resource() for this case, we maybe
need to rearrange the existing memory layout from the child
relationship to the sibling relationship below. We also need to get
back when tpm_crb unloads.
[ ACPI NVS (parent) [ TPM CMD buffer (child of NVS) ] [ TPM RSP buffer
(child of NVS) ] ]   <--->   [ ACPI NVS head ] [ CMD buffer ] [ NVS
middle ] [ RSP buffer ] [ NVS tails ]

Our concern is a race condition between NVS driver and TPM CRB driver.
In my view, we could solve this problem if we only make and call the
functions you said, requesting and releasing a region from NVS driver.
NVS driver doesn't rely on iomem layout, and it relies on internal
nvs_list data.

Therefore, I added some details to your guide. How about this sequence?
1) When tpm_crb driver loads, the driver checks if command/response
buffers are in ACPI NVS area. If so, it requests (or removes) the
buffer regions from NVS driver's nvs_list (with
suspend_nvs_unregister() function I will add to the nvs.c driver).

2) If command/response buffers are in ACPI NVS area, tpm_crb driver
calls devm_ioremap() instead of devm_ioremap_resource() like this
patch.

3) When tpm_crb driver unloads, the driver releases (or adds) the
buffer regions to NVS driver's nvs_list (with existing
suspend_nvs_register() function in the nvs.c driver).

I think the sequence could solve the problem we concerned.
What do you think about the sequence?
