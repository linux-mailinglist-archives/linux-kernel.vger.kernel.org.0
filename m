I have a somewhat horrible suggestion.

Would it make sense to refactor this so that it works for user *and*
kernel tables?  In particular, if we flush a *kernel* mapping (vfree,
vunmap, set_memory_ro, etc), we shouldn't need to send an IPI to a
task that is running user code to flush most kernel mappings or even
to free kernel pagetables.  The same trick could be done if we treat
idle like user mode for this purpose.

In code, this could mostly consist of changing all the "user" data
structures involved to something like struct deferred_flush_info and
having one for user and one for kernel.

I think this is horrible because it will enable certain workloads to
work considerably faster with PTI on than with PTI off, and that would
be a barely excusable moral failing. :-p

For what it's worth, other than register clobber issues, the whole
"switch CR3 for PTI" logic ought to be doable in C.  I don't know a
priori whether that would end up being an improvement.
