Oh. I see what you mean. Would it be Ok with you to have that be a follow up
patch?  I am not getting rid (yet) of the special casing in rcu_do_batch in
this patch, but can do that in another patch.

For now I am just doing something like the following in kfree_call_rcu(). I
was almost about to hit send on the v1 and I have been testing this a lot so
I'll post it anyway; and we can discuss more about this point on that.

+void kfree_call_rcu(struct rcu_head *head, rcu_callback_t func)
+{
+       unsigned long flags;
+       struct kfree_rcu_cpu *krcp;
+       bool monitor_todo;
+
+       /* kfree_call_rcu() batching requires timers to be up. If the scheduler
+        * is not yet up, just skip batching and do non-batched kfree_call_rcu().
+        */
+       if (rcu_scheduler_active != RCU_SCHEDULER_RUNNING)
+               return kfree_call_rcu_nobatch(head, func);
+

thanks,
