Quick note regarding C2x: fallthrough didn't make it yet into the
draft (other attributes already did), but it may still be added.

Hmm... Not sure what this refers to, but note that Clang will likely
get support in the next release (they are working on it at the
moment). As far as I understand, we do not yet establish a minimum
version for Clang since they still solving several issues, no?

If the above is correct (i.e. if we do not care about a specific
version of Clang just yet), and since gcc got support for the warning
at the same time as the attribute (7.1), I think we don't need to do
special handing for the warning; but if someone knows about a case
where we do have an issue with it either with GCC or Clang, please let
me know.

I think the primary concern has always been the tooling (e.g. Coverity
was mentioned in October and also this time, and well as some
IDEs/text editors), not the compilers themselves.

Cheers,
Miguel
