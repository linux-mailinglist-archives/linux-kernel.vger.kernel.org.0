I've seen the claims that one would have to degrade one's LSM policy but
I don't think that is true.

With just UNIX permissions you have probably have to restrict the access
to /dev/sgx/enclave to control who can build enclaves. The processes who
do not have this privilege can mmap() the enclave once they get the file
descriptor through forking or SCM_RIGHTS.

After SGX_IOC_ENCLAVE_INIT, the memory layout is sealed and the client
process can only use the enclave.

Further, we have /dev/sgx/provision to restrict, which enclaves can
attest themselves to a remote party.

*If anything*, I would rather investigate possibility to use keyring for
enclave signer's public keys or perhaps having extended attribute for
the signer (SHA256) in the enclave file that could be compared during
the EINIT.

I think either can be considered post-upstreaming.
