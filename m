admittedly I'm trying to solve two different problems here.. we also
have the problem of knowing which panel is installed for the "pure DT"
case.. where /chosen is (IMO) the right thing (alternatives involve a
shim that knows far too much about the device)..

I guess for ACPI boot case, we do anyways want some sort of
configuration table.  I suppose the drm code could look for both
/chosen/panel-id and configuration table and use either.  Although it
would be nice if somehow the config table info ended up in /chosen
when we are not using ACPI, since then at least code paths are more
similar to how we want future android devices to solve this without a
pile of downstream hacks..
