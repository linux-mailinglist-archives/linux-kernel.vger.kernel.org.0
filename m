LPC uses the same software abstraction as the old ISA bus, providing
port (inb/outb) and mmio (readl/writel) style register access as well as
interrupts and a crude form of DMA access.

Whether regmap or something else works depends on which of these
communication options the CPLD uses.

I think this is the most important question. If the same SoC is used
in systems that connect something else on the same LPC bus, then
making it look like a normal ISA/LPC bus to Linux is probably best,
but if the CPLD and SoC are only ever used in this one combination,
there is nothing wrong with pretending that the LPC MMIO interface
on this chip part of the driver for the CPLD.

i2c is a simple bus that allows multiple devices to share a bus
and perform read/write operations on numbered registers. If the device
attached to the LPC bus fits into that, it might be even easier than
regmap.
