I guess you'll also need one on the following field to guarantee that
cmd_buf is covering the whole cache line. TBH, I really prefer the
option of allocating ->cmd_buf.

Not entirely sure why you think this is important to avoid that
test (looks like a micro-optimization to me), but if you really want to
have a non-const buffer, just use the one pointed by op->data.buf.in
(buf is a union so both in and out point to the same thing). Note that
we'd need a comment explaining why this is safe to do that, because
bypassing constness constraints is usually a bad thing.

Do you mean that callers of spi_nor_spimem_xfer_data() should put data
into/read from ->cmd_buf and let spi_nor_spimem_xfer_data() assign
op->data.buf.{in,out} to ->cmd_buf?
