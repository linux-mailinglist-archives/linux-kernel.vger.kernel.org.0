I'm talking about existing simple DT bindings that says what
clocks/interconnects/regulators a device needs. Not sure what you mean
by "it should not be in DT".

Right, and this patch series has nothing to do with describing complex
internals of a device.

What I proposed earlier was using depends-on for all devices. And I'm
glad you rejected it because I like my current set of patches better
than the earlier one. The question here is whether we can allow this
for the rare occasions where there is a cycle. Frank, Greg and I think
it was a reasonable compromise when we talked about it in person.

Sure, but how often are we even going to encounter these?

Even if it's a "doesnt-depend-on" you'll still have that confusion of
whether the new dependency should be added to that blacklist.

This is 100% true/possible on SDM845. They are needed for some
consumers to write to registers. And both the consumer and the
interconnect provider can be loaded as modules. In fact, some paths in
the provider is left on from boot so that the CPU and other devices
can reach memory. You asked for examples of where else there could be
cycles, I gave you one.

I gave you another example above and you are just dismissing it saying
it probably can't be a module, etc. Not sure what more I can tell.

Any property could be misused. We can't control downstream stuff or
other projects.

Sorry, I'm not going to sign up to make dtc changes to be able to add
DT bindings.
