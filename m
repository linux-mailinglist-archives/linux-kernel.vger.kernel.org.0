There were some proposals in the past. IMHO, the most comprehensive
discussion can be found at
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.DEB.2.20.1711131023170.1851@nanos/

The main requirement is:

   + The main timestamp must have the same semantic on all systems

   + User space parses the timestamp. We must not break the format
     and semantic.

  + printk() need to get the timestamp a lockless way


Now, different people wanted different clocks in the past. Which
brings several problems:

   + configuration
   + storing
   + output format so that people/tools know what they read

There is a huge risk that it will get over engineered. Also
there is a risk that some userspace tools might parse it
and we would need to maintain compatibility forever.

IMHO, the most acceptable idea was to print a line with "all"
possible clocks every now and then. It can be done regularly
(once a hour/day) or on event (resume).

These are hints and pointers. Feel free to send patches so
that we could discuss them.

Best Regards,
Petr
