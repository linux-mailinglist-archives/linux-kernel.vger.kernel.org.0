Even with the new printk() Petr proposed. There is no guarantee it will fix it
properly. It looks like just reduce the chance of this kind of deadlocks as it
may or may not call wake_up_klogd() in vprintk_emit() depends on timing.

zone->lock
printk_deferred()
  vprintk_emit()
    wake_up_klogd()
      wake_up_klogd_work_func()
        console_unlock()

which essentially went into the same path,

zone_lock -> console_owner_lock

What else options it has here?

As I mentioned in the changelog that almost nobody call printk() with zone->lock 
held except in memory offline.

"The problem is probably there forever, but neither many developers will
run memory offline with the lockdep enabled nor admins in the field are
lucky enough yet to hit a perfect timing which required to trigger a
real deadlock. In addition, there aren't many places that call printk()
while zone->lock was held."
