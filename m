Yes!
Looks great. More comments below.

This probably needs a longer comment :)

reading asm helps.

It seems to me that it's a bit of overkill to add new config knob
for every ftrace feature.
HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_DIRECT_CALLS (that arch defined) would
be enough to check and return error in register_ftrace_direct()
right?

I don't quite follow why this is needed.
I thought alloc_and_copy_ftrace_hash() can already handle it.
If that is just unrelated cleanup then sure. Looks good.

With FL_DIRECT the CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_IPMODIFY_ONLY won't be needed, right ?
At least not for bpf use case.
Do you see livepatching using it or switching to FL_DIRECT too?

That's probably racy, no?
ftrace_get_addr_new() is not holding direct_mutex that
protects direct_functions.

Having single direct_ops is nice.

I've started playing with this function as well to
implement 2nd nop approach I mentioned earlier.
I'm going to abandon it, since your approach is better.
It allows not only bpf, but anyone else to register direct.

I have one more question/request.
Looks like ftrace can be turned off with sysctl.
Which means that a person or a script can accidently turn it off
and all existing kprobe+bpf stuff that is ftrace based will
be silently switched off.
User services will be impacted and will make people unhappy.
I'm not sure how to solve the existing situation,
but for FL_DIRECT can you add a check that if particular
nop is modified to do direct call then the only interface to
turn it off is to call unregister_ftrace_direct().
There should no side channel to kill it.
ftrace_disable and ftrace_kill make me nervous too.
Fast forward a year and imagine few host critical bpf progs
are running in production and relying on FL_DIRECT.
Now somebody decided to test new ftrace feature and
it hit one of FTRACE_WARN_ON().
That will shutdown the whole ftrace and bpf progs
will stop executing. I'd like to avoid that.
May be I misread the code?
