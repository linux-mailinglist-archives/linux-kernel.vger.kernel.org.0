I like the rather specific example in there. How about we add that after
this section like so:

It was recently discovered that the linux version of waitid is not a
superset of the other wait functions because it does not include
support for waiting for the current process group. This has two
downsides:
1. An extra system call is needed to get the current process group.
2. After the current process group is received and before it is passed
   to waitid a signal could arrive causing the current process group to change.

Such inherent race-conditions as mentioned in 2. make it impossible for
userspace to emulate this functionaly and thus violate the async-signal
safety requirements for waitpid.
