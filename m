This can be wrapped in kconfig and disabled by default.

Christoph's sugggestion goes along the lines with addressing some of
this, yet 2 years havegone by and no one is working on it and its hugely
intrusive. I'd welcome the patches.

There is a difference between getting kernel sources for your current
running kernel Vs getting kernel sources from say Linus' tree or the
stable tree, or whatever subsystem you work on. I'm saying that with
a module attribute being present you would *not* have to get the kernel
sources for the current kernel you are running.

One is compiling a custom kernel.

Actually no, there is huge variance on the qemu level and that problem
is not solved by the above.

Two: build time, and backports.

This is why we are discussing this on this thread.

Since we have 'make localmodconfig' already upstream, and since this
would help both users of that and backports I'd argue it makes sense
upstream. Otherwise I find it that having upstream 'make localmodconfig'
but not wanting to improve that problem space rather odd.

I agree that the problem space you are dealing with should be made

A solution upstream would be better ;)

Yes, but that is a separate problem. The way 'make localmodconfig'
addresses this is by keeping as modules things which are already
modules. And keeping things it found as =y as buit-in in your kernel as
well.
