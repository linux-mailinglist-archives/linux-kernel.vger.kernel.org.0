Chocolate Jollis 38 at gmail.com:
We all die and go to Sheol eventually.
(Except, perhaps, Prophets, here and there)
(RMS is our Software Prophet)

If you think I am "subhuman", judge me on my merits: this is my current 
free software project: libregamewiki.org/Chaos_Esque_Anthology . I 
brought it from 18 weapons to over 200, from 3 vehicles to 30, from 0 
spells to over 50, added city generation, built the building models 
(which include interiors), built the level-of-detail models for such 
things, added RTS style building, and mine-craft-style block building, 
added furnishings, and made 50 levels myself. (And of, course, over 100 
other models needed, and music, and 2 texturesets I made). All of it is 
free software and free media (GPL2, GPL3, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, etc)

I absolutely support RMS' past "pro-paedo" statements, so do many of us 
men in the programming and hacker communities. I want RMS to know that, 
instead of having input only from what are called "normies" today. None 
of his statements were wrong, but you guys pressured him and pushed him 
and got him to recant.

And then you attacked him anyway and got him thrown out of his home of 
40 years. Because you're you. That's what "Your kind" does. Just like my 
"subhuman" kind writes free software for decades, and supports 
immigration to turn your terrible societies into a society where men can 
be happy.
