I think we are stretching a bit more here when there is no any real harm.
Right now it works well for both RPM and !RPM case and if we really need to
fix something in future we can fix. Since my initial inclination was keepin=
g
the code as it is and Jon also has similar thoughts, I would retain this=20
code.
Sorry Dmitry, we can fix if something comes up and many other drivers would
need this at that time.
