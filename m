That's the first option I presented, above.  Since a for() loop
tests before each iteration, if the counter is strictly modulo
ngroups, there's no way to execute the loop body more than ngroups-1
times.

That's why I changed to do{}while(), which has a minimum of 1 (it can't
handle ngroups == 0), but can mimic the current loop's execution
perfectly (no initial +1 offset).
