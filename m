Just startup a VM with two nodes, then run case-lru-file-readtwice or 
case-lru-file-readonce in vm-scalability in root memcg or with memcg 
disabled.  Then get the average throughput (dd result) from the test. 
Our test bench uses the script from lkp, but I just ran it manually. 
Single node VM should be more obvious showed in my test.
