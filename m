But the issue is that you can't "force" this from the kernel side at
all.  Trying to catch this at open() time only catches the obvious
processes.

As I said, how do you check for:
	fd = open(...);
	fd_new = dup(fd);

	write(fd, ...);
	write(fd_new, ...);

or, pass the fd across a socket?  Or other fun ways of sending file
descriptors around a system.

You have to trust userspace here, sorry.  If someone wants to do
multiple accesses, they can, but again, they deserve the pieces when
things fall apart.

What drivers show the number of open file descriptors?  Time to go
delete them as well :)
