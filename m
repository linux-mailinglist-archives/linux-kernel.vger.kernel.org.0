If I really cared, I'd cry. This HW is useless.

1) you can't suppress a level interrupt that cannot be disabled. It 
will
fire back at you.
2) given that you have to demux things using MMIO accesses, performance
is the least of anybody's worry.

You are missing the point of the pseudo-NMI infrastructure. To be 
useful,
it *must* be the root interrupt controller. Otherwise, you cannot 
distinguish
it from the other interrupts it is muxed with. Your 'NMI' is absolutely
unusable, and whoever designed this HW should be actively prevented
from ever designing another interrupt controller again.

I don't plan to review any of this until after the merge window, so 
please
take as long as you want.
