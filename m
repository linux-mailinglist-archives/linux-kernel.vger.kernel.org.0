Where did they say that?  Any reason their developers are not on this

Well, they try to, it doesn't always work :(

Oh we all know why this is a mess.  But they have been saying for
_years_ they would clean up this mess.  So push back, I'm not going to
take another 200k lines for a simple wifi driver, again.

Along those lines, we should probably just delete the other old realtek
drivers that don't seem to be going anywhere from staging as well,
because those are just confusing people.

That's not what I asked.

I want to know why they can't just add support for their new devices to
one of the many existing realtek drivers we already have.  That is the
simpler way, and the correct way to do this.  We don't do this by adding
200k lines, again.

Device "goes well" please.  And when in 2020?  And why 2020?  Why not
2022?  2024?

So who is going to be responsible for "fixing the driver" for all new
kernel api updates?  I'm tired of seeing new developers get lost in the
maze of yet-another realtek wifi driver.  We've been putting up with
this crud for years, and it has not gotten any better if you want to add
another 200k lines for some unknown amount of time with the hope that a
driver might magically show up one day.
