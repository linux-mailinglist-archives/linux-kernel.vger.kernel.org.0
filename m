hi,
is fifo the best choice? do you need it for plug perf in somewhere?
what's your use case for this?

fifos seem complicated because you need to create 2 of them, would
unix socket be better maybe? and do we really need that ack fd?

also you could pass just path and perf could create fifos from them

  # perf stat --control-fifo /tmp/...

or to get really creazy, we could add option that would make perf
to listen on socket or whatever and we would control it via another
perf command ;-)

  # perf stat --control ....
  control socket: /tmp/xxx

  # perf stat control -s /tmp/xxx disable
  # perf stat control -s /tmp/xxx  enable

but ATM I can't see too much use for this, so would be great to
know your usecase ;-)

thanks,
jirka
