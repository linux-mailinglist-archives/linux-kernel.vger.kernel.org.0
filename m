The problem is that reading from /dev/urandom at a point where it's
not initialized yet results in noisy kernel logging on current
kernels. If you want people to use /dev/urandom then the logging needs
to go away, because it scares people, makes them file bug reports and
so on, even though there isn't actually any problem for these specific
purposes.

For that reason I'd prefer GRND_INSECURE I must say, because it
indicates people grokked "I know I might get questionnable entropy".
