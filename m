U-Boot will configure the PWM with dts setting(and now U-Boot would like 
to sync the dts

from kernel directly):

- no dts node for pwm regulator, it will be default as input IO without 
any configure;

- with pwm regulator dts enable, no 'init-microvolt', enable PWM with 
default 0% output;

- with pwm regulator dts with 'init-microvolt', enable PWM with 
corresponding duty output;

We should leave it not configure(around 0.9V for most of board) or 
configure to correct

output(some boards need 0.95V while default is 0.9V for stability issue).

For the rk3399 boards on upstream, some of them do not have a vdd_log in 
dts,

and others have dts node but without 'init-microvolt' for init setting, 
that's what I want

to fix to make sure all the boards can work correctly.


Thanks,
