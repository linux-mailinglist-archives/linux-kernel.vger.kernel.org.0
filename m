I share your concern about external changes outside the subsystem
breaking things; this doesn't happen all that often with the audit
tree, but it seems to happen every couple of releases with the SELinux
tree.  This is one of the reasons why I test linux/master +
selinux/next + audit/next every few days, if not more often (see link
below).  I've found this regular testing to be extremely helpful, and
if anyone is interested I'd be happy to help you get something similar
going.

FWIW, the reason I don't like basing against -rc1 (or any -rcX tag for
that matter) is that the -rcX releases tend to be buggier than the
"proper" releases.  However, in practice I find myself basing the
selinux/next and audit/next branches against -rc1 almost every release
now; the rate of change outside the subsystem trees is simply too
high.

As far as I'm concerned, whatever makes it easier for Linus to consume
the changes is the preferred path.  My guess is that you are right and
any *significant* changes to the LSM layer itself, e.g. security/*, is
best sent via James' tree.  For smaller changes to the LSM layer I
think it's okay if they go in via an individual LSM tree so long as
all the other LSMs agree-on/ack the changes; which pretty much fits
what we've been doing for some time now and it seems to work well
enough.
