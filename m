Subject: [RFC PATCH] binfmt_elf: Protect mm_struct access with mmap_sem

find_extend_vma assumes the caller holds mmap_sem as a reader (explained
in expand_downwards()). The path when we are extending the stack VMA to
accomodate argv[] pointers happens without the lock.

I was not able to cause an mm_struct corruption but
BUG_ON(!rwsem_is_locked(&mm->mmap_sem)) in find_extend_vma could be
triggered as

    # <bigfile xargs echo
    xargs: echo: terminated by signal 11

(bigfile needs to have more than RLIMIT_STACK / sizeof(char *) rows)

Other accesses to mm_struct in exec path are protected by mmap_sem, so
conservatively, protect also this one. Besides that, explain why we omit
mm_struct.arg_lock in the exec(2) path.

When I was attempting to reduce usage of mmap_sem I came across this
unprotected access and increased number of its holders :-/

I'm not sure whether there is a real concurrent writer at this early
stages (I considered khugepaged especially as setup_arg_pages invokes
khugepaged_enter_vma_merge but we're lucky because khugepaged skips it
because of VM_STACK_INCOMPLETE_SETUP).

A nicer approach would perhaps be to do all this exec setup when the
mm_struct is still not exposed via current->mm (and hence no need to
synchronize via mmap_sem). But I didn't look enough into binfmt specific
whether it is even doable and worth it.

So I'm sending this for a discussion.
