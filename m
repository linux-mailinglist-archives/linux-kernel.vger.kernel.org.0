Heh.

dtor@penguin:~/kernel/work $ git grep -A15 "static struct spi_driver" --
drivers/ | grep "\.driver.*=" | wc -l
272

You will find the similar counts for i2c, and other buses, mostly
because we need to specify driver name, OF/ACPI match tables, and
pointer to PM ops.

So please just keep it in the generic driver structure.

Thanks.
