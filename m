fork() manages that, and so does KSM.  Like KSM, you want to make a page
shared -- you just skip the comparison step as you want to overwrite the old
contents.

And there's no need to touch the page, as fork() manages that fine no matter
if the page is resident, anonymous in swap, or file-backed, all without
reading from swap.
