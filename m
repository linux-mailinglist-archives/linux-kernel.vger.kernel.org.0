map_vm_area() which is an exported symbol suppose to provide the right
error code regardless whether it's current users care for it or not.

Its true that vmap_pte_range() does warn during error conditions. But if
we really dont care about error return code then we should just remove
specific error details (ENOMEM/EBUSY) and instead replace them with simple
boolean false/true or (0/1/-1) return values at each level. Will that be
acceptable ? What we have currently is wrong where vmap_pmd_range() could
just wrap EBUSY as ENOMEM and send up the call chain.
