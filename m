The timestamp was not stored into the safe buffers to keep the code
simple. And people request to add the proper timestamps from time
to time.

IMHO, the precise timestamps are more important than ordering. So
people should love the lockless ringbuffer from this POV ;-)

Right.

OK, it is not a big deal from my POV. It is just an optimization.
It can be removed or improved later.

It caught my eyes primary because prb_read_valid() was relatively
complex function. I was not sure if it was worth the effort. But
I am fine with keeping your code for now. It will help to reduce
unrelated behavior changes.
