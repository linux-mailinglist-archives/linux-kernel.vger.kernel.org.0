Actually... if we have buggy AMD CPU with broken RDRAND, we should
still be able to get enough entropy during boot so that getrandom() is
cryptographically secure.

I don't think we get that right at the moment.

You can. You can just access disk while the userpsace is blocked on
getrandom. ("find /").
