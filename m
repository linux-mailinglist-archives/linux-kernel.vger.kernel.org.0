The IMA logs are event logs for module load time signature 
validation(based on policies) which are backed by the TPM. No SecureBoot 
information is present in the log other than the boot aggregate.

This change is only intended to be executed in the path of 
kexec_file_load and not intended to be executed by any boot loader.(Not 
very aware of boot loader calls.). The logs are non intended to be 
injected by the boot loader at all.
The change is configurable(CONFIG_IMA_KEXEC) under the IMA subsection 
and can be disabled if not needed.

fdt_delete_mem_rsv - is to cleanup any memory that's been mistakenly 
still lying around in the same session while creating the fdt. 
memblock_free is actually used to free up the reserved memory.

Thiago may have more insight, This is primarily a code that's been 
ported from existing kernel for PowerPC.
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/powerpc/kernel/machine_kexec_file_64.c

I don't have an answer to this, just going through the call stack i dont 
believe it depends on ACPI as such. I am not the expert here, but more 
than willing to try out the scenario in question.(Can you point me to 
some documentation to setup some environment to test this.) 
Kexec_file_load call depends purely on DT implementation.


> I'd prefer it we only had one way this works on arm64, so whatever we do has to cover both.
I can move the code to be only part of arm64 arch if absolutely 
necessary. Thiago do you have any concerns on going back the path of 
multiple code paths?

Yes, IMA, the measurement is not dependent on any hardware capabilities.
TPM is needed to back the measurements but the IMA module will not fail 
if TPM is not available.
In short Secure-boot has no impact on IMA.

IMA does not interact with the TPM event log.
Only one of the PCR's is extended but not logged in the TPM logs. The 
logging is done in IMA. The IMA measurement log in question is whats 
needed to be carried over to via kexec_file_load call.

I am not sure if i addressed all your concerns, please let me know
if i missed anything. To me most concerns look to be towards the kexec 
case and dependency on hardware(ACPI/TPM) during boot and early boot 
services, where as carrying the logs is only during the kexec_file_load 
sys call and does not interfere with that code path.
