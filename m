I do believe that it might work for your particular usecase but I do not
think this is robust enough for the upstream kernel, I am afraid.

As I've said I am open to discuss an opt-in per memcg pro-active reclaim
(a kernel thread that belongs to the memcg) but it has to be a dedicated
worker bound by all the cgroup resource restrictions.
