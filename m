Subject: [patch 28/29] x86/hpet: Use common init for legacy clockevent

Replace the static initialization of the legacy clockevent with runtime
initialization utilizing the common init function as the last preparatory
step to switch the legacy clockevent over to the channel 0 storage in
hpet_base.

This comes with a twist. The static clockevent initializer has selected
support for periodic and oneshot mode unconditionally whether the HPET
config advertised periodic mode or not. Even the pre clockevents code did
this. But....

Using the conditional in hpet_init_clockevent() makes at least Qemu and one
hardware machine fail to boot.  There are two issues which cause the boot
failure:

 #1 After the timer delivery test in IOAPIC and the IOAPIC setup the next
    interrupt is not delivered despite the HPET channel being programmed
    correctly. Reprogramming the HPET after switching to IOAPIC makes it
    work again. After fixing this, the next issue surfaces:

 #2 Due to the unconditional periodic mode 'availability' the Local APIC
    timer calibration can hijack the global clockevents event handler
    without causing damage. Using oneshot at this stage makes if hang
    because the HPET does not get reprogrammed due to the handler
    hijacking. Duh, stupid me!

Both issues require major surgery and especially the kick HPET again after
enabling IOAPIC results in really nasty hackery.  This 'assume periodic
works' magic has survived since HPET support got added, so it's
questionable whether this should be fixed. Both Qemu and the failing
hardware machine support periodic mode despite the fact that both don't
advertise it in the configuration register and both need that extra kick
after switching to IOAPIC. Seems to be a feature...

Keep the 'assume periodic works' magic around and add a big fat comment.
