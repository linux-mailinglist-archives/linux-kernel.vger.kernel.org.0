Hi all,

Today's linux-next merge of the pm tree got a conflict in:

  Documentation/power/pm_qos_interface.rst

between commits:

  151f4e2bdc7a ("docs: power: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst")
  562fe2ef1a21 ("PM / QOS: Pass request type to dev_pm_qos_read_value()")

from the pci tree and commit:

  0c4899702720 ("PM / QOS: Pass request type to dev_pm_qos_{add|remove}_not=
ifier()")

from the pm tree.

I fixed it up (see below) and can carry the fix as necessary. This
is now fixed as far as linux-next is concerned, but any non trivial
conflicts should be mentioned to your upstream maintainer when your tree
is submitted for merging.  You may also want to consider cooperating
with the maintainer of the conflicting tree to minimise any particularly
complex conflicts.

Cheers,
Stephen Rothwell
