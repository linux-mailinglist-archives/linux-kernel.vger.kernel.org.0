When a cpu requests broadcasting, before starting the tick broadcast
hrtimer, bc_set_next() checks if the timer callback (bc_handler) is
active using hrtimer_try_to_cancel(). But hrtimer_try_to_cancel() does
not provide the required synchronization when the callback is active on
other core.
The callback could have already executed
tick_handle_oneshot_broadcast() and could have also returned. But still
there is a small time window where the hrtimer_try_to_cancel() returns
-1. In that case bc_set_next() returns without doing anything, but the
next_event of the tick broadcast clock device is already set to a
timeout value.

In the race condition diagram below, CPU #1 is running the timer
callback and CPU #2 is entering idle state and so calls bc_set_next().

In the worst case, the next_event will contain an expiry time, but the
hrtimer will not be started which happens when the racing callback
returns HRTIMER_NORESTART. The hrtimer might never recover if all
further requests from the CPUs to subscribe to tick broadcast have
timeout greater than the next_event of tick broadcast clock device. This
leads to cascading of failures and finally noticed as rcu stall
warnings as shown in [1]

Here is a depiction of the race condition

CPU #1 (Running timer callback)                   CPU #2 (Enter idle
                                                  and subscribe to
                                                  tick broadcast)
---------------------                             ---------------------

__run_hrtimer()                                   tick_broadcast_enter()

  bc_handler()                                      __tick_broadcast_oneshot_control()

    tick_handle_oneshot_broadcast()

      raw_spin_lock(&tick_broadcast_lock);

      dev->next_event = KTIME_MAX;                  //wait for tick_broadcast_lock
      //next_event for tick broadcast clock
      set to KTIME_MAX since no other cores
      subscribed to tick broadcasting

      raw_spin_unlock(&tick_broadcast_lock);

    if (dev->next_event == KTIME_MAX)
      return HRTIMER_NORESTART
    // callback function exits without
       restarting the hrtimer                      //tick_broadcast_lock acquired
                                                   raw_spin_lock(&tick_broadcast_lock);

                                                   tick_broadcast_set_event()

                                                     clockevents_program_event()

                                                       dev->next_event = expires;

                                                       bc_set_next()

                                                         hrtimer_try_to_cancel()
                                                         //returns -1 since the timer
                                                         callback is active. Exits without
                                                         restarting the timer
  cpu_base->running = NULL;

Since it is now allowed to start the hrtimer from the callback, there is
no need for the try to cancel logic. All that is now removed.
