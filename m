Well, I'm moving that to a helper exactly to avoid drm gem ttm helpers
messing with ttm internals.  To not them initialize vm_flags for
example, and to avoid exporting ttm_bo_vm_ops.  Also to make sure ttm bo
vma's are initialized the same way no matter which code path was taken
to mmap the object.

No, the check in that function prevents that from working.
