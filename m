Sorry. I'll pay attention to this next time.

Sorry, I didn't describe it clearly.
S4 means "suspend to disk".
In s4, The its will reinit and malloc an new its address.

My expectation is to reprogram the ITS with original mappings. If ITS_FLAGS_SAVE_SUSPEND_STATE
is not set, i'll have no chance to use the original its table mappings.

What should i do if i want to restore its state with hcc == 0?

Thanks,
Hongbo.
