It is strange to make the structure visible in sysfs before
we initialize it.

IMHO, separate kobject_del() makes only sense when the sysfs
interface must be destroyed before some other actions.

I guess that we need two examples. I currently understand
it the following way:

1. sysfs interface and the structure can be freed anytime:

   	struct A
	{
		struct kobject kobj;
		...
	};

	void fn(void)
	{
		struct A *a;
		int ret;

		a = kzalloc(sizeof(*a), GFP_KERNEL);
		if (!a)
			return;

		/*
		 * Initialize structure before we make it accessible via
		 * sysfs.
		 */
		ret = some_init_fn();
		if (ret) {
			goto init_err;
		}

		ret = kobject_init_and_add(&a->kobj, ktype, NULL, "foo");
		if (ret)
			goto kobj_err;

		return 0;

	kobj_err:
		/* kobject_init() always succeds and take reference. */
		kobject_put(kobj);
		return ret;

	init_err:
		/* kobject was not initialized, simple free is enough */
		kfree(a);
		return ret;
	}


2. Structure must be registered into the subsystem before
   it can be made visible via sysfs:

   	struct A
	{
		struct kobject kobj;
		...
	};

	void fn(void)
	{
		struct A *a;
		int ret;

		a = kzalloc(sizeof(*a), GFP_KERNEL);
		if (!a)
			return;

		ret = some_init_fn();
		if (ret) {
			goto init_err;
		}

		/*
		 * Structure is in a reasonable state and can be freed
		 * via the kobject release callback.
		 */
		kobject_init(&a->kobj);

		/*
		 * Register the structure so that it can cooperate
		 * with the rest of the system.
		 */
		ret = register_fn(a);
`		if (ret)
			goto register_err;


		/* Make it visible via sysfs */
		ret = kobject_add(&a->kobj, ktype, NULL, "foo");
		if (ret) {
			goto kobj_add_err;
		}

		/* Manipulate the structure somehow */
		ret = action_fn(a);
		if (ret)
			goto action_err;

		mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);
		return 0;

	action_err:
		/*
		 * Destroy sysfs interface but the structure
		 * is still needed.
		 */
		kobject_del(&a->kboject);
	kobject_add_err:
		/* Make it invisible to the system. */
		unregister_fn(a);
	register_err:
		/* Release the structure unsing the kobject callback */
		kobject_put(&a->kobj);
		return;

	init_err:
		/*
		 * Custom init failed. Kobject release callback would do
		 * a double free or so. Simple free is enough.
		 */
		 kfree(a);
	}

I would really prefer if we clearly understand where each variant makes
sense before we start modifying the code and documentation.

Petr
