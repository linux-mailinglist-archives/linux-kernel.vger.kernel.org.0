That would be another possibility.

But given more maintainers are starting to apply patchwork bundles (cfr.
the workflows discussions), it makes sense to make their lives easier.

This is also useful for maintainers who save all patches to apply into a
single mbox, and run checkpatch+git-am on that.

Summarized: git-am handles multiple patches, checkpatch requires
splitting.

Thanks!
