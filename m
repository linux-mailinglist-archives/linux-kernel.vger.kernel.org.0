Your note above is what I meant by "it probably wouldn't be used" because
I don't have much insight into the history behind why LDR is being initialized
in the first place. The only evidence I found is a comment in apic.c that states:
	/*
	 * Intel recommends to set DFR, LDR and TPR before enabling
	 * an APIC.  See e.g. "AP-388 82489DX User's Manual" (Intel
	 * document number 292116).  So here it goes...
	 */
That said, not initalizing the ldr in bigsmp_init_apic_ldr() should be
enough to fix this. Would you prefer that change instead ?

This is the guest kernel and KVM takes care of injecting the interrupt to
the right vcpu (recalculate_apic_map)() in lapic.c). 

For the KVM side change, please take a look at
https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/aee50952-144d-78da-9036-045bd3838b59@redhat.com/

Heh, no it's not.
