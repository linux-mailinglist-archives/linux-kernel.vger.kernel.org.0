I think it's more natural for process_madvise to be a superset of
regular madvise. What's the harm? There are no security implications,
since anyone who could process_madvise could just ptrace anyway. I
also don't think limiting the hinting to non-destructive operations
guarantees safety (in a broad sense) either, since operating on the
wrong memory range can still cause unexpected system performance
issues even if there's no data loss.

More broadly, what I want to see is a family of process_* APIs that
provide a superset of the functionality that the existing intraprocess
APIs provide. I think this approach is elegant and generalizes easily.
I'm worried about prematurely limiting the interprocess memory APIs
and creating limitations that will last a long time in order to avoid
having to consider issues like VMA synchronization.
