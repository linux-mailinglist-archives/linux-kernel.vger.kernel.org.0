Yes, with SMT off KVM could allow the guest to enable split lock #AC, but
for the initial implementation we'd want to allow it if and only if split
lock #AC is disabled in the host kernel.  Otherwise we have to pull in the
logic to control whether or not a guest can disable split lock #AC, what
to do if a split lock #AC happens when it's enabled by the host but
disabled by the guest, etc...
