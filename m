I agree on id and proto_id part easily and the seq may not be unique
if and only if the previous command has completed.

Not 100% sure on that. I remember one of the issue you reported where OS
times out and platform may still be processing it. That's one of the
case where seq id may get re-assigned, but now that's fixed and the
scenario may not happen. I am trying to understand why you think it
is not unique ?

I am not sure if we need to maintain a tracker/counter just for trace
purposes.

I am interested in the scenario we can make use of this and also help
in testing it if we add this. I am not against it but I don't see the
need for it.
