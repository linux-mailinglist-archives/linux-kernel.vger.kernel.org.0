Could we just force kfree_loops >= 4?  Complain if not, set it to 4?

Let's see what we end up with.

You get similar errors by only sampling four times, though.  Assuming a
reasonably long test run compared to the typical grace-period duration,
each of the four samples has a 50% chance of being above the median,
thus a 1/16 chance of all four samples being above the median.

No argument in general, but consistent numbers do not rule out the
possibility of a deterministic bias.

OK, I will keep it as is for now and let's look again later on.  It is not
in the bucket for the upcoming merge window in any case, so we do have
quite a bit of time.

It is not that I hate it, but rather that I want to be able to give
good answers to questions that might come up.  And given that I have
occasionally given certain people a hard time about their statistics,
it is only reasonable to expect them to return the favor.  I wouldn't
want you to be caught in the crossfire.  ;-)

My thoughts are to use an explicit flag to catch the first-time case,
take something like 30 samples as the default, and restructure the loop
a bit to reduce at least some of the indentation.

But let's keep it on the back burner for a bit while we get other things
sorted out.
