I'm not unsympathetic to the cause of small-memory systems, but this is
useful as-is for x86, especially for VMAP_STACK. arm64 and s390 have
already been able to make use of it as well. So unless the design is
going to make it difficult to extend to small-memory systems - if it
bakes in concepts or APIs that are going to make things harder - I think
it might be worth merging as is. (pending the fixes for documentation
nits etc that you point out.)

I'm not sure how much of a difference it will make, but I'll have a look.

This code as currently written will not work if the architecture maps
the zero page over the portion of the shadow region that covers the
vmalloc space. So it's an implementation 'must' rather than a laws of
the universe 'must'.

We could perhaps map the zero page, but:

 - you have to be really careful to get it right. If you accidentally
   map the zero page onto memory where you shouldn't, you may permit
   memory accesses that you should catch.

   We could ameliorate this by taking Mark's suggestion and mapping a
   poision page over the vmalloc space instead.

 - I'm not sure what benefit is provided by having something mapped vs
   leaving a hole, other than making the fault addresses more obvious.

 - This gets complex, especially to do swapping correctly with respect
   to various architectures' quirks (see e.g. 56eecdb912b5 "mm: Use
   ptep/pmdp_set_numa() for updating _PAGE_NUMA bit" - ppc64 at least
   requires that set_pte_at is never called on a valid PTE).

I suppose. It's pretty easy on at least x86 and my draft ppc64
implementation to identify when an access falls into the shadow region
and then to reverse engineer the memory access that was being checked
based on the offset. As Andy points out, the fault handler could do this
automatically.

I'm not opposed to this in principle but I am also concerned about the
complexity involved.
