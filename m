The primary point here is that there is a demand of non blockable mmu
notifiers to be called when the oom reaper tears down the address space.
As the oom reaper is the primary guarantee of the oom handling forward
progress it cannot be blocked on anything that might depend on blockable
memory allocations. These are not really easy to track because they
might be indirect - e.g. notifier blocks on a lock which other context
holds while allocating memory or waiting for a flusher that needs memory
to perform its work. If such a blocking state happens that we can end up
in a silent hang with an unusable machine.
Now we hope for reasonable implementations of mmu notifiers (strong
words I know ;) and this should be relatively simple and effective catch
all tool to detect something suspicious is going on.

Does that make the situation more clear?
