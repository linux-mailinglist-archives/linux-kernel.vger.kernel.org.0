The key here is 'a subdir' which is not the case here. We did discuss
this in the initial patches for SoundWire which had sysfs :)

The way MIPI disco spec organized properties, we have dp0 and dpN
properties each of them requires to have a subdir of their own and that
was the reason why I coded it to be creating a device.

Do we have a better way to handle this?
