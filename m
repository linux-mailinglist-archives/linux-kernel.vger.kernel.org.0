Hi all,

Thanks a lot for this, Richard:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mtd/linux.git/log/?h=mtd%2Fnext&qt=grep&q=fall-through

There are only two of these warnings left to be addressed in
MTD[1]:

        This looks strange.

        In ONENAND_DEVICE_DENSITY_2Gb:
        ONENAND_HAS_UNLOCK_ALL is set unconditionally.

        But then, under ONENAND_DEVICE_DENSITY_1Gb, the same option is set only
        if process is evaluated to true.

        Same problem with ONENAND_HAS_2PLANE:
        - it is set in ONENAND_DEVICE_DENSITY_4Gb only if ONENAND_IS_DDP()
        - it is unset in ONENAND_DEVICE_DENSITY_2Gb only if !ONENAND_IS_DDP()

        Maybe this portion should be reworked because I am unsure if this is a
        missing fall through or a bug.


Thanks
