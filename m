So you are saying that the problem occurs when the card is removed
during this 100ms period?

I assume there a way for sdhci to re-validate whether the card has
been removed during this period, right?

It sounds like you should call mmc_detect_change(), after the reset to
let the core check for cards that may have been removed/inserted.

Would that work?
