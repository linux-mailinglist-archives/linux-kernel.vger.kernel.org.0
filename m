Good point! But this will be an issue even if we use the non-underscore
version as I don't think it will disable interrupt. Also it is only a
problem if the percpu operation is more than 1 instruction. It is a
single instruction for x86. Other architectures may require more than 1
instruction. In those cases, we may lose count, but it is still better
than getting the count from one CPU and put it into another CPU.
