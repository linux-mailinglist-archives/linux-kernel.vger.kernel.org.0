I can envision a fairly straightforward approach of flipping things 
upside-down such that we register a hotplug instance for the IRQ rather 
than the PMU, then handle the association of PMUs to IRQs internally to 
the driver. I believe I need to support this case in my CMN PMU driver 
too, so I'll prototype something there and see how it looks.
