Something really weird is going on with the word wrapping in your mail,
it looks like you're writing lines longer than 80 characters (120?) and
they're getting a newline added in the middle of the line to wrap them
without reflowing the paragraph.

Well, it doesn't *have* to be the raw register value, more accurately
it's some token which is useful for passing to and from the hardware;=20
The documentation such as it
is is in the documentation of the list_voltage() operation (which is
what defines the selector values for a given driver). =20

Your idea of very basic implementations is how the overwhelming majority
of hardware is implemented.  Regulators with register maps will tend to
just have a bitfield where you set the voltage with each valid value in
that bitfield mapped to a single voltage, the exceptions tend to use
direct voltage values instead (and not support enumeration at all).

Looking at the driver I think it's got what the helpers are terming
pickable linear ranges (naming is hard) and could use those helpers.

I don't know what a "virtualized selector mapping" is...  We do have an
extensive range of helper implementations which cover the majority of
cases, are you sure that none of these cover what the hardware is doing?

I appreciate that the existing code is a bit of a mess but as you can
see it's making it difficult to maintain so I'd rather push towards
making it cleaner, it looks like we're getting more and more devices
added to the driver so it's actually an issue. =20

Please add whatever documentation you're looking for here.  I genuinely
don't know where people would look for that and TBH I'm having a hard
time figuring out why you'd implement the operations asymmetrically.
It's not an issue that ever comes up.
