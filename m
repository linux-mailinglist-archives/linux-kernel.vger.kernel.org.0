Sure, we could not rely on kthreads in panic(). In this situation
any lock taken from console->write() callback is a possible source
of a deadlock.

Note that I say that the locks are the problem and not printk()
called under these locks. It is because:

  + The experience shows that we could not prevent people from
    using printk() anywhere.

  + printk() might get called even when it is not used explicitly.
    For example, from NMI, IRQ, Oops.


So, the best solution is to avoid as many locks in console->write()
callbacks as possible. Especially this means as less dependencies
on external subsystems as possible. MM is an obvious candidate.
We should avoid calling MM not only because it uses locks but
also because there might not be any available memory.

Of course, there are better and worse console drivers. It is hard
to expect that all will or can be made safe. From the printk()
point of view, the defense against the problematic consoles
might be:

   + Classify each console driver. Flush all messages to the most
     reliable consoles first and to the least reliable ones at last.

   + Prevent calling consoles when there is other way to preserve
     the messages over the reboot, e.g. crashdump or permanent memory.


Of course, we will still need a way how to actively search for
problems in advance. For example, printk() could use a fake
lock even during the normal operation so that it could trigger
lockdep splat. We could enable it after all the init calls
are proceed to reduce the number of false positives.


Hmm, this discussion probably belongs to another thread about
printk() design.

Anyway, it seems that removing MM from console->write() calls
is a win-win solution.

Petr
