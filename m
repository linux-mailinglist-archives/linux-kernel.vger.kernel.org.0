It's not just an optimization for Ion though. Ion was designed to
let the callers choose between system and multiple CMA heaps. On other
systems there may be multiple CMA regions dedicated to a specific
purpose or placed at a specific address. The callers need to
be able to choose exactly whether they want a particular CMA region
or discontiguous regions.
