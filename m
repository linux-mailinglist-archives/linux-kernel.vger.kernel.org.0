Sorry for not addressing this remark. I am trying to be careful and not
steer you to a certain implementation. I failed to achieve what you are
attempting. You are already doing things slightly different, so my
experiences regarding this may falsely discourage you from figuring out
how to do it.

To address your question: For the linked list implementation, if you are
looking at it from the linked list perspective, the number of
descriptors on the list is constantly fluctuating (increasing and
decreasing) and the ordering of the descriptors is constantly
changing. They are ordered according to the writer commit order (not the
writer reserve order) and the only descriptors on the list are the ones
that are not within a reserve/commit window.

No. The variable size of the records was the reason I used
descriptors. That has nothing to do with how I chose to connect those
descriptors.

There are a lot of details hiding in the words "exactly as a ring
buffer". We are talking about a (truly) lockless ringbuffer that
supports concurrent writers. (IMO my v1 rfc ringbuffer was not truly
lockless because of the prb_lock.) AFAIK there is no such ringbuffer
implementation in existence, otherwise I would have used that instead of
writing my own.

I think it is not as simple as you think it is and I expect you will end
up with a solution that is more complex (although I could be
wrong). IMHO the linked list solution is quite elegant. Perhaps the real
problem is my coding style, poor naming, and horrible comments.

You really already answered your own question when you stated:

    "we could achieve similar result when using the array
     as a circular buffer"

That circular buffer must have the same features as the circular buffer
we are trying to implement. My choice to use a linked list was not due
to variable sized records, but rather that is the only way I could
figure out how to implement a lockless multi-writer multi-reader
ringbuffer.

Again, that doesn't mean it isn't possible. But _I_ could not get it to
work. I had all kinds of state tracking and crazy cmpxchg loops and
wacky races. Switching to linked lists made everything so much simpler
and straight forward. (Many thanks my colleague Benedikt Spranger for
coming up with the idea!)

This is why I reserve the descriptor before reserving the data, so that
this situation can never occur.

Note that invalid descriptors in the linked list do not act as
terminators for readers. The readers simply traverse over the invalid
descriptors until they hit an EOL.

desc->seq is not some random data. If it is >= rb->first_seq (and points
back to the same data block!), it is what you are looking for.

_All_ descriptors on the linked list are not within the reserve/commit
window and no writers have pointers to them. (The only exception is the
newest descriptor, whose next will be modified by a writer that is
adding a new descriptor. That is the reason that if there is only 1
descriptor on the list, it must not be removed. A writer might be
modifying its next.)

When a writer wants to reserve data (i.e. enter the reserve/commit
window), the first thing it must do is pull a descriptor off the
list. With the descriptor off the list, the writer is free to do
whatever it needs to do to prepare the data and the descriptor. And when
it is done committing (i.e. exiting the reserve/commit window), the last
thing it does is add the ready descriptor to the list.

I also built it for the first time so that I could document this series.

There is an obvious push to get the kernel docs unified under RST, even
if it is not how I usually do things either. However, now that I've done
the work, looking back it seems to be a good idea in order to automate
documentation.

But are you used to starting with last and traversing next to first? The
descriptors and data blocks are linked from oldest to newest. IMHO that
is why it tends to be confusing.

In circular buffer speak, writers write to the head and readers read
from the tail. As a writer this feels natural, but for a reader that
reads the tail and follows next pointers to the head, it feels
backwards.

I explicitly wanted to get away from any preconceptions. By specifying
we have data linked from oldest to newest, I find it feels more natural,
regardless if I am a writer writing new records to the newest or a
reader reading all records from oldest to newest.
