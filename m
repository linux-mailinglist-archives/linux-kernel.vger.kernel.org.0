Yes, that would be much better if we can sort out some other issues below...

I've found a couple of problems with the patch:

1) port->subsystems will always be empty before nvmet_disable_port() is
called. We'd have to restructure things a little perhaps so that when a
subsystem is removed from a port, all the active controllers for that
subsys/port combo would be removed.

2) loop needs to call flush_workqueue(nvme_delete_wq) somewhere,
otherwise there's a small window after the port disappears while
commands can still be submitted. We can actually still hit the bug with
a tight loop.

Maybe there's other cleanup that could be done to solve this: it does
seem like all three transports need to keep their own lists of open
controllers and loops through them to delete them. In theory, that could
be made common so there's common code to manage the list per transport
which would remove some boiler plate code. If we want to go this route
though, I'd suggest using my patches as is for now and doing the cleanup
in the next cycle.
