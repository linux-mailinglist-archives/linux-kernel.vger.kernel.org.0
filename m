They aren't when we use a generic SVA handler. Following a call to
iommu_sva_bind_device(), iommu-sva.c allocates an IOASID and store an
mm_struct. If auxiliary domains are also enabled for the device,
following a call to iommu_aux_attach_device() the IOMMU driver allocates
an IOASID and stores some private object.

Now for example the IOMMU driver receives a PPR and calls ioasid_find()
with @set = NULL. ioasid_find() may return either an mm_struct or a
private object, and the driver cannot know which it is so the returned
value is unusable.

Thanks,
Jean
