The firmware (and the dts) uses a simple-framebuffer. You won't get
any nifty features, but you'll get a framebuffer.

Hopefully we'll get a proper DRM video soon. The status is roughly
as follows:

LCDC: potentially supported by the Armada DRM driver. Patches sent to
Russell King some months ago, not there yet. I'd prefer not to nag him.

DCON: Russell dislikes the idea of a DRM bridge, DRM maintainers prefer
if the driver was not a DRM encoder driver. This seems to require
quite some work to fix [1].

GPU: supported by the etnaviv driver, good enough for 2D acceleration
to work with xorg-x11-video-armada driver. 3D (weston and mutter alike)
is broken. To add this to the device tree, the clock and power needs
to be figured out.
