The wake list stuff is separate from the original purpose of the IPI, which
is to hit the need_resched check on IRQ exit.  When that happens, the
scheduler will call into RCU, even if it doesn't change threads.

If the testing isn't done on machines that can't do the IPI then it's
basically option #1.  FWIW I don't think option #1 is unreasonable given
that we're talking about very old and/or specialized hardware, and we're
only talking about delays, not a crash (maybe limit the ability to use
nohz_full on such hardware?).  Of course if it turns out people are actually
trying to run (modern versions of) RT on such hardware, that might be
different. :-)

Yeah, I considered that but was hesitant due to overhead -- at least in the
case of the example I gave (pre-APIC x86), arming a oneshot timer is pretty
slow.  Plus, some hardware might entirely lack one-shot timer capability.

I was assuming any hardware that can't do smp_send_reschedule() is not SMP.

Sure.  I was just concerned by the "Linus was against enforcing this in the
past" comment and was hoping for more details.
