This isn't going to work.

This is the hunk that doesn't apply anymore.

The general thought is that it would be good to _not_ call the device
link APIs from deep within the clk parent changing code or even parent
initialization code. It would be better to make device links based on
the possible parents of a clk controller when the clk is registered and
after the clk prepare lock (i.e. the registration lock) is dropped. Is
this possible? The problem is that we're deeply nested in locks that are
already hard to reason about and get out from underneath. I don't want
to get into some sort of ABBA deadlock scenario with the PM core. The
usage of runtime PM in the clk framework is probably busted right now
because it is used under the prepare lock. Ugh.

Is it necessary to add the device links between different clk
controllers either? I mean, is it necessary to create links between clks
and their parents right now?  Maybe we can take the easy way out and
just make links between devices that call clk_get() and the devices that
provide those clks (the consumer side). I suppose you may want to order
suspend/resume of a device with the parent clks of some clk that is
acquired from clk_get(). I hope it isn't required though, because this
is a problem to do with ordering suspend/resume of the clk tree itself,
which isn't really solved at all.

We probably need to solve that by doing something clk provider specific
in the clk framework to figure out a way for device drivers that provide
clks to get callbacks to suspend/resume clks in the clk tree in some
sort of topo-sorted order. That way we can traverse the clk tree and
call down into provider drivers for each clk it registered to do things
like restore the clk frequency or clk enable/prepare state, etc. It
needs to be done in a certain order and it's not possible to flatten
that order into a sequential list of providers (that correspond 1:1 with
devices) given that there are loops between providers.

But from the perspective of a consumer driver like PCI, I don't see why
it needs to care about the clk tree suspend/resume ordering details. It
really only cares that the clk it's consuming, at the edge of the tree,
is resumed before the consumer itself, PCI, is resumed. However the
dependencies of that clk it's consuming is managed, be it with device
links or something clk framework specific, doesn't matter to the PCI
driver. And other clks that are parents or grandparents of the clk
consumed by PCI could have device link dependencies themselves, on
something like an i2c controller or such. Even then, we don't need to
use device links in the clk tree to describe ordering between clks. We
can do it without device links and break the device link chain when it
crosses the clk tree.

  PCI -[device link]-> PCI leaf clk provider -[clk framework ordering black=
 box]-> parent of leaf clk -[device link]-> i2c controller=20
