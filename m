I agree with this approach and the semantics. But these names are very
vague and extremely easy to confuse since they're so similar.

MADV_COLD could be a good name, but for deactivating pages, not
reclaiming them - marking memory "cold" on the LRU for later reclaim.

For the immediate reclaim one, I think there is a better option too:
In virtual memory speak, putting a page into secondary storage (or
ensuring it's already there), and then freeing its in-memory copy, is
called "paging out". And that's what this flag is supposed to do. So
how about MADV_PAGEOUT?

With that, we'd have:

MADV_FREE: Mark data invalid, free memory when needed
MADV_DONTNEED: Mark data invalid, free memory immediately

MADV_COLD: Data is not used for a while, free memory when needed
MADV_PAGEOUT: Data is not used for a while, free memory immediately

What do you think?
