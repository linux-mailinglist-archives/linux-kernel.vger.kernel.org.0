Hi, Matthew

Thanks for your comment.

I took a look into the MREMAP_FIXED case, but still not clear in which case it
fall into the situation Kirill mentioned.

Per my understanding, move mapping is achieved in two steps:

    * unmap some range in old vma if old_len >= new_len
    * move vma

If the length doesn't change, we are expecting to have the "copy" of old
vma. This doesn't change the THP PMD mapping.

So the change still happens in the unmap step, if I am correct.

Would you mind giving me more hint on the case when we would have the
situation as Kirill mentioned?
