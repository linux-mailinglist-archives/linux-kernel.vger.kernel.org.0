I do miss a lot of stuff so I might be wrong, but I can't see any other
way this can happen.  The out_callback will unconditionally clear the
IN_USE flag and wake up the wait_queue.

Sure, but I've never seen that happen without the device falling off the
bus.  Which is a disconnect.

But I am all for handling this *if* someone reproduces it with a real
device.  I just don't think it's worth the effort if it's only a
theoretical problem.

Sure, we need to handle malicious devices.  But only if they can be used
for real harm.

This warning requires physical acceess and is only slightly annoying.
Like a USB device making loud farting sounds.  You'd just disconnect the
device.  No need for Linux to detect the sound and handle it
automatically, I think.
