It seems to be the case. CPU2 is clearly flushing per-CPU buffers
from NMI context, for example:

[ 1098.703114][    C2] NMI backtrace for cpu 0
[...]
[ 1098.703295][    C2] NMI backtrace for cpu 3

A solution would be to store all these metadata (timestamp, caller
info) already into the per-CPU buffers. I think that it would be
doable.

But much better solution is a lockless ring buffer. John Ogness is
working hard on it. The plan is to have it ready for 5.5 or 5.6.
I would prefer to concentrate on this solution for the moment.

Best Regards,
Petr
