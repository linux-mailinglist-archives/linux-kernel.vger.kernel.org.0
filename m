I don't remember the suggestion specifically, sorry.  But how would you
figure out what those "safe addresses" really are?  They will change on
every single platform.

And why would this even help anything?  What lock dependency?

I never said that.

Ok, like I said, configuring serial ports as root is a stupid operation
to think it is totally safe :)

Yes, but it gives you a huge hint that this is something that you could
do as root that is "bad" and can harm the system.

They all might not be correct, but again they provide a hint.

So fuzz kernels are not real?  :)
