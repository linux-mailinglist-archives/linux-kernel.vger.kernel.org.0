Sorry, but if there's duplicate effort that's kinda your (OpenWRT folks)
fault: since when OpenWRT is the central point for kernel drivers?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember seeing this driver posted
to the MTD ML. Plus, the driver you're pointing to still implements the
legacy hooks and is based on 4.19, and it has been decided that all new
NAND controller drivers should implement the new ->exec_op() hook
instead.
