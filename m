Yes, passing the relevant device when allocating the default domain so
that the IOMMU driver could make right decision seems to be a better
solution. Somebody can come up with a patch set to bring this up for
discussion. I won't include this in this patch set since it's not for
that purpose. I will follow the existing mechanism that is using on amd
and other iommu drivers.
