I'd really appreciate some attention on this.  Should I have marked
the subject as sched: instead?

I heard through some back-channels that there may be concern with the
ability to use more cpu than allocated in a given period.  To that I
say,
#1 The current behavior of an application hitting cpu throttling while
simultaneously accounting for much less cpu time than was allocated is
a very poor user experience. i.e. granted .5 cpu, but only used .1 cpu
while simultaneously hitting throttling.
#2 This has been broken like this since at least 3.16-rc1 which is why
I ripped out most of the logic instead of trying to patch it again.  I
proved this experimentally by adding a counter in
expire_cfs_rq_runtime when runtime is expired.  I can share the
patches if that would help.  That means that user-interactive
applications have been able to over-use quota in a similar manner
since June 2014, and no one has noticed or complained.  Now that the
mechanism is "fixed" people are starting to notice and they are
complaining loudly.  See
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/67577 and the many
linked tickets to that one.
#3 Even though it's true that you can use more cpu than allocated in a
period, that would require that you under-use quota in previous
periods equal to the overage.  In effect you are still enforcing the
quota requirements albeit over longer time-frames than cfs_period_us
*(I'm amenable to a documentation update to fix this nuance).
Additionally any single cpu run queue can only over-use by as much as
sched_cfs_bandwidth_slice_us which defaults to 5ms.  So other
applications on the same processor will at most be hindered by that
amount.
#4 cpu-bound applications will not be able to over-use in any period,
as the entirety of their quota will be consumed every period.

Your review would be much appreciated.
Thank you,
Dave
