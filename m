This was an original mistake of the dmaengine implementation that
Vinod inherited. Module pinning is distinct from preventing device
unbind which ultimately can't be prevented. Longer term I think we
need to audit dmaengine consumers to make sure they are prepared for
the driver to be removed similar to how other request based drivers
can gracefully return an error status when the device goes away rather
than crashing.
