Heh. Again, I am not arguing, but...

OK, lets suppose we blindly add READ_ONCE() to every access of
task->state/exit_state.

Yes, this won't hurt and possibly can fix some bugs we are not aware of.

However,

The change above can't fix the problem like this.

It is not that this code lacked READ_ONCE(). I am sure me and others
understood that this code can read ->exit_state more than once, just
nobody noticed that in this case this is really wrong.

IOW, if we simply change the code before 3245d6acab98 to use READ_ONCE()
the code will be equally wrong, and

this change will simply hide the problem from kcsan.
