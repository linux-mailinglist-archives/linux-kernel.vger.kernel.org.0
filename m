 not for execution. SGX enclave pages have EPCM enforced permissions. So fr=
om SELinux point of view I would think it can treat it as RO and that's fin=
e.

As an example, SELinux has an =E2=80=9Cexecute=E2=80=9D permission (via
security_mmap_file =E2=80=94 see file_map_prot_check()) that controls wheth=
er
you can execute code from that file.  If you lack this permission on a
file, you may still be able to map it PROT_READ, but you may not map
it PROT_EXEC.  Similarly, if you want to malloc() some memory, write
*code* to it, and execute it, you need a specific permission.

So, unless we somehow think it=E2=80=99s okay for SGX to break the existing
model, we need to respect these restrictions in the SGX driver. In
other words, we either need to respect execmem, etc or require
PROT_EXEC or the equivalent. I like the latter a lot more.
