FWIW, it looks like CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE is set in x86 defconfigs.

Reminds me of https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=fd9dde6abcb9bfe6c6bee48834e157999f113971
(but maybe unrelated?).

I don't recall specific cases where KASLR made debugging difficult.  I
went and spoke to our stability team that debugs crash reports from
the field.  My understanding is that we capture full ramdumps.  They
have a lot of custom tooling for debugging, but they did not recall
ever having to disable KASLR to debug further.  We've had KASLR
enabled since I think the 2016 Pixel 1, so I assume their tooling
accounts for the seed/offset.

I think if a full ramdump of the kernel image is loaded into GDB with
the matching kernel image it "just works" but could be mistaken.  For
external developers, "nokaslr" boot time param is pretty standard.

I spoke with the android common kernel team that's trying to burn down
their out of tree patches.  I triple checked a doc they had where they
had audited every last patch, looking for for KASLR and
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE.  I also triple checked our internal bug tracker
for burning down the out of tree patches.  Finally I'm scanning each
branch of our android-common trees via `git log --all --grep
<KASLR|CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE>`.  I haven't found anything yet, and the
team doesn't expect any out of tree patches related to that feature.
Sorry for not responding sooner, but I'm still going through our 4.4,
4.9, 4.14, and 4.19 branches.

I know I put some backports into an unreleased device's kernel to
support LLD (backports of some of your patches).  All of those patches
are now upstream in mainline, and LLD has its bugs fixed.  In fact, I
think the backports I did of your patches that broke
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE were actually to support LLD (not Clang) (sorry
again for that).  I'm currently upgrading AOSP's prebuilt version of
Clang.  Once that exists, I'll clean up that device's kernel.

If you know of any android vendor relying on out of tree hacks to
KASLR, and they're getting them from android common kernels, please
shoot me a quick email.  Every out of tree patch is a burden IMO.

Also, for internal code reviews of backports, I've been much
better/more aggressive about the backports being sent to stable (when
they aren't large features) and then pulling them in from there
(sorry, Sami).

+ Kees, Sami, Jeff
It's a relatively low cost part of our defense in depth strategy.
Maybe (Kees, Sami, Jeff) have more thoughts?

(Note to Sami + Jeff if they had KPTI on their radar)

Olof mentioned on IRC that I should resend without the other defconfig
changes.  Do others have thoughts on that?
