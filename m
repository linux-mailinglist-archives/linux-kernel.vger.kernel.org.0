The boot command line is calculated and added to the current running
kernel's measurement list.  On a soft reboot like kexec, the PCRs are
not reset to zero.  Refer to commit 94c3aac567a9 ("ima: on soft
reboot, restore the measurement list") patch description.

Please update this paragraph to reflect the current patch set.

The log isn't "injected" into the next kernel, but needs to be carried
over, as described in the above referenced commit.
