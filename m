Niklas / Hans,

Thanks for the feedback. I thought that the goal of any 'compatible'
device should be to be configured identically. If that's not the case
then we need more discussion for sure.

There are 3 registers being changed by this patch which do the
following for the adv7182/adv7280/adv7181/adv7282:
- change output from BT656-3 to BT656-4 (as the driver does this for adv718=
0)
- enable NEWAVMODE meaning EAV/SAV codes are configurable (new code
but adv7180 enables this by power-on default and adv7280 does not)
- configure V bit end count (to be what adv7180 uses; this isn't used
if NEWAVMODE is disabled)

So its not only the question of how to decide to configure BT656-3 vs
BT656-4 but how to deal with differences in the EAV/SAV codes. I'm not
an expert so I don't know what configuration is BT656 compliant and of
course without knowing who is using these devices we can't tell what
would break even if we fix something that may be misconfigured already
(or even completely unused).

I'm cc'ing Steve Longerbeam as well as at one point he was suggesting
adding a 'newavmode' property to the adv7180 bindings and likely
recalls the discussions there.
