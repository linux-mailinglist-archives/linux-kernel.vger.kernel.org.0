Because we might have non monochrome displays where the display is not
readable when the backlight is off and for the sake of to be consistent?
Flickering backlight is not really a nice thing during boot.

I should have been nagging you about it ;)

I think the v2 patch from me should apply just fine and it has the gpio
read as well, if not, then I might not be able to resend as I'm out of
