The problem is that the acpi tables are _wrong_ in this and other cases.
They not only incorrectly report the area as reserved, but also report
the command and response buffer sizes incorrectly. If you look at
the addresses for the buffers listed in the crb control area, the sizes
are correct (4Kbytes).  My patch uses the control area values, and
everything works. The remaining problem is that if acpi reports the
area as NVS, then the linux nvs driver will try to use the space.
I'm looking at how to fix that. I'm not sure, if simply removing
the busy bit is sufficient.
