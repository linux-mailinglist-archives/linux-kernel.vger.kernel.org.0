The patch

   ASoC: simple-card: Don't create separate link when platform is present

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.5

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: simple-card: Don't create separate link when platform
 is present

In normal sound case all DAIs are detected as CPU-Codec.
simple_dai_link_of supports the presence of a platform but it counts
it as a CPU DAI resulting in the creation of an extra link.

Adding a platform property to a link description like:

simple-audio-card,dai-link {
	cpu {
		sound-dai = <&sai1>;
	};
	plat {
		sound-dai = <&dsp>;
	};
	codec {
		sound-dai = <&wm8960>;
	}

will result in the creation of two links:
	* sai1 <-> wm8960
	* dsp  <-> wm8960

which is obviously not what we want. We just want one single link
with:
	* sai1 <-> wm8960 (and platform set to dsp).
