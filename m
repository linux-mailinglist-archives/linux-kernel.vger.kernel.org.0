Hi Lee

Could you help clarify whether or not this patch is trying to do
something odd/wrong?

I might be misunderstanding Andy (probably is), but the discussion
revolves around the changes I propose where I change the serial8250
driver to use platform_get_resource() in favour of
request_mem_region()/release_mem_region().

In my understanding, use of platform_get_resource() is the right thing
to do in order to integrate properly with with MFD drivers that splits a
common memory resource in mfd_add_device() using the mem_base argument.

Discussion follows:

Sorry, I am not sure what you mean by that.

In drivers/mfd/mfd-core.c:mfd_add_device() :

        for (r = 0; r < cell->num_resources; r++) {
                res[r].name = cell->resources[r].name;
                res[r].flags = cell->resources[r].flags;

                /* Find out base to use */
                if ((cell->resources[r].flags & IORESOURCE_MEM) && mem_base) {
                        res[r].parent = mem_base;
                        res[r].start = mem_base->start +
                                cell->resources[r].start;
                        res[r].end = mem_base->start +
                                cell->resources[r].end;
                } else if (cell->resources[r].flags & IORESOURCE_IRQ) {
                        if (domain) {
                                /* Unable to create mappings for IRQ ranges. */
                                WARN_ON(cell->resources[r].start !=
                                        cell->resources[r].end);
                                res[r].start = res[r].end = irq_create_mapping(
                                        domain, cell->resources[r].start);
                        } else {
                                res[r].start = irq_base +
                                        cell->resources[r].start;
                                res[r].end   = irq_base +
                                        cell->resources[r].end;
                        }
                } else {
                        res[r].parent = cell->resources[r].parent;
                        res[r].start = cell->resources[r].start;
                        res[r].end   = cell->resources[r].end;
                }

                if (!cell->ignore_resource_conflicts) {
                        if (has_acpi_companion(&pdev->dev)) {
                                ret = acpi_check_resource_conflict(&res[r]);
                                if (ret)
                                        goto fail_alias;
                        }
                }
        }

        ret = platform_device_add_resources(pdev, res, cell->num_resources);

This creates the child resources.  Whether we call that requesting the
resources or not, is a matter of word.  But it is what it is.  When it
is done, you cannot use request_mem_region() for those memory resources,
they are now locked/exclusive for the mfd parent *and* for the
respective mfd child device.

In order to use them, child devices simply use platform_get_resource(),
and everything works nicely.  It works fine for normal (non-mfd)
devices, as they get (requests) the resources from the root resource
(iomem_resource), and works fine for mfd devices as well.  So no changes
are needed for drivers to work with mfd.

Whether you call the thing that mfd_add_device() does for "request
resources" or just "pass them to children" is a matter of words.  The
mfd (parent) has a resource which it cuts up into slices for its
children, and these slices are passed to the child devices.  The drivers
for these child devices must then pickup the resource(s) using
platform_get_resource().  At no point is any "request_*" function
called.

Looking at in another way.

The request_mem_region() macro call __request_resource(), which which
simply creates a new 'struct resource' in the iomem_resource resource.

In mfd_add_device(), almost the same happens.  A new 'struct resource'
is created in the mem_base resource.

In both cases, a 'struct resource' is created, representing exclusive
access to the resource.  And like it or not, this is something that MFD
already *do*, and I think it is way out of scope of this patch to change
that.

I just try to make serial8250 driver work nicely in that (mfd) context,
without changing how mfd is working.
