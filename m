Ouch. We certainly can't remove the warning untill we deal with that
somehow, then.

I agree; I think we need logic to check the ID register fields against
their EXACT, {LOWER,HIGHER}_SAFE, etc rules regardless of whether we
have an associated cap. That can then abort a late onlining of a CPU
which violates those rules w.r.t. the finalised system value.

I suspect that we may want to split the notion of
safe-for-{user,kernel-guest} in the feature tables, as if nothing else
it will force us to consider those cases separately when adding new
stuff.

Thanks,
Mark.
