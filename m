I was speaking specifically of the of_find_device_by_node() optimization.
I did not chase any further back in the call chain to see how that would
impact anything else.  My comments stand, whether this patch is meant
to optimize deferred probe optimization or to optimize something else.

Struct device_node is the nodes of the in kernel devicetree data.  This
patch adds a field to every single node of the devicetree.

The patch series is also adding a new property, of varying size, to
some nodes.  This also results in additional memory usage by
devicetree. 

Arguing that a more complex system is likely to have more memory is
likely true, but beside the point.  Minimizing devicetree memory
used on less complex systems is also one of our goals.

Hand waving about O(n) and O(1) and O(n2) is not sufficient.  We require
actual measurements that show O(n2) (when the existing algorithm is such)
is a performance problem and that the proposed change to the algorithm
results in a specific change in the performance.

The devicetree maintainers have decided that memory use is important and
to be minimized, and the burden of proof that performance is an issue
lies on the submitter of a patch that improves performance at the cost
of memory.

Most devicetree boot time cpu overhead only affects the boot event.
Added memory use persists for the entire booted lifetime of the system.

That is not to say that we never increase memory use to improve boot
performance.  We have done so when the measured performance issue and
measured performance improvement justified the change.
