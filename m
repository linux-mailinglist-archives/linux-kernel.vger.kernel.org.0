To be more clear, this patch abstracts the SCMI transport so that mailbox
can be one of the transport. The plan is to add SMC/HVC, SMC/HVC over SPCI,
vitio based transport as alternative to mailbox. These are neither added
as mailbox driver nor transport layer between SCMI and Mailbox. E.g.:
we either use Peng's SMC based mailbox driver as is or add a new transport
independent of mailbox framework here as SCMI transport.
