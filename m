Thanks, from experience working with these semantics in userspace, I agree that 
this design makes it easier to configure the protections in a way that is 
meaningful.

Just as an off-topic aside, although I'm sure you already have it in mind, we 
should definitely make sure to clearly point this out to those in the container 
management tooling space who are in the process of moving to support/default to 
v2. For example, I wonder about CoreOS' systemwide strategy around memory 
management and whether it can benefit from this.
