But the special builds you are doing for Linux firmware have a clm_blob
too, the only difference is that it is embedded. If it is possible to
embed a generic version of the clm_blob, then why not provide separate
a generic version of the separate clm_blob files, so that those can be
used together with build which you release regularly as part of your
SDK ?

This way you do not need to do special builds for linux-firmware,
which seems to be the main bottleneck for having up2date Cypress
firmware files inside linux-firmware.

> also clm_blob download is not supported in kernels prior to 4.15 so those files won't work with older kernels.

That is a valid concern, I'm not sure what the rules for linux-firmware
are with regards to this. OTOH those are quite old kernels and if we
must choice between having recent firmware for modern kernels or old
kernel compatibility I guess the preference would be to have recent
firmware. Likely devices using such old kernels are not updating their
version of linux-firmware anyways.

Ok.
