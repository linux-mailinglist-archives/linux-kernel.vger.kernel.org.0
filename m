Yup. We need to ensure that if a thread sees a populated shadow PTE, the
corresponding shadow memory has been zeroed. Thus, we need to ensure
that the zeroing is observed by other CPUs before we update the PTE.

We're relying on the absence of a TLB entry preventing another CPU from
loading the corresponding shadow shadow memory until its PTE has been
populated (after the zeroing is visible). Consequently there is no
barrier on the other side, and just a control-dependency (which would be
insufficient on its own).

There is a potential problem here, as Will Deacon wrote up at:

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20190827131818.14724-1-will@kernel.org/

... in the section starting:

| *** Other architecture maintainers -- start here! ***

... whereby the CPU can spuriously fault on an access after observing a
valid PTE.

For arm64 we handle the spurious fault, and it looks like x86 would need
something like its vmalloc_fault() applying to the shadow region to
cater for this.

Thanks,
Mark.
