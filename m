Uh, this statement does not make sense. The read barrier is not
needed here. Instead the readers need it.

Well, we might need a write barrier before d->id manipulation.
It should be in numlist_pop() after successfully updating nl->tail_id.
It will allow readers to detect that the desriptor is being reused
(not in valid tail_id..head_id range) before we start manipulating it.

This still makes sense. I would move the write barrier from
prb_reserve() here.


Sigh, I have to admit that I am not familiar with the _acquire(),
_release(), and _relaxed() variants of the atomic operations.

They probably make it easier to implement some locking API.
I am not sure how to use it here. This code implements a complex
interlock between several variables. I mean that several variables
lock each other in a cycle, like a state machine? In each case,
it is not a simple locking where we check state of a single
variable.
