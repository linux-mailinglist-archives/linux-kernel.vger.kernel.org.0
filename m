Subject: [PATCH 63/69] libperf: Centralize map refcnt setting

From: Jiri Olsa <jolsa@kernel.org>

Currently when a new map is mmapped we set its refcnt to 2 in the
perf_evlist_mmap_ops::mmap callback.

Every mmap gets its refcnt set to 2 when it's first mmaped:

  - 1 for the current user, which will be taken out by a call to
    perf_evlist__munmap_filtered(), where we find out there's
    no more data comming from kernel to this mmap.

  - 1 for the drain code where in perf_mmap__consume() the mmap
    is released if it is empty.

Move this common setup into libperf's generic code before the mmap
callback is called.
