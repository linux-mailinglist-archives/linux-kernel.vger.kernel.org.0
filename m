This is the IS_ENABLED part.

Presumably if it's enabled then it will be providing XO at some point in
the future. I'm not suggesting the probe defer logic is removed, just
that we don't get into a state where clk tree has merged all the patches
for clk driver side and that then relies on DT to provide the clk but it
doesn't do that.

So the idea is to check if RPM is compiled in and also check the GCC DT
node for the clocks property having the xo clk there. Then we assume
that we have the clk patches in place for the RPM clk driver to provide
that clk and we skip inserting the fake clk that RPM is going to
provide.

This is also a "general" solution to GCC not depending on or selecting
the RPM clk driver. It may be better to just have a select statement in
GCC Kconfig so that we can't enable the GCC driver without also enabling
the RPM driver if it's an essential dependency to the clk tree working.
But if we do this design then we can make the clk tree keep working
regardless of RPM being there or not, which may be a good thing.
