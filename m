Yes, GNU as is inconsistent here.  While fixing
https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2020-02/msg00243.html , I noticed
that the rule is quite complex. There are definitely lots of places to
improve.  clang 10 emits relocations consistently.

   call	foo              # R_X86_64_PLT32
   leaq	foo(%rip), %rax  # R_X86_64_PC32
   jmp	foo              # R_X86_64_PLT32

We can teach the assembler to not emit relocations referencing STV_HIDDEN or
STV_INTERNAL symbols, but I favor the simpler rule that only relocations
referencing STB_LOCAL non-STT_GNU_IFUNC symbols defined in the same section are resolved.
Leave the visibility jobs to the linker.

If we ever teach GNU objcopy or llvm-objcopt an option to set
visibility, resolving relocations may disallow such use cases.

Unfortunately gcc>=5 x86 and GNU ld>=2.26 x86 are in a bad status
regarding STV_PROTECTED (https://reviews.llvm.org/D72197#1866384).
(Now I retest it, I think I may add a special -no-integrated-as rule to
clang just to work around GNU ld x86>=2.26.)

The GCC approach costs more bytes. foo.localalias is not prefixed by .L,
thus it wastes sizeof(Elf*_Sym) bytes for each such function.

      5: 0000000000401000     7 FUNC    LOCAL  DEFAULT    1 foo.localalias

Call/jump relocations on ARM and MIPS treat STT_FUNC differently.
If eventually we use the clang optimization for ARM and MIPS, we
probably should consider changing `.Lfoo$local:` to `.set .Lfoo$local, foo`
The assembler is quite complex. I need to investigate more into LLVM MC.

R_ARM_CALL/R_ARM_THM_CALL can be used against STT_NOTYPE symbols.
That disables interwork thunks (https://reviews.llvm.org/D73542).
If objtool is used by ARM and such disabling semantic is ever needed,
the rule should be loosened to allow STT_NOTYPE.
