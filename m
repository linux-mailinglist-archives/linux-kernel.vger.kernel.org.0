Well, yes, I too was/am sceptical, but it was tglx who twisted my arm
and said the i2c people were right and rt_mutex is/should-be a generic
usable interface.

This then resulted in the futex specific interface and lockdep support
for rt_mutex:

  5293c2efda37 ("futex,rt_mutex: Provide futex specific rt_mutex API")
  f5694788ad8d ("rt_mutex: Add lockdep annotations")

All good, just trying to make sense of things :-)

So this part actually makes rt_mutex less special and is good.

And am I right in thinking that that, again, is specific to the
sleeping-spinlocks from PREEMPT_RT? Is there really nothing else that
identifies those more specifically? It's been a while since I looked at
them.

Also, I suppose it would be really good to put that in a comment.
