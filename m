Vinod, your distinction between subsystem and driver is quite arbitrary 
and borderline unreasonable. I would counter that the Intel parts have 
actually nothing to do in this drivers/soundwire directory and should be 
moved to the SOF tree if you push your own logic one step. There already 
known variations on capabilities and number of links which would be 
better handled in sound/soc/sof/intel, just like SoundWire slaves are 
expected to be in sound/soc/codecs.

Besides this fixes *newlines*...

I will send an update but I am not happy about the directions here.
