I won't pretend to know what's going on, so I'll preface this by
labeling it all as "flailing", but:

I wonder if there's some way the interrupt can get delayed between
XHCI snapping the torn value and it finding its way into the IRR. For
instance, if xhci read this value at the start of their interrupt
moderation timer period, that would be awful (I hope they don't do
this). One test patch would be to carve out 8 vectors reserved for
xhci on all cpus. Whenever you change the affinity, the assigned
vector is always reserved_base + cpu_number. That lets you exercise
the affinity switching code, but in a controlled manner where torn
interrupts could be easily seen (ie hey I got an interrupt on cpu 4's
vector but I'm cpu 2). I might struggle to write such a change, but in
theory it's doable.

Actually the slightly easier experiment might be to reserve a single
vector for xhci on all cores. We'd strongly expect the problem to go
away, since now there's no more torn writes since the vector is always
the same. If it somehow didn't go away, you'd know there's more to the
story.

I was alternately trying to build a theory in my head about the write
somehow being posted and getting out of order, but I don't think that
can happen.

Another experiment would be to try my old patch in [1]. I'm not
advocating for this patch as a solution, Thomas and Bjorn have
convinced me that it will break the rest of the world. But your PCI
device 0xa3af seems to be Comet Lake. I was also on Comet Lake. So I'd
expect to at least see it mask your problem. Again, if it didn't, that
might be an interesting datapoint.
