Yes, it is dubious. IMHO, the 5 error codes make it even harder to
see what happens in which case.

The code really need simplification. I would prefer to take the risk
and reduce the amount of added conditions as much as possible.
I have an idea, see below.

Please, replace this with int, where:

   + con_matched -> 0
   + con_matched_preferred -> 0 and make "has_preferred" global variable
   + con_braile -> 0		later check for CON_BRL flag
   + con_failed -> -EFAULT
   + con_no_match -> -ENOENT

Some of the comments describe what is obvious. I would simplify
it the following way:

	/* Prefer command line over platform specific defaults. */
	err = try_match_new_console(newcon, true);
	if (err = -ENOENT)
		err = try_match_new_console(newcon, false);

	/* printk() messages are not printed to Braille consoles. */
	if (err || console->flags | CON_BRL)
		return;


Finally, please split the change into two patches:

1st patch will "just" introduce try_match_new_console(console) and
 use it the following way:

	err = try_match_new_console(newcon);

	/* printk() messages are not printed to the Braille console. */
	if (err || console->flags | CON_BRL)
		return;

2nd patch will add the user_specified logic.

This way bisection will distinguish regressions caused
by the refactoring and by the changed search order.

Best Regards,
Petr

PS: I have vacation between December 23 and January 1. I believe
that v3 will be ready for merging. Anyway, I will not push it
into linux-next before I am back from vacation. I would like
to stay off the computer and do not want to eventually break
linux-next for too long.
