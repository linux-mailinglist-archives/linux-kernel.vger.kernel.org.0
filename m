I have a few minor nitpicks but otherwise the series looks good to me.
I'm perfectly happy to see the individual patches unless you want to
squash them into one big patch. I can review the conversions either way.

Did you need me to apply any patches here? Or can I assume you'll resend
with a pull request so it can be merged into clk-next?

BTW, did you have to update any DT bindings or documentation? I didn't
see anything, so I'm a little surprised that all that stuff was already
in place.
