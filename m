Awesome.  I'm glad it was something simple.

Short version, yes.  Long version:

I still have that hack in my tree and haven't come back to formulating
a proper fix yet.  Feel free to run with it.

Thinking about it briefly, we could do two things.  We could fake a
hardware counter by just increment an int every time the vblank irq is
processed, but that seems clunky.  Otherwise, we could force a
fallback onto the timestamp solution, which seems less invasive.

In theory, we could service multiple displays, with different
properties (ie a combination of command and video mode).  The hack
then, is not good, because it would break video mode (at-least we
wouldn't be using the register when we could).  It would be great if
the use of the hardware register could be done per display.

Luckily, it looks like someone just made that possible -
