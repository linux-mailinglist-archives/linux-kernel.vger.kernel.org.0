This patch series moves Tegra PMC clocks from clock driver to pmc driver
along with the device trees changes and audio driver which uses one of
the pmc clock for audio mclk.

Tegra PMC has clk_out_1, clk_out_2, clk_out_3 and blink controls which
are currently registered by Tegra clock driver using clk_regiser_mux and
clk_register_gate which performs direct Tegra PMC register access.

When Tegra PMC is in secure mode, any access from non-secure world will
not go through.

This patch series adds these Tegra PMC clocks and blink controls to Tegra
PMC driver with PMC as clock provider and removes them from Tegra clock
driver.

PMC clock clk_out_1 is dedicated for audio mclk from Tegra30 thru Tegra210
and clock driver does inital parent configuration for it and enables them.
But this clock should be taken care by audio driver as there is no need
to have this clock pre enabled.

So, this series also includes patch that updates ASoC driver to take
care of parent configuration for mclk if device tree don't specify
initial parent configuration using assigned-clock-parents.

DTs are also updated to use clk_out_1 as audio mclk rather than extern1.

This series also includes a patch for mclk fallback to extern1 when
retrieving mclk fails to have this backward compatible of new DT with
old kernels.

[v5]:	Changes between v4 and v5 are
	- v4 feedback
	- updated dt-binding pmc YAML schema with more description on power
	  gate nodes and pad configuration state nodes.
	- update tegra_asoc_utils_set_rate to disable audio mclk only if
	  its in enable state.

[v4]:	Changes between v3 and v4 are
	- v3 Feedback
	- Updated clocks clk_m_div2 and clk_m_div4 as osc_div2 and osc_div4.
	  Tegra don't have clk_m_div2, clk_m_div4 and they should actually
	  be osc_div2 and osc_div4 clocks from osc pads.
	- Fixed PMC clock parents to use osc, osc_div2, osc_div4.
	- Register each PMC clock as single clock rather than separate
	  mux and gate clocks.
	- Update ASoC utils to use resource managed APIs rather than
	  using clk_get and clk_put.
	- Updated device tree and ASoC driver to use clk_out_1 instead of
	  clk_out_1_mux as PMC clocks are registered as single clock.
	- Update clock driver init_table to not enable audio related clocks
	  as ASoC utils will do audio clock enables.

[v3]:	Changes between v2 and v3 are
	- Removes set parent of clk_out_1_mux to extern1 and enabling
	  extern1 from the clock driver.
	- Doesn't enable clk_out_1 and blink by default in pmc driver
	- Updates ASoC driver to take care of audio mclk parent
	  configuration incase if device tree don't specify assigned
	  clock parent properties and enables mclk using both clk_out_1
	  and extern1.
	- updates all device trees using extern1 as mclk in sound node
	  to use clk_out_1 from pmc.
	- patch for YAML format pmc dt-binding
	- Includes v2 feedback

[v2]:	Changes between v1 and v2 are
	- v2 includes patches for adding clk_out_1, clk_out_2, clk_out_3,
	  blink controls to Tegra PMC driver and removing clk-tegra-pmc.
	- feedback related to pmc clocks in Tegra PMC driver from v1
	- Removed patches for WB0 PLLM overrides and PLLE IDDQ PMC programming
	  by the clock driver using helper functions from Tegra PMC.

 	  Note:
	  To use helper functions from PMC driver, PMC early init need to
	  happen prior to using helper functions and these helper functions are
	  for PLLM Override and PLLE IDDQ programming in PMC during PLLM/PLLE
	  clock registration which happen in clock_init prior to Tegra PMC
	  probe.
	  Moving PLLM/PLLE clocks registration to happen after Tegra PMC
	  impacts other clocks EMC, MC and corresponding tegra_emc_init and
	  tegra_mc_init.
	  This implementation of configuring PMC registers thru helper
	  functions in clock driver needs proper changes across PMC, Clock,
	  EMC and MC inits to have it work across all Tegra platforms.

	  Currently PLLM Override is not enabled in the bootloader so proper
	  patches for this fix will be taken care separately.

[v1]:	v1 includes patches for below fixes.
	- adding clk_out_1, clk_out_2, clk_out_3, blink controls to Tegra PMC
	  driver and removing clk-tegra-pmc.
	- updated clock provider from tegra_car to pmc in the device tree
	  tegra210-smaug.dts that uses clk_out_2.
	- Added helper functions in PMC driver for WB0 PLLM overrides and PLLE
	  IDDQ programming to use by clock driver and updated clock driver to
	  use these helper functions and removed direct PMC access from clock
	  driver and all pmc base address references in clock driver.
