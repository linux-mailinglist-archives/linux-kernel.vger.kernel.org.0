Uh, so the index would be encoded with least-significant bit first,
starting from bit55 downwards? Clever idea, but I think this needs a
macro (or at least a comment). Not sure there's a ready-made bitmask
mirror function for this stuff, works case we can hand-code it and
extend every time we need one more bit encoded. Something like:

MIRROR_U32((u & (BIT(0)) << 31 | (u & BIT(1) << 30 | ...)

And then shift that to the correct place. Probably want an

ARM_MODIFIER_ENCODE(space_idx, flags) macro which assembles everything.

Yeah that's what I meant. Also better to explicitly reserve this, i.e.

#define ARM_FBC_MODIFIER_SPACE 0
#define ARM_MISC_MODIFIER_SPACE 1

and then encode with the mirror trickery.

:-) I mean full code exists in panfrost/lima, so this won't change
anything really ...
