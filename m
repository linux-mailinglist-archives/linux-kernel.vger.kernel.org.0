The way we model the ww-mutex stuff is that the acquire-ctx is treated
as a lockdep lock, and then we require that one if you take two or
more ww-mutexes (the nested locking stuff lockdep complains about).

So you already hold a ww-mutex while trying to get a 2nd one, without
holding a ww-mutex acquire ctx ticket. Could be a ww-mutex you forgot
to unlock somewhere.
