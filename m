Ah, bootconfig syntax interprets the "," as a delimiter of array elements.
So those must be quoted by "" (or '') as below.

	earlyprintk="ttyS0,115200"
	console="ttyS0,115200"

Oops, I forgot to support double parameters.

Yes, I think we can embed bootconfig into the kernel image while
building it as a text data. I think appending the bootconfig to kernel
image will be hard because some kernel image will be compressed and self-
extracted on memory. It might break original data.

Thanks for the good information! I'll check it.

Yes, that is my mistake. Since the legacy command line doesn't support
array, it should be expanded. If you write it correctly, I will ensure
it to
console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty0

For the above example, I can fix it. I also would not like to change the
behaviors. Could you share your concerning items if you have more?

Agreed, that's confusing message.

Thank you very much for your opinion and information!
That's very helpful to me.

Thank you,
