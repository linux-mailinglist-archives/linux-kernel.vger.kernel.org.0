Right, we have this dualism to deal with and current mainline behaviour
is somehow in the middle.

BTW, the FB requirement is the same we have in Android.
We want some CFS tasks to have very small latency and a low chance
to be preempted by the wake-up of less-important "background" tasks.

I'm not totally against the usage of a signed range, but I'm thinking
that since we are introducing a new (non POSIX) concept we can get the
chance to make it more human friendly.

Give the two extremes above, would not be much simpler and intuitive to
have 0 implementing the FB/Android (no latency) case and 1024 the
(max latency) Oracle case?

Moreover, we will never match completely the nice semantic, give that
a 1 nice unit has a proper math meaning, isn't something like 10% CPU
usage change for each step?

For latency-nice instead we will likely base our biasing strategies on
some predefined (maybe system-wide configurable) const thresholds.

Could changing the name to "latency-tolerance" break the tie by marking
its difference wrt prior/nice levels? AFAIR, that was also the original
proposal [1] by PaulT during the OSPM discussion.

Best,
Patrick
