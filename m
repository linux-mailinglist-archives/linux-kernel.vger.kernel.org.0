The patch [1] looks good to me.  And yes, if the structure pointed to by
the second argument of rcu_assign_pointer() is already visible to readers,
it is OK to instead use RCU_INIT_POINTER().  Yes, this loses ordering.
But weren't these simple assignments before RCU got involved?

As a very rough rule of thumb, LWSYNC is about twice as fast as SYNC.
(Depends on workload, exact details of the hardware, timing, phase of
the moon, you name it.)  So removing the LWSYNC is likely to provide
measureable benefit, but I must defer to the powerpc maintainers.
To that end, I added Michael on CC.

							Thanx, Paul
