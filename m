Adding an explicit rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() pair to the various
spinlock primitives for -rt seems quite sensible to me.  My guess is
that non-rt CONFIG_PREEMPT=y uses in mainline might not like the extra
overhead.

For the trylock primitives, would it make more sense to do the
rcu_read_lock() only after successful acquisition, or to do the
rcu_read_lock() to begin with and then do rcu_read_unlock() upon failure?
I would guess the latter, but don't feel strongly about it.

							Thanx, Paul
