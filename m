Thanks for all the hints Alan.

I think I figured it out, the below patch seems to fix it for me. Looking
at other drivers resume functions it seems we're missing the
pm_runtime_disable()->set_active()->enable() dance. Doing that fixes the
warning and the dev_err() in driver/base/power.

I don't see xhci-plat.c doing that, I wonder if it needs it too.

I'm not well versed about the details and the rules here. So my fix could be
a hack, though it does seem the right thing to do.

I wonder why the power core doesn't handle this transparently..

Requested dmesg is attached too.
