Hi Shannon,

What problem does this solve?

KVM has some funny requirements that aren't normal for a module. On v8.0 hardware it must
have an idmap. Modules don't usually expect their code to be physically contiguous, but
KVM does. KVM influences they way some of the irqchip stuff is set up during early boot
(EOI mode ... not that I understand it).

(I think KVM-as-a-module on x86 is an artifact of how it was developed)

We still need to support !VHE systems, and we need to do it with a single image.

Making this work for the single-Image on v8.0 is going to be a tremendous amount of work.
What is the payoff?


Thanks,
