With ion, we are making sure there are *standard* heaps that Android should
be able to rely on to exist in all kernels [1]. That list is based on what
default heaps ion had out-of-tree.

As of today, even from those that ion had, Android vendor independent code only
relies on 'system heap' and 'cma/dma heaps' so, can safely ignore the carveout
and other ion heaps.

system heap is really the one that is realistically 'hardware independent',
so that can be in kernel. The cma heaps and their existence is optional, so
it will be nice to be able to load them as modules.
