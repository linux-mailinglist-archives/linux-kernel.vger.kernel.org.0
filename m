The problem is that there is no current maping of a module to respective
kconfig symbol.

Folks wanting to slim down their kernel build, and users of backports.

Without a mapping there is no clean way to let you slim down your kernel
using a distro kernel as a base, enabling only those things you really
need.

Historically those interested would just have streamline_config.pl at
their disposal, but it isn't perfect. Although Cristina extended
streamline_config.pl, the proper approach here would be to see if the
heuristics in streamline_config.pl which she made use of to map a config
symbol for a module could be written in C. The safe heuristic used is
that for modules where there was only one kconfig symbol associated,
we'd be certain that kconfig symbol was the one needed for that module.

A side benefit is also that by having a modinfo section for the kconfib
symbol we'd have access to it via sysfs, an example is
/sys/module/e1000/section/kconfig_symb, and then streamline_config.pl
could be simplified further by not having to parse Makefiles in perl.
The reason for using a modinfo section also is you could get the
information about configs needed for modules without requiring your
kernel sources, and this information then also becomes available to
augment udevadm for its own hardware db info.

Another set of users of this would be users of backports. For instance
users on distro kernels but their current kernel lacks updated drivers
for one of your devices, and you want to use a backports release, but
just want to build / only the drivers you really need for the release.
Backports then could easily scrape for the sysfs attribute / udevadm db
to let you build and install only the modules you need.

Long term users are developers working on trying to clear up kconfig
semantics. Having a clear indicator in our tree about modules where a
direct mapping was not possible (say with a KBUILD_KCONF definition in
their Makefiles to clarify which config symbol enables it) gives us an
idea of kconfig entries which may be contrived and could use some
clarifications.
