I will split to 4 changes, and send each one to its respective mailing lists and maintainer/reviewer.

yes, this is already taken care.

All the calls from driver will go through as it is and won't fail even without calling new APIs.
So they are already optional.

The comment in rpmh_start_transaction() is already saying if client "choose" to invoke this
then this must be ended by calling rpmh_end_transaction(). if client don't invoke
rpmh_start_transaction() in the first place then everything is expected work as if no change.

No, currently also in driver no one is calling rpmh_flush().

so nothing breaks with series and no point in adding changes to flush right away and then remove them in same series.

when the clients starts invoking new APIs, rpmh_flush() will start getting invoked for the first time in driver.

We don't need to end up syncing up with all other maintainers. the calls are already optional.

These new changes (as they be split in to 4) can go in any order in various maintainer's trees,
once this series goes in rpmh driver.
