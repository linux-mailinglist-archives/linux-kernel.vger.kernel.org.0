After figuring how to use cgroup2 (systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 boot
parameter helped tremendously), and testing similar scenarios, it indeed
seems to have a much saner behavior than cgroup1.

Considering that the allowed cpu mask is weird wrt cgroup1 and cpu hotplug,
and that cgroup2 allows thread-level granularity, it does not make much sense
to prevent the pin_on_cpu() system call I am working on from pinning
on cpus which are not present in the allowed mask.

I'm currently investigating approaches that would detect situations
where a thread is pinned onto a CPU which is not part of its allowed
mask, and set the task prio at MAX_PRIO-1 (the lowest fair priority
possible) in those cases.

The basic idea is to allow applications to pin to every possible cpu, but
not allow them to use this to consume a lot of cpu time on CPUs they
are not allowed to run.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
