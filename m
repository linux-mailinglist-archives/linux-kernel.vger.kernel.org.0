Hi Will,

Thanks your reply firstly.

There may be some misunderstanding if I don't describe it correctly. From
the implementation of perf-mem on x86, it needs:
a. mem-stores PMU events;
b. mem-loads/load-latency from PEBS;

If arm64 plans to support perf-mem, we need to support mem-stores and
mem-loads/load-latency, and we can derive the latter from SPE.

An excellent question, I don't check the perf-mem carefully. Just from my
understanding, it needs the mentioned events and PEBS sampled data that is
filtered by desired latency for loads event.

Got it and I have used SPE on Huawei Kunpeng 920 SoC.

Ok, If I follow it right, perf record -c XXX to define the period for SPE.

Jiri, can you give some implementations of perf-mem on mem-stores and
PEBS please?

We can get load-latency from SPE now and want to throw the thoughts whether
we should do perf-mem on arm64.
