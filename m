The challenge is that in some cases, there *is* no good solution.  If
you don't have decent hardware support, there's not a whole lot you
can do as a systems integrator or the distro.  Enabling this feature
will be a support nightmare, so I predict that darned few
distributions will be to enable it.

At the very least, we need to document the reality as it exists today,
which is that systems with systemd and Openwrt (and its derivitives),
*will* hang if this option is selected.  And we need to make sure that
zero-day testing with randconfig doesn't try to select this option
(hiding it behind CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL should do the trick), since we
won't want to get spammed by the zero-day test bot.  That's how much
this option is guaranteed to break systems --- our continuous
integration testing systems are guaranteed to trip against it.
