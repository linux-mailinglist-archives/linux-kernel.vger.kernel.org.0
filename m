Having to run 'make dt_binding_check' on everything.  I guess maybe if
the tree stays clean it won't be too bad and it wasn't too bad against
the current linux-next, but I can imagine that every time I want to
run this I'll run into a pile of warnings / errors in other people's
files.  Then I need to figure out what to ignore / workaround.  If
something fails badly (like intel-gw-pcie.yaml) I'll have to realize
that I should just delete that file to get the rest of the run to
report errors that are relevant to me.

This'll probably be worse because most maintainer trees are based on
"-rc1" and at least in the past I've found that "-rc1" tends to have
lots of problems.  Each maintainer then fixes the problems relative to
their own subsystem, but it's not a wonderful thing to rely on.

This would be helpful.  ...or some way to easily make really bad
failures non-fatal.  Then I can maybe just diff the results before my
patch and after and that'll give me a hint of what I've fixed / made
worse.

At this point I'm going to say that we're better off than we were, but
I'll try to keep this in mind for future patches.
