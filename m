I'll make a note about this, since we can probably benefit from some
more comments about the assumptions/invariants the fastpath uses.

The build time configuration is because we need to have an assembly
implementation of the restartable sequence (example: x86_64
[https://github.com/google/tcmalloc/blob/master/tcmalloc/internal/percpu_rseq_x86_64.S]),
although I've been moving these to inline assembly recently.

If we have build time support for the code path, we'll try to invoke
the rseq() call and see if registration succeeds:
https://github.com/google/tcmalloc/blob/master/tcmalloc/internal/percpu.cc#L85-L107

As far as ARM support goes for TCMalloc's per-CPU/rseq path, I haven't
had the bandwidth to write an assembly implementation (although I'd
welcome one).

Thanks,
