Hi Stephen,

Thanks a lot for taking time out to review and providing feedback. I have
tried to address all your review concerns except few below mentioned points
where i need more clarification.

Fixed rate clks may need enable/disable clk ops. That's the only reason
for making it visible to clock driver.

These two set_clk_val's can not be combined because they have different
non-contiguous bitmaps (shifts) and lgm_set_clk_val() is defined to handle
only one shift. However, i have addressed your other comment i.e. inline it
and hold spinlock across the function during read/modify/write.

We needed dev pointers just for dev_err() in clk_ops when they are called
back from core. I have now removed dev_err() calls from the driver clk_ops
as i believe the error info was not that useful. And so i have removed dev
pointers from above structures.

However, i think it would be good to have a clk_hw API which returns dev
pointer for drivers. Presently, dev pointer is stored inside clk_hw->clk_core
and clk_core is private to core, inaccessible from clk drivers.

It is actually used.

I have changed it to new way i.e. by using fw_name. Only exception is where we
use clk API's clk_hw_register_fixed_rate() & clk_hw_register_fixed_factor().
In these API's, i am, for now, passing parent_data[0].name as parent_name.

To avoid the conflict with clk_flags used across common struct clk
defined in clk-provider.h. Bits 0~13 are already used there. So
we keep some gap and start with 16 :). We don't maintain a separate
pure driver only flags bitmask as that would make it confusing.

GATE_CLK_HW & GATE_CLK_SW is no longer needed for this SoC. So i have
removed it. MUX_CLK_SW is still needed. It is more of a workaround for
one particular combophy module for which get_parent/set_parent does not
apply (no hardware translation to select/query input clk source).
However, other MUX clks in this clk group have valid hardware translation
for parent clock sources.

Yes, but i am missing your point. Can you please elaborate more ?

Agree. We use CONFIG_SMP with no PREEMPT_RT. So i think it is same.
Have switched to normal spinlocks.
