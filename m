But they are, aren't they? See what we do in irq_set_affinity:

+		atomic_inc(per_cpu_ptr(&cpu_lpi_count, cpu));
+		atomic_dec(per_cpu_ptr(&cpu_lpi_count,
+				       its_dev->event_map.col_map[id]));

We don't try to "rebalance" anything based on that though, not that
I think we should.

It shouldn't be hard to do, and most of the existing code could be
moved to the generic level. As for the value, I'm not convinced
either. For example D05 uses the MBIGEN as an intermediate interrupt
controller, so MSIs are from the PoV of MBIGEN, and not the SAS device
attached to it. Not the best design...

OK, that's encouraging.

Looks good.

Is this interrupt screaming to the point where it prevents the 
completion
thread from making forward progress? What if you don't use threaded
interrupts?

OK. Please keep me posted. If the result is overall positive, I'll
push this into -next for some soaking.

Thanks,
