ev/sgx/enclave, which I see as a security benefit because it only affects t=
he enclave but not the whole process hosting it.

So the permission would be like FILE__EXECMOD on the source enclave
page, because it would be mapped MAP_ANONYMOUS, PROT_WRITE?
MAP_SHARED, PROT_WRITE isn't going to work because that means you can
modify the file.

I'm starting to think that looking at the source VMA permission bits
or source PTE permission bits is putting a bit too much policy into
the driver as opposed to the LSM.  How about delegating the whole
thing to an LSM hook?  The EADD operation would invoke a new hook,
something like:

int security_enclave_load_bytes(void *source_addr, struct
vm_area_struct *source_vma, loff_t source_offset, unsigned int
maxperm);

Then you don't have to muck with mapping anything PROT_EXEC.  Instead
you load from a mapping of a file and the LSM applies whatever policy
it feels appropriate.  If the first pass gets something wrong, the
application or library authors can take it up with the SELinux folks
without breaking the whole ABI :)

(I'm proposing passing in the source_vma because this hook would be
called with mmap_sem held for read to avoid a TOCTOU race.)

If we go this route, the only substantial change to the existing
driver that's needed for an initial upstream merge is the maxperm
mechanism and whatever hopefully minimal API changes are needed to
allow users to conveniently set up the mappings.  And we don't need to
worry about how to hack around mprotect() calling into the LSM,
because the LSM will actually be aware of SGX and can just do the
right thing.
