I kept the naming because there is the remote possibility that NUMA
balancing will deviate in some fashion. Right now, it's harmless.

I didn't merge that part of the first version of my series. I was
waiting to see how the implementation for allowing a small degree of
imbalance looks like. If it's entirely confined in adjust_numa_balance
then I'll create the common helper at the same time. For now, I left the
possibility open that numa_classify would use something different than
group_is_overloaded or group_has_capacity even if I find that hard to
imagine at the moment.

Yikes, no I'd rather not do that. Basically all I did before was create
a common helper like __lb_has_capacity that only took basic types as
parameters. group_has_capacity and numa_has_capacity were simple wrappers
that read the correct fields from their respective stats structures.
