You say that switching of CPU feature bits is problematic, but adding
new features should result only in a warning ("x86/CPU: CPU features
have changed after loading microcode, but might not take effect.").

Removing a CPU feature bit could be problematic. Other than HLE being
removed on Haswell (which the kernel shouldn't use anyway), have there
been any other cases?

I ask because we have successfully used late microcode loading on tens
of thousands of hosts. I'm a bit worried to see that there is a push to
remove a feature that we currently rely on.
