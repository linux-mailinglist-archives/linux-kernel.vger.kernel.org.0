AFAICT, there will be more features in the EAX register in the future.
Ok. I will use a feature word for CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=1):EAX.

So can I re-organize word 11 and 12 as follows?

1. Change word 11 to host scattered features.
2. Move the previos features in word 11 and word 12 to word 11:
/*
 * Extended auxiliary flags: Linux defined - For features scattered in various
 * CPUID levels and sub-leaves like CPUID level 7 and sub-leaf 1, etc, word 19.
 */
#define X86_FEATURE_CQM_LLC             (11*32+ 0) /* LLC QoS if 1 */
#define X86_FEATURE_CQM_OCCUP_LLC       (11*32+ 1) /* LLC occupancy monitoring */
#define X86_FEATURE_CQM_MBM_TOTAL       (11*32+ 2) /* LLC Total MBM monitoring */
#define X86_FEATURE_CQM_MBM_LOCAL       (11*32+ 3) /* LLC Local MBM monitoring */

3. Change word 12 to host CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=1):EAX:
/* Intel-defined CPU features, CPUID level 0x7:1 (EAX), word 12 */
#define X86_FEATURE_AVX512_BF16         (12*32+ 0) /* BFLOAT16 instructions */

4. Do other necessary changes to match the new word 11 and word 12.

Thanks.
