Ok, so I took a quick look at the schematic and it is really funky.

The USB3 superspeed data pairs are only going to the USB-3 hub and
only the USB-2 lines are muxed between the TypeC and the HUB, so
in theory superspeed devices could keep working while the TypeC is
in device mode, since their data lines will still be connected,
but I guess the controller in the SoC is switched to device mode
then so this does not work. Likewise Vbus is an all or
nothing thing, either both the TypeC connector + the 2 Type-A
reeptacles get Vusb or none of them get Vusb. Also it is seems to use
the TypeC connector in host-mode together with the A receptacles.
I must say this is a weird design...

Anyways back the code to add a usb role switch notifier. I do
not think that this is a good idea, this is making "core" changes
to deal with a special case. If you are going to use a notfier for
this then IMHO the notifier should be part of the hikey960 usb role
swtich driver and not be in the usb-role-switch class code, since
this is very much a device specific hack.

Regards,

Hans
