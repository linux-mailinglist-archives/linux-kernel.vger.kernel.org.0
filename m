No one has cared about the speed of that call as it has never been on
any "fast path" that I know of.  And it should just be O(N), isn't it
just walking the list of devices in order?

If the "memory subsystem" wants a faster lookup for their objects,
there's nothing stopping you from using your own data structure for the
pointers to the objects if you want.  Just be careful about the lifetime
rules.
