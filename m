Lockless concurrency always makes my head hurt (especially when I try
to consider weakly ordered memory) and I've learned that the only way
I can reason about it and have any belief that I got it right is to
always make sure I access values in a context where things are locked.
:-P

Let's see if I can figure out any actual problem, though...

Certainly the queue_delayed_work() would act as a barrier so you don't
have to worry about the worker not seeing the "= true".

I suppose it's definitely possible that (if the worker is already
running) that our "= true" will get clobbered by an "= false" from a
previous instance of the worker running.  I guess that's unlikely
because we can't get a second IRQ signaled until the "->ack_sdio_irq"
ran and presumably there's enough stuff after the "= false" that one
of them would have a barrier that made sure that the "= false" didn't
affect us in a delayed way.

So I guess we're fine...
