I was mostly referring to the power sequence mentionned in the H6
Datasheet (not the user manual, the smaller one).

And we can't use the compatible for these..

So if we want to have something that works for the H3 too, then I
guess we need to revert the patch that switches the 32kHz clock source
to the external one all the time, and do it only if we have a clock
provided.

If we don't, we would run from the internal oscillator (which would
work for both the H3 and H6 boards you have I guess?) and if we do we
will still use the better, more accurate, clock.

That would change a bit the behaviour of the old DTs again and revert
to the old behaviour we had, but we didn't hear anything the first
time we did, so I wouldn't be overly concerned.

Does that make sense?
Maxime
