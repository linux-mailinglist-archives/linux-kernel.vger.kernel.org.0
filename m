It was a requirement prior to the API rework in v20, i.e. unless someone
was really quick on the draw after the v20 update all existing userspace
implementations mmap() the enclave before ECREATE.   Requiring a valid
enclave VMA for EADD shoudn't be too onerous.

Nope.  My reasoning behind skipping LSM checks is that the LSMs have
already ok'd the source VMAs, similar to how dup_mmap() doesn't redo LSM
checks.

No, EPC pages have 4k granularity.

  The EPC is divided into EPC pages. An EPC page is 4KB in size and always
  aligned on a 4KB boundary

EEXTEND is the only aspect of SGX that works on 256-byte chunks, and that
goofiness is primarily to keep the latency of EEXTEND low enough so that
the instruction doesn't have to be interruptible, a la EINIT.

Requiring extra permissions is good though, right?  My thinking is to make
the EADD "VMA copy" the happy/easy path, while using mprotect() to convert
EPC memory to executable would require PROCESS__EXECMEM (assuming we back
enclaves with anon inodes instead of /dev/sgx/enclave).

Hmm, it can't effectively re-mmap() the enclave as executable since
entering the enclave requires using the correct virtual address range,
i.e. EENTER would fail.  It could, I think, do munmap()->mmap() to change
the permissions.  We could handle that case fairly easily by invoking
security_file_mprotect() in SGX's mmap() hook if any pages have been added
to the enclave, i.e. treat mmap() like mprotect().
