Yes, but I don't see any format specifier to switch to that will hash in a
randomized production environment, but not in a debug or other non-randomized
environment which seems like the ideal default for most debug output.

This doesn't deal with "nokaslr" on the kernel command line.  It also doesn't
seem like something that every callsite should have to opencode, versus having
an appropriate format specifier behaves as I described above (and I still
don't see why that format specifier should not be "%p").
