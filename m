So I wrote a tiny function to test (rather than wrestle with trying
to disassemble the post-alternative patched binary of the running system):

        .globl  feature
        .type   feature, @function
feature:
        .cfi_startproc
       ALTERNATIVE_2 \
               "movl    $1, %eax", \
               "movl    $2, %eax", X86_FEATURE_FSRM, \
               "movl    $3, %eax", X86_FEATURE_ERMS

        ret

This returns "3" ... not what we want. But swapping the ERMS/FSRM order
gets the correct version.

Triple fault is a surprise.  As long as you have ERMS, it shouldn't
hurt to take the FSRM code path.

Does the code that performs the patch use memmove() to copy the alternate
version into place? That could get ugly!

I'm not in the same city as my test machine, so I'm going to defer testing
Linus' patch (with FSRM/ERMS swapped) until I'm near enough to poke it
if it breaks.
