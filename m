Ah, I forgot to explain about this change.  Thank you for let me know.

Overall, ETHP in DAMON-based Operations Schemes RFC v5 shows worse peak
performance gains.

For example, splash2x/fft shows best case speedup with ETHP for both this
version and previous version.  The speedup changed from 19% to 12%.  In case of
splash2x/ocean_ncp, it changed from 18% to only 0.08%.

That said, total performance speedup is improved.  It was 1.83% before, and
2.21% now.  Also, there are several workloads showing better speedup.  In case
of parsec3/canneal, the speedup changed from 3.86% to 6.34%.

Also note that ETHP's memory savings for the workloads showing less speedup are
much improved.  For example, the memory overhead of ETHP for splash2x/ocean_ncp
was 24.4% before, but only 3.5% now.

This is due to the fact that I didn't update the schemes for the updated DAMON.
Basically, the effect of the schemes are access pattern dependent.  In this
case, because DAMON has changed so that it might report access pattern that
different from that of previous version, the schemes should also be modified to
make best performance.  However, I didn't update the schemes because those are
for only proof of the concepts, not for productions.

The change of report was not so huge, fortunately.  I also confirmed this with
my human eyes by comparing the visualized access patterns of the two version.
The overall trend (better performance, less memory overhead) also changed only
subtle.  However, some individual workloads got some remarkable changes.
