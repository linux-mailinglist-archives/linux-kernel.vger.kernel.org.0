Thank you. I'm familiarizing myself with the code. Is there anyone I 
could discuss some details with? I don't want to create too much noise here.

For example, are file pages created by mmaping files and are anon page 
exclusively allocated on heap (RW data)? If so, where do "streaming IO" 
pages belong to?

In general, I found there are very few user accessible knobs for 
adjusting caching, especially in the pre-OOM phase. On the other hand, 
swapping, dirty page caching, have many options or can even be disabled 
completely.

For example, I would like to try disabling/limiting eviction of some/all 
file pages (for example exec pages) akin to disabling swapping, but 
there is no such mechanism. Yes, there would likely be problems with 
large RO mmapped files that would need to be addressed, but in many 
applications users would be interested in having such options.

Adjusting how aggressive/conservative the system should be with the OOM 
killer also falls into this category.

You are right. I've assumed earlyoom is more accurate because of OOM 
killer performing better on a system that isn't stalled yet (perhaps it 
does). But actually, earlyoom doesn't trigger OOM killer at all:

https://github.com/rfjakob/earlyoom#why-not-trigger-the-kernel-oom-killer

Apparently some applications (chrome and electron-based tools) set their 
oom_score_adj incorrectly - this matches my observations of OOM killer 
behavior:

This is the script I used. It reliably reproduces the issue: 
https://github.com/ndrw6/import_postcodes/blob/master/import_postcodes.py 
but it has quite a few dependencies, needs some input data and, in 
general, does a lot more than just fill up the memory. I will try to 
come up with something simpler.

Best regards,

ndrw
