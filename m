Yes the comment is wrong, or at least unclear. It isn't well defined how
SSID is supposed to work with iommu.passthrough, but I guess keeping the
same behavior as non-PASID DMA is what we want (any PASID-tagged DMA
also bypasses the SMMU.)

In the comment I was referring to another possibility, supporting SVA
and auxiliary domains even when iommu.passthrough is set. That would
require allocating context tables and setting S1DSS=BYPASS. But I don't
think it's a feature anyone needs at the moment.

Yes, PASID 0 is reserved, we start allocation at 1

Sure, that's safer
