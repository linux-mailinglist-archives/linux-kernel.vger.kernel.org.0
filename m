Thanks a lot for clarifying this point, I was also not sure whether I
would need combine the platform-specific functionality with LPSS
implementation.

This I believe would not be an option since the Aero platform has been
phased-out from Intel, and Insyde most probably would not do an update
on the BIOS. I can go with DSDT overlay, but I was not sure whether
this is a good way to solve this.

This would be my preferred solution, since in this case I can contain
all the Aero-specific modifications to it's own board file. If there
would be further modifications needed for it - they would be nicely
contained within that board file.

Just as I indicated above, chances that BIOS would receive an update
are between slim and nil. If no one have any objection, I'd prefer to
go with the approach [2] from above.
