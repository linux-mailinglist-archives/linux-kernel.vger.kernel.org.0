Imagine your network driver doesn't implement a .shutdown method (so the 
hardware is still active regardless of device links), happens to have an 
Rx buffer or descriptor ring DMA-mapped at an IOVA that looks like the 
physical address of the memory containing some part of the kernel text 
lower down that call stack, and the MAC receives a broadcast IP packet 
at about the point arm_smmu_device_shutdown() is returning. Enjoy 
debugging that ;)

And if coincidental memory corruption seems too far-fetched for your 
liking, other fun alternatives might include "display tries to scan out 
from powered-off device, deadlocks interconnect and prevents anything 
else making progress", or "access to TZC-protected physical address 
triggers interrupt and over-eager Secure firmware resets system before 
orderly poweroff has a chance to finish".

Of course the fact that in practice we'll *always* see the warning 
because there's no way to tear down the default DMA domains, and even if 
all devices *have* been nicely quiesced there's no way to tell, is 
certainly less than ideal. Like I say, it's not entirely clear-cut 
either way...

Robin.
