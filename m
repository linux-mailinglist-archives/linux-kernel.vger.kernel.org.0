Aah, I see.

Well at leat we want the dynamic allocation away from the callback e.g.
use a fixed array:

#define TPM_CRB_MAX_RESOURCES 4 /* Or however many you need */

struct list_head acpi_res_list;
struct acpi_resource *acpi_res_array[TPM_CRB_MAX_RESOURCES];
void __iomem *iobase_array[TPM_CRB_MAX_RESOURCES];

If there are more resources than the constant you could issue a warning
to klog but still try top continue initialization.

PS. Use for new symbols TPM_CRB_ and tpm_crb_ prefixes. Because of
easier tracing of TPM code I want to move to this naming over time.
