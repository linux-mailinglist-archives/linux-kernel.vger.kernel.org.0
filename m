It guarantees "at least once" which is enough for this case.

Ouch. This works only once and there is no way to rearm it back.
Now I see why this thing never worked for me recent years =)

Maybe it's better reset sysctl_hardlockup_all_cpu_backtrace
to let user set sysctl back to 1.
Or rearm it back in softlockup watchdog after timeout.

It's hard to imagine arch which actually needs barrires here.
Softlockup timers will eventually see the change.
