Yes.

Makes sense.

printk_safe is not really necessary. As you wrote, nobody
is interested into messages from CPUs that are supposed
to be stopped.

It might be enough to set some global variable, for example,
with the CPU number that is calling panic() and is the only
one allowed to print messages from this point on.

It might even be used to force console lock owner to leave
the cycle immediately.

Sounds good.

IMHO, it will be acceptable only when it is reasonably simple and
straightforward. The panic() code is full of special hacks and
it is already complicated to follow all the twists.

Especially because this scenario came up from a theoretical
discussion. Note that my original, real bug report, was
with logbuf_lock NMI, enabled kdump notifiers, ...
