John,

Based on the comments there is going to be a v6 but in any case I am
starting testing of this patchset on several large core systems across
multiple architectures (x86_64, ARM64, s390, ppc64le).  Some of those
systems are known to fail boot due to the large amount of printk output so
it will be good to see if these changes resolve those issues.

Sorry for the delay and I'll report back in a few days.

P.
