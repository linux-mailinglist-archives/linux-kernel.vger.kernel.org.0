The video=tegrafb is invalid mode, there is nothing to argue here. And
the problem is that invalid modes and not rejected for the very beginning.

No, we won't. Rotation mode is parsed into the DRM_MODE bitmask and
rotate=0 corresponds to DRM_MODE_ROTATE_0, which is BIT(0) as you may
notice. Hence rotation_reflection=0 is always an invalid value, meaning
that "rotate" option does not present in the cmdline. Please consult the
code, in particular see drm_mode_parse_cmdline_options() which was
written by yourself ;)
