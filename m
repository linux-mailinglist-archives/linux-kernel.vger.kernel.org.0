It is not the fact that perf issues rcu_read_lock() that is the problem.
As we established yesterday, I can probably remove most rcu_read_lock()
calls from perf today (yay RCU flavour unification).

The problem is that the core perf code uses RCU managed data; and we
need an existence guarantee for it. It would be BAD (TM) if the
ring-buffer we're writing data to were to suddenly dissapear under our
feet etc..

Again, rcu_read_lock() itself really isn't the problem. But we need
NMIs, just like regular interrupts, to imply rcu_read_lock(). That is,
any observable (RCU managed) pointer must stay valid during the NMI/IRQ
execution.

> considering that those can be nested on top of rcuidle context ?

As per nmi_enter() calling rcu_nmi_enter() I've always assumed that NMIs
are fully covered by RCU.

If this isn't so, RCU it terminally broken :-)
