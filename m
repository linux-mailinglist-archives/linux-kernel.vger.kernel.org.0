Well, no. tick_nohz_restart() can be invoked in a situation where the timer
is armed for something in the far future (or completelt disabled) due to
previously entering an estimated long idle (or user space execution on
NOHZ_FULL) period.

That means if the timer is not canceled, realigned to the current tick and
forwarded to the next due tick, the tick will not fire on time causing
another sort of trouble.

Care to give that a shot?
