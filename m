Indeed, it is not there just yet. There are a few differences w.r.t.
the kernel style that aren't supported yet. However, for block/batch
conversions, it is very useful.

Luckily, one of the biggest ones (the consecutive macros alignment,
and we have a lot of them given this is C and a kernel) is going away
with LLVM 9 which is about to be released next week.

If that day comes, I hope we can all agree to a single format and
apply it everywhere as other major projects have done. I think
agreeing to a given style is much, much easier for any of us when
formatting is fully automatic -- because at that point you don't need
to spend mental cycles (and memory!) on it. :-)

If I had to guess, I would say the path forward will start with some
subsystem maintainers starting to apply clang-format systematically on
their trees. That is why I think it is very useful that Dan tries it
out and let us know his impressions.

Cheers,
Miguel
