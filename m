Ah, I see.  So for sleep / wake commands we never directly wait for
them to go out on the bus while the system is awake.  We just program
them all to the RPMH hardware and they'll set there and all get sent
automatically when the last CPU goes into deepest low power mode.

...so actually the whole point of OSI mode (from an RPMH perspective)
is not to avoid transactions on the bus.  It's just avoiding
programming RPMH over and over again.  Is that correct?

...and the reason we have all these data structures in the kernel is
to keep track of auxiliary information about the things in the
sleep/wake TCSs and make it easier to update bits of them?

OK, I got it now.  I'll try to spend some time tomorrow looking over
everything / testing with my new understanding.

Ah, interesting.  I'll read the code more, but are you expecting this
type of situation to work today, or is it theoretical for the future?

I ended up pulling those in but I was still not seeing things work as
I expected.  I'll debug more tomorrow to see if it was my expectations
that were wrong or if there was a real issue.

OK, that's something to keep in mind.  Agree that it doesn't have the
