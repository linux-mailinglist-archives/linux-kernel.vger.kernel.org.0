We have been using that interface and implementation for couple of
years and have not seen any race condition. However I am fine with
what you have here for now. We can always come back if we think we
need to improve it.

I was also planning to look into that and it seems like you are
already on it. Do CC me the patches.

By gone, do you mean the kmem cache got freed or the kmem cache is not
part of online parent memcg and thus no more dead kmem cache?

I would like to see the recognition of reparent'ed kmem cache in this
patch. However if others are ok with the current status of the patch
then I will not stand in the way.
