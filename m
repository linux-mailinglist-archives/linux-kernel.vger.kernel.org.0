yep

my two main motivations were:
- keeping the 32-bit SoCs as similar as possible to the 64-bit ones in
terms of "how are the [clock] drivers implemented"
- with the DDR clock controller the .dts looked weird: &ddr_clkc took
CLKID_XTAL from &clkc as input and &clkc took DDR_CLKID_DDR_PLL as
input from &ddr_clkc

RE complexity in the driver to support both:
I still have a cleanup of the meson8b.c init code on my TODO-list
because we're still supporting .dtbs without parent syscon
my plan is to drop that code-path along with the newly added fallback
for "skip CLKID_XTAL" (assuming this is accepted) together for v5.6 or
v5.7
