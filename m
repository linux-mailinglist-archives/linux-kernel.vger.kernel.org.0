Ha, ha. syzbot reported the same problem using write_mem().

We want fatal_signal_pending() check on both sides.

By the way, write_mem() worries me whether there is possibility of replacing
kernel code/data with user-defined memory data supplied from userspace.
If write_mem() were by chance replaced with code that does

   while (1);

we won't be able to return from write_mem() even if we added fatal_signal_pending() check.
Ditto for replacing local variables with unexpected values...
