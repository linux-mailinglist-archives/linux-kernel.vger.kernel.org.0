There are still a couple of calls that will be done until mm_count
reaches 0:

- mm_free_pgd(mm);
- destroy_context(mm);
- mmu_notifier_mm_destroy(mm);
- check_mm(mm);
- put_user_ns(mm->user_ns);

These are not big items, but holding it off for a long time is still not
a good thing.

What I have found is that a long running process on a mostly idle system
with many CPUs is likely to cycle through a lot of the CPUs during its
lifetime and leave behind its mm in the active_mm of those CPUs.  My
2-socket test system have 96 logical CPUs. After running the test
program for a minute or so, it leaves behind its mm in about half of the
CPUs with a mm_count of 45 after exit. So the dying mm will stay until
all those 45 CPUs get new user tasks to run.

I need to switch the mm off the dying one. mm switching is only done in
context_switch(). I don't think finish_task_switch() is the right place.
