Yes, I understand your concern.

But as mentioned in the cover letter I did try the suggestions and have
detailed reasoning why that's still an issue. In short I ended up
re-inventing mailbox framework with all the queuing and similar APIs
for this. Worse, we can't even add an extra node for that in DT to
describe that. It can't be simple shim as we need to allow multiple
users to access one physical channel at a time. We have use case
where we can this for CPU DVFS fast switching in scheduler context.

Agreed and I am not saying that's incorrect or asking to remove
support for that. Future versions of MHU are making it more complex
and the specification classify the 3 modes of transport protocol in which
the new controller can be configured and used.

The choice is left to platform based on use case to get best/optimal
results. That's the reason I am trying to convince you that we need to
support all those configurations/transport protocols in the Linux
mailbox controller driver. As you mention one use-case of MHU, the word
transfer with 2^32 - 1 options is optimal for IoT use-case where as
doorbell mode is optimal for heavy payloads. The newer versions of
MHU are designed keeping both configurations in mind and the same is
suggested by h/w teams to
various vendors.


Arnd has similar suggestions(something like patch 1) to deal with such
configurations/transport protocols. Please note I am referring to
different transport protocols and not message protocols(SCPI/SCMI fall
under this category)

Thanks.
