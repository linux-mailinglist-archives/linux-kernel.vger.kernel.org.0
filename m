A couple notes:

1) The odds of getting new bootloaders for 5yr old phones is basically
   none.. and they are typically signed so we couldn't just write our
   own even if we wanted to.

2) The windows arm laptops shipping actually have "real" UEFI+ACPI..
   for now we've been using device-tree to get linux booting on them.
   But I think we are going to need to shift to ACPI eventually.. so
   a dt specific solution isn't super helpful.

   But we do have EFI GOP to get the address of the boot framebuffer,
   and I believe there is a reserved memory region setup for it.
   Not sure how to connect that to the iommu subsys.

3) The automatic attach of DMA domain is also causing a different
   problem for us on the GPU side, preventing us from supporting per-
   context pagetables (since we end up with a disagreement about
   which context bank is used between arm-smmu and the firmware).

I'm kinda glad that x86 folks were more pragmatic about getting linux
to work on actual hardware, not just restricting things to hw that
looked the way they wanted it too.. at some point in arch/arm64 we are
going to have to decide that reality is a thing.  Ignoring that is
only going to force users and distros to downstream kernels.
