One shouldn't *test* with something different from what people are running but
once a problem has been identified I don't see the problem with changing the
kernel to make diagnosis easier (assuming the problem is reproduceable). 
Though I suppose one could just locally apply a "no pointer hashing" patch
when debugging...

Losing %lx on the return address would be a minor annoyance (harder to verify
that you're looking at the right stack frame in a dump, more steps to look up
the line number when modules and kaslr aren't involved, etc), but %pS doesn't
help with stack addresses themselves -- and yes, digging into the actual stack
data (via kdump, external debugger, etc.) is sometimes useful.  Maybe
condition it on it being an actual crash dump and not some other caller of
show_stack()?
