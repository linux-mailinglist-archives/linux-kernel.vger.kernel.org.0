What you shared below seems to indicate that removing WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE
didn't work.

Reading this comment is what made me think to ask:

Well I read it all ;)  

I don't have a commit 37a186225a0c, the original commit in querstion is
a1b89132dc4 right?

But I think we need a deeper understanding from workqueue maintainers on
what the right way forward is here.  I cc'd Tejun in my previous reply
but IIRC he no longer looks after the workqueue code.

I think it'd be good for you to work with the original author of commit
a1b89132dc4 (Tim, on cc) to see if you can reach consensus on what works
for both of your requirements.

Given 7 above, if your new "cros_ec at realtime" series fixes it.. ship
it?
