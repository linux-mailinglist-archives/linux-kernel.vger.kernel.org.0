Why?  Even in the Graphene case the final .sigstruct can be known ahead of
time.  Userspace can always use memfd() if it's generating SIGSTRUCT on
the fly.

It wouldn't even need FILE__EXECMOD, assuming Graphene does all of its
libc rewriting before building the enclave, i.e. doesn't EADD RWX pages.

Yep.

I think I'd be ok either way?  What I really care about is having line of
sight to a sane way to support for SGX2, and both seem sane.  I.e. we can
hash this detail out when SGX2 goes in.
