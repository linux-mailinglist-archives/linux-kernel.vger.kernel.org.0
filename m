Hi Balakrishna,

> This patch will fix the below issues
> 1. Discarding memory dump events if memdump state is moved to
>    MEMDUMP_TIMEOUT.
> 2. Fixed race conditions between qca_hw_error() and qca_controller_memdump
>    while free memory dump buffers using mutex lock
> 3. Moved timeout timer to delayed work queue
> 4. Injecting HW error event in a case when dumps failed to receive and HW
>    error event is not yet received.
> 5. Clearing hw error and command timeout function callbacks before
>    sending pre shutdown command.
> 
> Collecting memory dump will follow any of the below sequence.
> 
> Sequence 1:
>   Receiving Memory dump events from the controller
>   Received entire dump in stipulated time
>   Received HW error event from the controller
>   Controller Reset from HOST
> 
> Sequence 2:
>   Receiving Memory dump events from the controller
>   Failed to Receive entire dump in stipulated time
>   A Timeout schedules and if no HW error event received a fake HW
>     error event will be injected.
>   Controller Reset from HOST.
> 
> Sequence 3:
>   Received HW error event
>   HOST trigger SSR by sending crash packet to controller.
>   Received entire dump in stipulated time
>   Controller Reset from HOST
>
