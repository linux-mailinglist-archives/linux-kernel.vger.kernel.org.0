Before I address all the comments, a friendly reminder: Whatever
solution we come up with needs to work on a system with loadable
modules and shouldn't depend on userspace for correctness.

So, are you saying all clock bindings are mandatory for a device for
all possible users of DT + Linux? Do you think if we have a patch that
makes all clock bindings mandatory dependencies, no one would object
to that?

Isn't the a perfect example of the pinctrl being an optional
dependency in that specific case? The kernel still booted if pinctrl
wasn't available?

I don't agree that the dependency is purely a property of the OS. If
there's no clock to clock the hardware core, then the hardware just
can't work. There's no question about that. However, there can be
clock bindings that aren't mandatory for functionality but are needed
just for performance/power control.

Another perfect example are clock providers. Clock providers often get
input clocks from multiple other clock providers and even have cyclic
clock bindings. But only some of them are mandatory for the clock
provider to work. For example, clock provider A has input clocks from
clock providers B and C, but it only needs B to function (provides
root clock to all clocks). Not having C would only affect 4 (out of
100s of clocks) from clock provider A and those 4 are clocks depend on
an input clock from C (basically clock from C going to A to have some
clock gates and dividers added and sent back to C). This isn't even a
made up scenario -- there are SoCs that actually have this.

The OS could still choose to not probe the device unless full
functionality is available or it could assume all clocks are left on
by the bootloader and provide basic functionality. THAT would be the
property of the OS. But that doesn't remove the fact that some of the
resources are absolutely mandatory for the hardware to function. I'm
proposing the depends-on to capture the true hardware dependency --
not what the SW chooses to do with it.

"avoids the useless work attempting probes of devices that will not
probe successfully" -- I never claimed to save boot up time. Your
argument about having to save wall clock time is a moot point as a ton
of kernel features that optimize code won't save wall clock time (the
CPU would just run faster to make up for the inefficiency). Those
features just make the kernel less resource hungry and more efficient.
I'd understand your argument if this patch series is insanely complex
-- but that's not the case here.

That's what this patch series is -- it makes the kernel smarter by
just using the data from DT instead of relying on manual tweaking of
initcall and link order.

Well, you need to back that opinion with reasoning. IMO we should
disable unused resources so that we don't waste power -- especially on
devices operating on batteries.

Also, I explicitly said "need to keep the resources they provide
active and at a particular state(s) during boot up". So it's not even
about auto disabling. For example, in the case of a voltage regulator
supplying multiple devices, if the first device probes and says it
only need the lowest voltage level, you can't just drop the voltage.
Because the other devices in the same voltage rail haven't probed yet
and you can crash the system if you just drop the voltage. You need to
wait for all the devices to be probed and then you can let the voltage
regulator operate normally. And you can't depend on late_initcall
because it falls apart on systems with modules.
