I'm not suggesting all or nothing for all rb tree users, I'm suggesting
an all or nothing approach to users of a *new* API. That is, users would
still need to be converted over, and *iff* the new kconfig entry is
enabled would the two pointers be added / used, otherwise we'd fallback
to the default current boring rbtree.

The approach would allow distros which are not yet sure if two pointers
are worth it yet to continue to chug on as they used to, but also allow
them to explore this prospect in a flexible way.
