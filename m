I don't know where to start :)

1. We don't run/have x86-to-x86 emulator and syzkaller is currently
supported on 6 architectures.
2. Complexity of this is very high (as compared to an if in kernel).
3. Valgrind-like solutions are a source of constant maintenance work
(we maintained valgrind for year at google).
4. Adding new architectures will be much harder.
5. All of this will need to be part of all C reproducers as well
(thousands of lines of intricate code, I think it was you who
complained about the complexity of even current C reproducers).
6. To not make this part of all reproducers we would need to run the
checking ahead of time (but this requires building complete and
precise kernel model and won't handle non-determinism; this is why I
referred to the "halting problem" assuming you don't want this in
reproducers).
7. This won't handle raciness between our checks and what kernel
really observes (i.e. we infer different fd type for ioctl, or we read
different data from memory).
8. This won't solve the problem of trust. If you receive this very
complex piece of code, will you be 100% sure that it's not syzkaller's
fault but a kernel bug that worth your time looking at.

So as far as I see this is both very complex and won't really work.

This is subject to most of the same problem.
E.g. these BPF programs will need to be part of all reproducers, so
you will need to compile them for your kernel and install before
running reproducers. Also racy wrt what we observe and what kernel
acts on. Again some trust problems (it is still complex). Building and
using syzkaller will be harder.

We need to keep in mind that we are comparing this with is a simple if
in kernel code.

We can easily filter out syscall numbers and top level syscall
argument values (executing random binary code aside, as we gave up on
this for now). That's what we use to filter out reboot syscalls and
FIFREEZE ioctl (fortunately the value does not collide with any other
ioctl we have _for now_). This is done by scanning the test case and
fixing it if necessary (all the necessary data is already there).
