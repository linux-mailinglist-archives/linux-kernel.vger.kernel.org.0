The order of each individual slab page is stored in struct page. That is
why every slub slab page can have a different order. This enabled fallback
to order 0 allocations and also allows a dynamic configuration of the
order at runtime.

What do you mean by "general purpose? Certainly the allocator should not
blow up when forcing zero order allocations.

Hmmm. races increases as more metadata is added that is depending on the
size of the slab page and the number of objects in it.
