IMA works at the file level.  I'm not sure what it would mean to
measure "segments".

Originally, kexec_file_load read the KEXEC kernel image twice, once to
calculate the file hash, and again to verify the signature.  Now
kexec_file_load calls kernel_read_file_from_fd, which reads the file
into memory, before IMA calculates the file buffer hash.

Yes

Right, the original version addressed this, but was nixed by Eric,
saying it was unnecessary.  The current version allocates more memory
than needed to hopefully compensate.

No, the kexec load will succeed, but if there isn't enough memory to
store the measurement list, the exec should fail.
