We only take patches that are in Linus's tree for the stable tree,
unless there are very big reasons not to do so (i.e. it is totally
rewritten in a different way there.)

Once the change/fix is in Linus's tree, then you can backport it to
stable in a different way if you want, but you need to give lots of
reasons why it is done that way.
