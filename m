Yep, no problem. I am glad if I could get some idea from you.

Thanks for your explanation. I am trying to understand the connection between
those cases and the behavior of kswapd.

In summary, all three cases are related to direct reclaim, while happens in
three different timing of kswapd:

   a) premature sleep
   b) full sleep
   c) full sleep after reclaim lower zone

Hmm... I am not sure the difference between b) and c). Looks both face direct
reclaim when kswapd is sleeping.

If I am correct, direct reclaim here is performed by function
__perform_reclaim(). Its scan order and zone_idx is retrieved from allocation
parameters, so it doesn't affect pgdat{.kswapd_order, .kswapd_classzone_idx} if
I am correct.

Direct reclaim do affect the pgdat status. After reclaiming, we may have more
available pages. But I am stuck in the connection between direct reclaim and
kswapd. Would you mind sharing more light on this part?
