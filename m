Since a platform typically uses only a few signing keys, 4 bytes makes 
the chance of a collision quite small.  The collision would have to be 
within the same log, not global.

In that worst case, the verifier would have to try two keys.  It's a
slight performance penalty, but does anything break?

A new template with a larger SKI, perhaps 8 bytes, might be safer.  It 
doesn't expand the log size nearly as much as having a full public key.

The TPM just ensures that the log has not been altered.  It does nothing 
for signature verification, right?

The verifier can check that the supplied signature matches the supplied 
public key.  However, how could it verify that the public key is trusted 
to sign the code?  Doesn't that have to be out of band?

E.g., an attacker could create a log with their own signatures and 
public keys.  The signature would verify, but it's the attacker's key.

It's essentially a self-signed file.

If you include the public key only once, don't you have the same 
collision problem?  Two log entries could (in theory) and the same SKI. 
How would the verifier know which public key to use.

However, I think the fundamental question is whether the verifier can 
accept public keys supplied by the untrusted client.  I believe that the 
verifier has to receive the public keys out of band, from a trusted 
source - not the client.
