Thank you very much for your summary of uses of random numbers in 
Systemd and also for your other mail that "neither RDRAND nor /dev/
urandom know a concept of of "depleting entropy"". I thought they would 
deplete entropy needed to the initial seeding of crng.

Thank you also for taking part in this discussion, even if someone put 
your mail address on carbon copy without asking with.

I do not claim I understand enough of this random number stuff. But I 
feel its important that kernel and userspace developers actually talk 
with each other about a sane approach for it. And I believe that the 
complexity involved is part of the issue. I feel an API for attaining 
random number with different quality levels needs to be much, much, much 
more simple to use *properly*.

I felt a bit overwhelmed by the discussion (and by what else is 
happening in my life, just having come back from holding a Linux 
performance workshop in front of about two dozen people), so I intend to 
step back from it. 

If one of my mails actually helped to encourage or facilitate kernel 
space and user space developers talking with each other about a sane 
approach to random numbers, then I may have used my soft skills in a way 
that brings some benefit. For the technical aspects certainly people are 
taking part in this discussion who are much much deeper into the 
intricacies of entropy in Linux and computers in general, so I just hope 
for a good outcome.

Best,
