Huh, I assumed the plan is that whenever there's a cma region, we want
to instantiate a dma-buf heap for it? Why/when would we not want to do
that?

So the CMA core code is also a module, or how does that work? Not
loading the cma dma-buf heap, but keeping all the other cma code
around feels slightly silly. Do we have numbers that justify this
silliness?

I think for upstream I'd want to see those other heaps first. If
they're mostly driver allocators exposed as heaps, then I think we
need something different than heap modules, maybe allow dma-buf to
allocate from drivers instead. But afaiui all such driver allocators
we have in upstream are cma regions only right now.
