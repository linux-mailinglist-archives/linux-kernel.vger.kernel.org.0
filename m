I agree with Kai-Heng, this seems like a fairly light-weight solution 
to a reasonable problem.

As to the issue of how much it will slow down system shutdowns, I have 
no idea.  Probably not very much, unless somebody has an unusually 
large number of USB devices plugged in, but only testing can give a 
real answer.

I suppose we could add an HCD flag for host controllers which require 
this workaround.  Either way, it's probably not a very big deal.
