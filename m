We don't use a specific workload because we thought this is a general
optimization.  I will explain more later in this email.

Let's look at this problem in another perspective.  To migrate the
MADV_FREE pages of the QEMU process from the node A to the node B, we
need to free the original pages in the node A, and (maybe) allocate the
same number of pages in the node B.  So the question becomes

- we may need to allocate some pages in the node B
- these pages may be accessed by the application or not
- we should allocate all these pages in advance or allocate them lazily
  when they are accessed.

We thought the common philosophy in Linux kernel is to allocate lazily.

That is, because we will always free the original pages in the node A,
the question isn't whether we should free these MADV_FREE pages, but
whether we should allocate the same number of pages in the node B before
we know whether they are really needed.  We thought this is similar as
whether we should allocate all physical pages when mmap().

We will always discard memory when migrating pages.  Our reasoning is as
above.
