Agree, OOM just asking the question: can i unmap that page quickly ?
so that me (OOM) can swap it out. In many cases the driver need to
lookup something to see if at the time the memory is just not in use
and can be reclaim right away. So driver should have a path to
optimistically update its state to allow quick reclaim.

I feel that the fs_reclaim_acquire() is just too heavy weight here. I
do think that Daniel patches improve the debugging situation without
burdening anything so i am in favor or merging that.

I do not think we should devote too much time into fs_reclaim(), our
time would be better spend in improving the driver shrinker for instance
after all OOM is all about trying to free-up memory.
