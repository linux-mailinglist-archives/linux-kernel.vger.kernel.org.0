Not in my mind; any instances of the same IP can have the same ID,
regardless of which SoC they're in. Once userspace learns about
device-foo-4000, it knows about it on all SoCs. That also means you can
support heterogeneous instances in the same SoC.

If a device varies so much on a SoC-by-SoC basis and or the driver has
no idea what to expose, it could be legitimate for the PMU driver to
expose the SoC ID as its PMU-specific ID, but I don't think we should
make that the common/only case.

For imx8, the DT compat string or additional properties on the DDRC node
could be used to imply the id.

Ok, I hadn't appreciated that the PMCG did not have an ID register
itself.

I think that the relationship between the SMMU and PMCG is a stronger
argument against using the SOC_ID. If the PMCGs in a system are
heterogeneous, then you must know the type of the specific instance.

I think that might be necessary, as otherwise we're going to back
ourselves into a corner by building what's simple now.

Thanks,
Mark.
