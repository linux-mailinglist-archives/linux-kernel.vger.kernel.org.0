One further comment. In talking with my colleagues here who know eBPF
much better
than I do, it may not be possible to implement something this
complicated with eBPF.

If that is in the fact the case, then we'd have to try and hook the
OOM Reporting code
with tracepoints similar to kprobes only we want to do more than add counters
we want to change the flow to skip small output entries that aren't
worth printing.
If this isn't feasible with eBPF, then some derivative or our approach
or enhancing
the OOM output code directly seem like the best options. Will have to
investigate
this further.
