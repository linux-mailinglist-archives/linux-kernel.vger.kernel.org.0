Ohh, right I forgot that it will get retried. This would be useful to
mention in the changelog as it is not straightforward from reading just
the particular function.

Well, I strongly suspect this is a relict from the past. I have hard
time to believe that the system would get to a usable state if many of
those caches would fail to allocate. And as Dave said in his reply it is
quite silly to give this weapon to a random driver hands. Everybody just
thinks his toy is the most important one...
