The situation is that when the power is off, we have a battery to save some
information, but the battery power is limited, so we reduce the power consumption
by turning off the cores, and need fastly to complete the core shutdown. However, the
time of cpu_psci_cpu_kill() will take 10ms. We have tested the time that it does not
need 10ms, and most case is about 50us-500us. if we reduce the time of cpu_psci_cpu_kill(),
we can reduce 10% - 30% of the total time.

So change msleep (10) to usleep_range() to reduce the waiting time. In addition,
we don't want to be scheduled during the sleeping time, some threads may take a
long time and don't give up the CPU, which affects the time of core shutdown,
Therefore, we add a chance to busy-wait max 1ms.

thanks.
