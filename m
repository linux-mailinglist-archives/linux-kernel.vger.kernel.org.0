The preempt_tracer is there as part of the preempt_irqsoff tracer
implementation. By removing it, the only code we would remove is
displaying preemptoff as a tracer. I stated this when it was created,
that it was more of an academic exercise if you use it, but that code
was required to get preempt_irqsoff working.

That's basically what I was suggesting as the solution to this ;-)

Note, there's places that disable preemption without being traced. If
we trigger only on preemption being disabled and start the "timer",
there may not be any code to stop it. That was why I recommended the
flag in the code that starts the timing.

But he does bring up an issues that preempt_irqsoff fails.
