The domain loop within select_task_rq_fair() depends on a few bits of
input, namely the SD flag we're looking for and whether we want_affine.

For !want_affine, the domain loop will walk up the hierarchy to reach the
highest domain with both SD_LOAD_BALANCE and the requested sd_flag
(SD_BALANCE_{WAKE, FORK, EXEC}) set.
In other words, that's a call to highest_flags_domain() for these two
flags. Note that this is a static information wrt a given SD hierarchy,
so we can cache that - but that comes in a later patch to ease reviewing.

For want_affine, we'll walk up the hierarchy to reach the first domain
with SD_LOAD_BALANCE, SD_WAKE_AFFINE, and that spans the tasks's prev_cpu.
We still save a pointer to the last visited domain that had the requested
sd_flag set (and SD_LOAD_BALANCE), which means that if we fail to go
through the affine condition (e.g. no domain had SD_WAKE_AFFINE) we'll use
the same SD as we would have found if we had !want_affine.

Split the domain loop in !want_affine and want_affine paths. As it is,
this leads to two domain walks instead of a single one, but stay tuned for
the next patch.
