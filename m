Because the purpose of the driver is to read from the registers which
chip it is. If we tell it via the compatible what it is supposed to be,
1) only the revision would need to be read, and 2) how should it react
if the compatible tells it one thing and the register value another.

Also it doesn't solve the problem that we may need to extend the binding
as new models emerge, or instead of just rtd1195, rtd1295, rtd1395, etc.
we'd also need one for each chip, i.e., rtd1296, cf. 1) above.

Agreed in general.

Hope you also read the cover letter wrt syscon? That would probably
obsolete this binding then and require to move the driver's logic into a
module init instead for lack of dedicated compatible to bind against,
like Meson does.
