Yes, thanks, much.  Maybe a code comment along the lines of

  This is on behalf of the oom reaper, specifically when it is
  calling the mmu notifiers.  The problem is that if the notifier were
  to block on, for example, mutex_lock() and if the process which holds
  that mutex were to perform a sleeping memory allocation, the oom
  reaper is now blocked on completion of that memory allocation.

btw, do we need task_struct.non_block_count?  Perhaps the oom reaper
thread could set a new PF_NONBLOCK (which would be more general than
PF_OOM_REAPER).  If we run out of PF_ flags, use (current == oom_reaper_th).
