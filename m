Hi Linus,

Here are two fixes:

/* Summary */
- Panic earlier when global init exits to generate useable coredumps.
  Currently, when global init and all threads in its thread-group have exited
  we panic via:
  do_exit()
  -> exit_notify()
     -> forget_original_parent()
        -> find_child_reaper()
  This makes it hard to extract a useable coredump for global init from a
  kernel crashdump because by the time we panic exit_mm() will have already
  released global init's mm. We now panic slightly earlier. This has been
  a problem in certain environments such as Android. 

- Fix a race in assigning and reading taskstats for thread-groups with more
  than one thread.
  This patch has been waiting for quite a while since people disagreed on what
  the correct fix was at first.

/* Testing */
No build failures or warnings were observed.

/* Conflicts */
