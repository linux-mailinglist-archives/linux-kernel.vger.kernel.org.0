I had tested hackbench on SPARC SMT8 (see numbers in cover letter) and
showed improvement with this. Firstly it's a tradeoff between cache effects
vs time spent in searching idle CPU, and both x86 and SPARC numbers showed
tradeoff is worth it. Secondly there is a lot of cache affinity logic
in the beginning of select_idle_sibling. If select_idle_cpu is still called
that means we are past that and want any idle cpu. I don't think waking up
close to the prev cpu is the intention for starting search from there,
rather it is to spread threads across all cpus so that no cpu gets
victimized as there is no atomicity. Prev cpu just acts a good seed to do
the spreading.

Thanks,
Subhra
