Subject: [PATCH 2/3] arm64: nofpsmid: Clear TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag for early tasks

We detect the absence of FP/SIMD after we boot the SMP CPUs, and by then
we have kernel threads running already with TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE set which
could be inherited by early userspace applications (e.g, modprobe triggered
from initramfs). This could end up in the applications stuck in
do_nofity_resume() as we never clear the TIF flag, once we now know that
we don't support FP.

Fix this by making sure that we clear the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE flag
for tasks which may have them set, as we would have done in the normal
case, but avoiding touching the hardware state (since we don't support any).
