The self-extraction hasn't changed much over the years, and basically
follows the same method which has worked for the vast majority of
platforms.

Where things fall down is where things are placed too close, and yes,
as the kernel grows, what was reasonable years ago becomes too close
with modern kernels.

The problem has been compounded by the various different compression
algorithms that can now be used for the compressed kernel.

kexec also ran into this problem, and there is now enough information
in a modern kernel to calculate how much space the decompressor is
going to require.  Have a look at the current kexec sources for how
it is done.
