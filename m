I think the approach in this merge window worked fairly well:
- refactor/rework core mm stuff in (h)mm.git
- handle all the gpu stuff in drm.git
- make the clashes workable through some clever prep patches like
we've done this time around

I think Linus wants to be able to look through core mm stuff quite
closely, so not a good idea if we deeply intertwin it with one of the
biggest subsystems there is. And I don't think there will be a real
conflict like this every merge window, this should be the exception.
Worst case we have to stage some work 1 release cycle apart, i.e.
merge mm stuff first, then drm 3 months later. Usually that's not
going to slow things down noticeable given average merge latency for
core mm features :-)
