Hi Chris,


Thanks for your review.

I will move to v2.

It sounds like it can achieve the results you want, in that it allows you to direct and prioritise reclaim in a way that allows for ballparking (ie. it is compatible with applications with variable memory footprints).

Memory.min, low, high can affect the global shrink behavior.  They can help task keep some pages to help protect performance.

But what I want is the low priority tasks (the tasks that performance is not very important) do more shrink first.  And when low priority tasks doesn’t have enough pages to be dropped and system need more free page, shrink the high priority task’s pages.  Because at this time, system’s stable is more important than the performance of priority task.
With memory.min and memory.low, I have no idea to config them to support this.  That is why I add global shrink priority.

Thanks,
Hui
