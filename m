Could we improve the description of the issue and the change a little
bit? Something like:

In the SD_OVERLAP case, the local variable 'capacity' represents the sum
of CPU capacity of all CPUs in the first sched group (sg) of the sched
domain (sd).

It is erroneously used to calculate sg's min and max CPU capacity.
To fix this use capacity_of(cpu) instead of 'capacity'.

The code which achieves this via cpu_rq(cpu)->sd->groups->sgc->capacity
(for rq->sd != NULL) can be removed since it delivers the same value as
capacity_of(cpu) which is currently only used for the (!rq->sd) case
(see update_cpu_capacity()).
A sg of the lowest sd (rq->sd or sd->child == NULL) represents a single
CPU (and hence sg->sgc->capacity == capacity_of(cpu)).

Nit: Why not

+                       capacity += cpu_cap;
+                       min_capacity = min(cpu_cap, min_capacity);
+                       max_capacity = max(cpu_cap, max_capacity);

like in the !SD_OVERLAP path?
