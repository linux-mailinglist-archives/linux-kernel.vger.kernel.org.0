That is what we had concluded, thanks for the verification.

We didn't see documentation of this in any of the v20 release bullet

Lacking a collection of big beefy development machines with 256+
gigabytes of RAM isn't the challenge, rebooting to test functionality
on the physical hardware is what is a bit of a nuisance.

I don't doubt the justifications, just a bit unusual for a driver, but
this driver is obviously a bit unusual.

It will be interesting to see if the distros compile it in.

Thank you for the clarifications, have a good weekend.
