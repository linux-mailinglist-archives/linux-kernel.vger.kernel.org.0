We have exactly the same problem. Our developers need to update config
files for different architectures and different kernel versions on their
machines which are usually x86_64 but that often produces different
configs than the real build environment.

This is not an issue for upstream development as one usually updates
configs on the same system where the build takes place but it's a big
problem for distribution maintainers.

There are more issues like this. In general, since 4.17 or 4.18, the
resulting config depends on both architecture and compiler version.
Earlier, you could simply run "ARCH=... make oldconfig" (or menuconfig)
to update configs for all architectures and distribution versions.
Today, you need to use the right compiler version (results with e.g.
4.8, 7.4 and 9.2 differ) and architecture.

At the moment, I'm working around the issue by using chroot environments
with target distributions (e.g. openSUSE Tumbleweed) and set of cross
compilers for supported architectures but it's far from perfect and even
this way, there are problemantic points, e.g. BPFILTER_UMH which depends
on gcc being able to not only compile but also link.

IMHO the key problem is that .config mixes configuration with
description of build environment. I have an idea of a solution which
would consist of

  - an option to extract "config" options which describe build
    environment (i.e. their values are determined by running some
    command, rather than reading from a file or asking user) into
    a cache file
  - an option telling "make *config" to use such cache file for these
    environment "config" options instead of running the test scripts
    (and probably issue an error if an environment option is missing)

This would be perhaps even easier if we also separated the environment
descripton into a different file so that we would only need an option
telling scripts/kconfig/conf not to update the environment description.
I'm not sure if that would be acceptable for upstream, though.

Unfortunately I didn't find time to implement this yet.
