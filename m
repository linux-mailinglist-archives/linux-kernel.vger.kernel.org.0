Thanks for the testcase and the patch! I finally got to reading through
this in detail. In udf driver in Linux we are generally fine with the last
extent being rounded up to the block size. udf_truncate_tail_extent() is
generally responsible for truncating the last extent to appropriate size
once we are done with the inode. However there are two problems with this:

1) We used to do this inside udf_clear_inode() back in the old days but
then switched to a different scheme in commit 2c948b3f86e5f "udf: Avoid IO
in udf_clear_inode". So this actually breaks workloads where user calls
truncate(2) directly and there's no place where udf_truncate_tail_extent()
gets called.

2) udf_extend_file() sets i_lenExtents == i_size although the last extent
isn't properly rounded so even if udf_truncate_tail_extent() gets called
(which is actually the case for truncate(1) which does open, ftruncate,
close), it will think it has nothing to do and exit.

Now 2) is easily fixed by setting i_lenExtents to real length of extents we
have created. However that still leaves problem 1) which isn't easy to deal
with. After some though I think that your solution of making
udf_do_extend_file() always create appropriately sized extents makes
sense. However I dislike the calling convention you've chosen. When
udf_do_extend_file() needs to now byte length, then why not pass it to it
directly, instead of somewhat cumbersome "sector length + byte offset"
pair?

Will you update the patch please? Thanks!
