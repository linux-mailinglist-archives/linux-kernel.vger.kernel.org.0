I am not clear on how a vendor would document those controller 
properties then?

And the number of links doesn't seem like a vendor-specific definition, 
if you include the linkID in the register information below it'd help to 
known how many links can be enabled, which ones are used (if there is 
any pin-mux) and check if the configurations are correct.

ok, fine then.

maybe put link first and make it clear that both are required.
