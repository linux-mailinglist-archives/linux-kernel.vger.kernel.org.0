Sorry, this is just a temporary band-aid for v5.3 to get things
working again.  Yes, I realize it is a complete hack.

The root problem is that I'm using the DMA API in the first place.  I
don't actually use the DMA API to map buffers, for various reasons,
but instead manage the iommu_domain directly.

Because arm/arm64 cache ops are not exported to modules, so currently
I need to abuse the DMA API for cache operations (really just to clean
pages if I need to mmap them uncached/writecombine).  Originally I was
doing that w/ dma_{map,unmap}_sg.  But to avoid debug splats I
switched that to dma_sync_sg (see
0036bc73ccbe7e600a3468bf8e8879b122252274).  But now it seems the
dma-direct ops are unhappy w/ dma_sync without a dma_map (AFAICT).

(On some generations of hw, the iommu is attached to the device node
that maps to the drm device, which is passed to dma_map/dma_sync.  On
other generations the iommu is attached to a sub-device.  Changing
this would break dtb compatibility.. so for now I need to handle both
iommu-ops and direct-ops cases.)

For v5.4, my plan was to revisit (at least for arm64) exposing cache
ops to drivers, so I can use drm_clflush_* instead, and stop abusing
DMA API.
