Typical reproducibility is up to ~4 events per 24h. Warnings origin from different processes, mostly involved with the stress tests, but not necessarily with block devices we're stressing. If the warning appeared in process relating to block device stress test, it would be accompanied by corrupted data, as the read operation gets aborted.

Sure, what kernel version(s) should this go to?  4.19 and newer?
