Thanks for your reply, but threre's some points implement inconsistently

1. + s attribute will cause a big performance problem. With only data
   blocks but no index blocks, it is difficult to recover the complete
   data. Therefore, we can also improve data security with the lowest
   cost.
2. In the SSD scenario, discard on some devices cannot guarantee that
   data is erased. but if we update the dirty pages of memory to disk.
   ssd will remap the corresponding lba, then the user will not be able
   to access the old data, it's security.
3. In the small file scenario, the file extent is stored on the inode.
   Because the inode block will not be forgotten by jbd2, the extent on
   the disk is always cleared after the small file is deleted. If security
   is only pretended, why not take effect on the small file.
4. If to facilitate data recovery, why do need to clear extents in
   memory? This operation does not seem to make sense.

I think that the page of the index block is not updated to disk after
the file is deleted, which may be a logical defect.
