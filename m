Let's see, how we use KSM now. It's good for virtual machines: people
install the same distribution in several VMs, and they have the same
packages and the same files. When you read a file inside VM, its pages
are file cache for the VM, but they are anonymous pages for host kernel.

Hypervisor marks VM memory as mergeable, and host KSM merges the same
anonymous pages together. Many of file cache inside VM is constant
content, so we have good KSM compression on such the file pages.
The result we have is explainable and expected.

But we don't know anything about pages, you have merged on your laptop.
We can't make any assumptions before analysis of applications, which
produce such the pages. Let's check what happens before we try to implement
some specific design (if we really need something to implement).

The rest is just technical details. We may implement everything we need
on top of this (even implement a polling of /proc/[pid]/maps and write
a task and address of vma to force_madvise or similar file).
