I'm sure it will, but I can't easily test and measure this number
because I don't have a device with 100s of devices (common in mobile
SoCs) where I can load all the drivers as modules and are supported
upstream. And the current ones I have mostly workaround this in their
downstream tree by manually ordering with initcalls and link order.
But I see the avoidance of useless probes that'll fail as more of a
free side benefit and not the main goal of this patch series. Getting
modules to actually work and crash the system while booting is the
main goal.

Yes, definitely saves loads of busy work.

Thanks!

Yup! Trying to do that. :)
