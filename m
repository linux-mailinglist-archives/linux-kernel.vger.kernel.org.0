That presumably needs to change.

Are we entirely missing an API to allocate a naturally aligned VA
range?  That's kind of annoying.

This isn't necessarily a problem, but we pretty much have to use
mprotect() then.

Maybe the semantics could just be that mmap() on the SGX device gives
natural alignment, but that there is no actual constraint enforced by
the driver as to whether mmap() happens before or after ECREATE.
After all, it's *ugly* for user code to reserve its address range with
an awkward giant mmap(), there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it.

As far as I know from this whole discussion, we still haven't come up
with any credible way to avoid tracking, per enclave page, whether
that page came from unmodified PROT_EXEC memory.
