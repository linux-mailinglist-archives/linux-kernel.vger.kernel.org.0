Ok, fine.

So it indeed looks as if my host-g++ can not properly build gcc-plugins =
for
the arm cross-gcc. This may come from using Darwin as the build host... =
So
it may have/use/need a different gcc for building the gcc-plugin for
cross-building the kernel.

Hm. Yes. The cross-toolchain was bootstrapped from scratch. The HOSTCC
comes from Macports and may be a different version. So it is likely that
the HOSTCC from Macports can not build a compatible gcc-plugin for the
cross-gcc.

That seems to be a significant assumption about the build infrastructure
which now became permanently enabled by the "default y" for GCC_PLUGINS.

I am not sure what the right way forward is. Probably for me it is to =
find
out if I can fix my cross-toolchain. Or if the kernel should better =
check
if gcc-plugins can really be built, if they are automatically enabled.
Or keep all gcc-plugins disabled until explicitly configured for?

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
