I plan to use hw_idx to replace tos, which indicates the low level index 
of raw branch records for the most recent branch aka entries[0].
For other architectures whose raw branch records are already stored in 
age order. The hw_idx should be 0.
If we don't know the order of raw branch records, the hw_idx should be 
-1ULL. I will set hw_idx to -1ULL for IBM Power for now. They can change 
it later if needed.

How about the changes as below?
