It's done against linux-next.
Applied clearly. (Not the version in this more than yearly old series
of course, that's why I told I can resend)

See below.

It provides a mechanism, which seems to be absent, to the second
kernel to know where to look for SMBIOS tables.

Yes, it does.

No, it doesn't.

The problem here as I can see it that EFI and kexec protocols are not
friendly to each other.
I'm not an expert in either. That's why I'm asking for possible
solutions. And this needs to be done in kernel to allow drivers to
work.

It seems not only for 32-bit Linux kernel anymore. MS Surface 3 runs
64-bit code.

It's not only about Galileo anymore.
