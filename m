I agree with that cma area should be used effectively. However, cma_alloc()
failure is functional failure in embedded system so we need to approach
this problem more carefully. At least, to control the behaviour, configurab=

Great! Fixing page migration issue is always good thing!

Unfortunately, I lose my test setup for this problem so cannot try it now.
I will try it as soon as possible.

Anyway, AFAIR, I saw the problem while journal is continually working

Thanks.
