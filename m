Yes, but the commit ID is floating in the tree.

I don't think the earlier patches are needed. If the possible? nested
interrupts described in my previous emails is an issue, the patch
"rcu: don't use negative ->rcu_read_lock_nesting" in this
series is enough to fixed it. If any adjustments needed for
this series, I will just put the adjustments the series.
