IIUC this patch is essentially a band-aid to get back to the scalability that was possible before persistent grant support was added. Ultimately the right answer should be to get rid of persistent grants support and use grant copy, but such a change is clearly more invasive and would need far more testing.

But this is addressing memory shortage only and it is acting globally.

What I'd like to have in some (maybe distant) future is a way to control
resource usage per guest. Why would you want to throttle performance of
all guests instead of only the one causing the pain by hogging lots of
resources?

The new backend callback should (IMO) have a domid as parameter for
specifying which guest should be taken away resources (including the
possibility to select "any domain").

It might be reasonable to have your shrinker hook in e.g. xenbus for
calling the backend callbacks. And you could have another agent in the
grant driver reacting on shortage of possible grant mappings.

I don't expect you to implement all of that at once, but I think having
that idea in mind when addressing current issues would be nice. So as a
starting point you could move the shrinker hook to xenbus, add the
generic callback to struct xenbus_driver, populate that callback in
blkback and call it in the shrinker hook with "any domain". This would
enable a future extension to other backends and a dynamic resource
management in a natural way.
