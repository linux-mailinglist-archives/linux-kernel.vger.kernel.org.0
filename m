The conversion here is really trivial: just a bunch of title
markups and very few puntual changes is enough to make it to
be parsed by Sphinx and generate a nice html.

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
