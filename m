I'm not sure this is really a concern here. We need to maintain the
compatibility with old DT's, but those will have an A33 compatible
too, and as far as I can see, you're not changing anything for that
compatible, so we're in the clear?

If not, then the third option would probably be the best, especially
since it's only a couple of them.
