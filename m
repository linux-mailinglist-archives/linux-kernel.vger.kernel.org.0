It took me a while to discover this way to be able to re-define the
name of a symbol at the C domain, but I'm pretty sure I read this
somewhere at the Sphinx docs (or perhaps on some bug track or Stack
Overflow).

I don't remember exactly where I get it, but I guess it is related to
this:

	http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/howto/rst-roles.html

Sure.

Agreed. As you're doing this, if you prefer, feel free to send the
patches to media docs. Otherwise, I'll seek for some time next week.

Yeah, sure. Just wanted to place the code at the same thread. There are
some tricks that need to be done in order to handle the relative paths.
It took me a lot more time to get it right than adding the replacing Regex :-)

(That reminds I should post a patch to one place where we have a
Documentation/Documentation typo)

Thanks,
Mauro
