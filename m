IMO the main question is who is the intended user of this new knob/API?

If it's intended for system admins to optimize certain workloads on a system
then I like the latency-nice range.

If we want to support application writers to define the latency requirements of
their tasks then I think latency-nice would be very confusing to use.
Especially when one has to consider they lack a pre-knowledge about the system
they will run on; and what else they are sharing the resources with.

$> EAS
====================
The new knob can help EAS path to switch to spreading behavior when
latency-nice is set instead of packing tasks on the most energy efficient CPU.
ie: pick the most energy efficient idle CPU.
