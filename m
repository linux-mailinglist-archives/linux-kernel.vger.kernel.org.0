The client is in control.  Perhaps if you think of this like a NIC - the 
NIC is a dumb pipe that you shove bytes into and get bytes out of.  The 
NIC doesn't know or care what the bytes are, only that it performs its 
responsibilities of successfully moving those bytes through the pipe. 
The bytes could be a TCP packet, UDP packet, raw IP packet, or something 
entirely different.  The NIC doesn't need to know, nor care.

MHI is a little one sided because its designed so that the Host is in 
control for the most part.

In the transmit path, the client on the Host gives the bus a stream of 
bytes.  The DMA-able address of that stream of bytes is put into the bus 
structures, and the doorbell is rung.  Then the device pulls in the data.

In the receive path, the client on the host gives the bus a receive 
buffer.  The DMA-able address of that buffer is put into the bus 
structures.  When the device wants to send data to the host, it picks up 
the buffer address, copies the data into it, and then flags an event to 
the Host.

This structure we are discussing is used in the callback from the bus to 
the client to either signal that the TX buffer has been consumed by the 
device and is now back under the control of the client, or that the 
device has consumed a queued RX buffer, and now the buffer is back under 
the control of the client and can be read to determine what data the 
device sent.

In both cases, its impossible for the bus to know the structure or 
content of the data.  All the bus knows or cares about is the location 
and size of the buffer.  Its entirely up to the control of the client. 
The client could be the network stack, in which case the data is 
probably an IP packet.  The client could be entirely something else 
where the client protocol running over MHI is entirely unique to that 
client.

Since MHI supports arbitrary clients, its impossible to come up with 
some kind of union that describes every possible client's structure 
definitions from now until the end of time.

void * is the only type that makes realistic sense.
