Right, I believe we agreed that pr_flush() would take care of all this.

I understand your wanting to keep compatibility with printf(), but I
would suggest that we only do so if it doesn't complicate any of the
design. I'm actually leaning on recommending that we remove the return
value, to prevent there becoming a dependency on it. I don't see any
reason to have the "number of bytes processed" as the return value
being useful within the kernel.

If worse comes to worse, perhaps we let the console decide what to do
with it. Where all consoles but the "kmsg" one ignores it?

Then journalctl should work as normal.

Or will this break one of our other changes?
