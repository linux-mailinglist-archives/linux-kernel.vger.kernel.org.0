I'm not fully sure that the old behaviour is the correct one, but definitely hmm's pud_entry needs some fixing.
I'm more concerned with the pagewalk code. With your patch it actually splits all huge puds present in the page-table
on each page walk which is not what we want.

One idea would be to add a new member to struct_mm_walk:

enum page_walk_ret_action {
	ACTION_SUBTREE = 0,
	ACTION_CONTINUE = 1,
	ACTION_AGAIN = 2 /* Only for levels that thave p?d_unstable */
};

struct mm_walk {
	...
	enum page_walk_ret_action action; /* or perhaps as an enum */
};


if (ops->pud_entry) {
	walk->action = ACTION_SUBTREE;
	...
	...
	...
	if (walk->action == ACTION_AGAIN)  /* Callback tried to split huge entry, but failed */
		goto again;
	else if (walk->action == ACTION_CONTINUE) /* Done with this subtree. Probably huge entry handled. */
		continue;
	/* ACTION_SUBTREE falls through */
}

we discussed something similar before on linux-mm, but the idea then was to redefine
the positive return value of the callback to the action, but that meant changing those existing callbacks that relied on
a positive return value. The above would be helpful also for pmd_entry.
