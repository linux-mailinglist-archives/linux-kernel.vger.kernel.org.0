No, that's the bug since we didn't consider the side effect.

No, I do want to have difference because it's per-process hint. IOW,
what he know is for only his context, not others so it shouldn't clean
others' pte. That makes difference between LRU aging and the hint.

> understand.

It's not hard to understand.. MADV_PAGEOUT should consider only his
context since it's per-process hint(Even, he couldn't know others'
context) so it shouldn't bother others.

Actually, Dave's suggestion is correct to fix the issue if there
was no isse with side channel attack. However, due to the attack
issue, page_mapcount could prevent the problem effectively.
That's why I am not against of the patch now since it fixes
the bug as well as vulnerability.
