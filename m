I consider this a bug, but we can see what others think.
This suggests kexec-tools can open /proc/iomem, find a likely looking gap, and try to load
the new kernel between two platform devices.

I don't think there is a need to idmap memory at all. We should copy the linear map so you
know you won't overwrite its page tables as part of loading the new kernel.

Yes, all this would need doing as machine_kexec() runs. We preferably need to allocate
memory in this path, or at least have a bitmap of what we can/can't overwrite.

Hibernate maps a single executable page in ttbr0_el1 that holds its relocation code.
The relocation code then switches ttbr1_el1 to point to the copy of the linear map. See
the 'break_before_make_ttbr_switch' macro in swsusp_arch_suspend_exit().

Our kasan and hibernate code already went a different way. I doubt we can bring them back
in to look like x86, they have different problems to solve.

and is_hyp_mode_available() ?


This depends on which exception-level your bootloader set Linux running. You should get a
boot message that tells you:
| CPU: All CPU(s) started at EL2

is_kernel_in_hyp_mode() is for determining if the kernel is running at EL2. This is the
case if you get a message like:
| kvm [1]: VHE mode initialized successfully
VHE is a v8.1 feature that repaints the system-registers so a kernel written to run at EL1
can run almost unmodified at EL2.

We also have is_hyp_mode_available(), which will return true if all the CPUs booted at EL2.


kexec either runs its relocation code at EL1, or at EL2 if that is where the first kernel
booted. If you call to EL2, the MMU was already off as KVM will reset EL2 to the hyp-stub
in response to the reboot notifiers hardware_disable() call.

(kvm_arch_hardware_disable() calls cpu_hyp_reset())

Yes, if you've got a VHE system it can skip the jumping around Exception-levels, but we
still need to support the non-VHE systems.

First hit on google is [0]. Which assuming its the same SoC, says its Cortex-A72, this is
a v8.0 part, it doesn't have VHE. The kernel will be running at EL1, if it supports KVM it
must have booted at EL2.


> Because  is_kernel_in_hyp_mode()

This check is for VHE.
|static inline bool is_kernel_in_hyp_mode(void)
| {
|	return read_sysreg(CurrentEL) == CurrentEL_EL2;
| }

The kernel's early startup in head.S detects if its running at EL2 or EL1. If it has VHE,
it enables the feature and stays at EL2. Otherwise it installs the 'hyp-stub' and drops to
EL1.

On v8.0 the kernel has to run at EL1 because we need the two ttbr registers.
(kernel/user-space). EL2 on these parts only has one. v8.1's VHE adds a second ttbr to
EL2, meaning we can run linux at EL2 and KVM avoids the jumping between exception levels.


You can check for that:
| CPU: All CPU(s) started at EL2
message. If your bootloader is starting the OS at EL1, you will need to speak to the
firmware folk about getting that changed.

I assume you started at EL2. You moved EL1's mmu-off code, but cpu_soft_restart() will
call the relocation code at EL2 where the MMU is already off. Because you expected to be
using an idmap, nothing goes wrong, but nothing has changed.

James
