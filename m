FROM MR SAHILA WANAL
AUDIT& ACCOUNT MANAGER
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO
WEST AFRICA.

Dear friend,

With due respect, i have decided to contact you on a business
transaction that will be beneficial to both of us. At the bank last
account and auditing evaluation, my staffs came across an old account
which was being maintained by a foreign client who we learn was among
the deceased passengers of motor accident on november.2003, the
deceased was unable to run this account since his death. The account
has remained dormant without the knowledge of his family since it was
put in a safe deposit account in the bank for future investment by the
client.

Since his demise, even the members of his family haven't applied for
claims over this fund and it has been in the safe deposit account
until i discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client is a
foreign national and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to
file claims over the money. As the director of the department, this
discovery was brought to my office so as to decide what is to be done;
i decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out of the
bank and out of the country too.

The total amount in the account is (18.6 million) with my positions as
staffs of the bank, i am handicapped because i cannot operate foreign
accounts and cannot lay benefice claim over this money. The client was
a foreign national and you will only be asked to act as his next of
kin and i will supply you with all the necessary information and bank
data to assist you in being able to transfer this money to any bank of
your choice where this money could be transferred into. The total sum
will be shared as follows: 50% for me, 50% for you, and expenses
incidental occur during the transfer will be incur by both of us. The
transfer is risk free on both sides hence you are going to follow my
instruction till the fund transfer to your account. Since i work in
this bank that is why you should be confident in the success of this
transaction because you will be updated with information as at when
desired.

I will like you to keep this transaction as top secret and
confidential as i am hoping to retire with my share of this money at
the end of transaction which will be when this money is safety in your
Account, i will then come over to your country for sharing according
to the previously agreed percentages. You might even have to advise me
on possibilities of investment in your country or elsewhere of our
choice. May god help you to help me to a restive retirement?

Please for further information and inquires feel free to contact me
back through this my private e-mails as follows
(mrsahila46@yandex.com) immediately for more explanation and better
understanding i want you to assure me your capability of handling this
project with trust by providing me your following information details
such as:

(1) Your full name..............
(2) Your age:................
(3) Sex:.....................
(4) Your telephone number:.................
(5) Your occupation:.....................
(6) Your country:.....................

Yours sincerely,
Mr Sahila Wanal
