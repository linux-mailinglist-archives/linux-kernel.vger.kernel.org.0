I know this distinction well.

Can this tracepoint be registered on with tracepoint_probe_register()?
Quickly looking at these new tracepoint, they can be otherwise how would they
even work right? If so, then eBPF can very well access it. Look at
__bpf_probe_register() and bpf_raw_tracepoint_open() which implement the
BPF_RAW_TRACEPOINT_OPEN.

As I was mentioning, tracepoints, not "trace events" can already be opened
directly with BPF. I don't see how these new tracepoints are different.

I wonder if this distinction of "tracepoint" being non-ABI can be documented
somewhere. I would be happy to do that if there is a place for the same. I
really want some general "policy" in the kernel on where we draw a line in
the sand with respect to tracepoints and ABI :).

For instance, perhaps VFS can also start having non-ABI tracepoints for the
benefit of people tracing the VFS.
