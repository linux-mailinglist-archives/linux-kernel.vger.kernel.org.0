But in that case, running multiple activations back to back, should we
not expect the util_avg to exceed the 75% mark?

Which thus should match my expectation above, no?

Indeed, I can see from the plots a change in slope. But there is also
that big drop after the first big activation: 375 units in 1.1ms.

Is that expected? I guess yes, since we fix the clock_pelt with the
lost_idle_time.
