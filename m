Currently when new map is mmaps we set its refcnt
to 2 in perf_evlist_mmap_ops::mmap callback.

Every mmap is given refcnt set to 2 when it's first mmaped:
  - 1 for current user, which will be taken out by call to
    perf_evlist__munmap_filtered, where we find out there's
    no more data comming from kernel to this mmap
  - 1 for drain code where in perf_mmap__consume the mmap
    is released if it is empty

Moving this common setup into libperf generic code
before mmap callback is called.
