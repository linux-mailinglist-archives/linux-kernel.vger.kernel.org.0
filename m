If the bridge/panel is controlled via dsi, it will not be probed at all
if DSI host/bus is not created, so it will not work at all. Upstream
device will wait forever for downstream drm_(panel|bridge).

So IMO we just do not have choice here.

If you know better alternative let us know, otherwise we should proceed
with "drm: kirin: Fix dsi probe/attach logic" patch.

It is pity that breakage happened, and next time we should be more
strict about testing other platforms, before patch acceptance.

But reverting it now will break also platform which depend on it.

Anyway the old order was incorrect and prevented other users from adv*
driver usage, so it should be fixed anyway.

If you mean 'probe' as in initialization from component_master::bind
callback with this patch it still works, DSI-HOST calls component_add
after drm_bridge is found.

I am not familiar with efifb, if you describe the issue you have in more
detail we can try to find some solution together.
