Something we see e.g. is f2fs's gc thread, and my thought on this is
instead of chasing everything down, it is a lot easier for us to only
boost what we know in foreground (and on Android we sort of have that
information on hand from framework).
I was hesitant to introduce a new switch ( e.g. Android's older EAS
kernel prefer_idle toggle ) but would be happy to do that if someone
supports that idea.
