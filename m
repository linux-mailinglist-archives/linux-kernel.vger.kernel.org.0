In general I think it's preferrable if the hotkey sends the key event to
userspace that then makes the policy decision of what, if anything, to
do with it. Everything is much easier if the policy is in userspace
control. For example, you could define content based policies for
enabling privacy screen, something that is definitely not possible with
firmware.

I emphatize with the desire to just bypass everything at the
hardware/firmware level, because that is totally in your control (as an
OEM), and requires no interaction with the operating system
initially. Exposing the read-only state of the privacy screen is
helpful, but prevents the OS from building more advanced features on
top, failing to reach the full potential of the nice hardware feature.

That said, we obviously do need to take such hardware/firmware
implementations into account as well.

IMO one of the problems with using sysfs for this is that it's not
connected with the graphics subsystem. The userspace has to go out of
its way to make the connection between the privacy screen and the
display. It shouldn't have to. It's a property of the display, not some
unrelated device (although, technically, I presume in hardware it might
be ;).

We've made the mistake with backlight before, and we still somewhat
struggle with it. Please let's not repeat that.

I agree with Pekka's mail [1] in that thread.

BR,
