? I think this would break kprobes and perf's use of single-step on SMP systems.

(e.g. the original instruction caused a page fault)

Yes, because the original instruction hadn't run, it caused a page fault. This time its
more likely to succeed.

perf's use of arm64's breakpoints is quite happy with this. It means if you hit a
breakpoint in the fault handler, you see those too. If an instruction causes a page-fault,
you may see it twice, but that is because the CPU tried to execute it twice.

(I agree the irq case is probably just annoying for kgdb)

Are you driving the single-step hardware directly here, or using the behaviour from
breakpoint_handler() and reinstall_suspended_bps()?

These disable breakpoints and step the original instruction, then re-enable breakpoints.
This is because breakpoints fire before the instruction runs, and single-step doesn't
suppress breakpoints. This has to happen regardless of asynchronous exceptions.

Is it fair to say that the user driving kgdb is very-slow compared to IRQs firing?
This isn't true for the other consumers of single-step (kprobes, perf).

(tangent: you can't step ERET!)

This works for perf. It doesn't for kprobes, which is why kprobes blacklists those sites.

If the problem is IRQs preventing the very-slow user making forward-progress, it may be
possible for kgdb to ask the irqchip code to mute all IRQs on this CPU while it is
stepping. The PMR mechanism we use for pNMI could do this for the GIC. (Caveat: I don't
know anything about the GIC). For the pi ... no idea.

This doesn't stop you seeing instructions that fault from taking a fault, or taking the
breakpoint twice when the CPU tries to run the instruction twice. This is just the debug
hardware showing you what happened.


Thanks,

James
