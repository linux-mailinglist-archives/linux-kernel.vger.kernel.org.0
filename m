I don't post regularly here anymore, but it's good to see the code of conduct
and Linus's sabbatical have had a positive effect on the place in my absence.

No, my complaint was that kconfig basically has the concept of symbols that turn
_off_ something that is otherwise on by default ("Disable X" instead of "Enable
X"), but it was implemented it in an awkward way then allowed to scale to silly
levels, and now the fact it exists is being used as evidence that it was a good
idea.

I had to work out a way to work around this design breakage, which I did and had
moved on before this email, but I thought pointing out the awkwardness might
help a design discussion. My mistake.

The thread _started_ because menuconfig help has a blind spot (which seemed like
a bug to me, it _used_ to say why), and then I found the syntax you changed a
year or two back non-obvious when I tried to RTFM but that part got answered.

You drove everybody away who would express similar concerns years ago. None of
my co-workers have wanted to get linux-kernel on them in ages. (I thought that
sort of thing was why you were having a code of conduct and such, but apparently
not.)

*shrug* I'll try to be more proactive about stripping linux-kernel from the cc:
list once I've got a human's attention in a thread. (Or just try to dig up
somebody to email directly via git history and the maintainers file.)

I leave you to your sexual metaphors,

Rob
