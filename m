I suppose atop/sar divides delta(io_ticks) and delta(real_time)

With my patch io_tics accounts whole operation then it ends
it could be started at previous interval of atop statistics.
as a result delta(io_ticks) will be bigger than delta(real_time).

Yep. Without my patch there will be also 9 tick gap between ends.

inflight now per-cpu counter for performance reason.
request starts on one cpu and completes on another so it's hard to check exact count.

Nope. Percpu io_ticks accounts steps of single (per-partition) atomic time stamp.

	stamp = READ_ONCE(part->stamp);
	if (unlikely(stamp != now)) {
		if (likely(cmpxchg(&part->stamp, stamp, now) == stamp)) {
			__part_stat_add(part, io_ticks, end ? now - stamp : 1);
		}
	}

Yep. io_ticks is a legacy. "weighted" counters better resembles for modern parallel hardware.

Current approach emulates legacy io_ticks with minimal effort.

Right now io_ticks counts jiffies when was at least one request was started or completed.
Time between these events are not accounted. Probably it would be better to document it in this way.
