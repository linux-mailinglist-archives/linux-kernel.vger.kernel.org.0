eBPF requires newer kernel, while there're still lots of servers
running with old kernels.
The systemtap is not convenient as it requires many debug packages,
and it is still not stable enough to run on the product environment,
for example, the systemtap deamon may exit without uninstalling the
systemtap kernel module.

This seem like a good suggestion.
I will try to think about it.
