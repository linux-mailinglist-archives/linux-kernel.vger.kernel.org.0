The warning is due to kernel/sched/idle.c not updating curr->se.exec_start.

While debugging I noticed an issue with a particular load pattern.  The CPU
goes non-nohz for a brief time at an interval very close to twice=20
tick_period.  When the tick is started, the timer expiration is more than
tick_period in the past, so hrtimer_forward() tries to catch up by adding
2*tick_period to the expiration.  Then the tick is stopped before that new
expiration, and when the tick is woken up the expiry is again advanced by
2*tick_period with the timer never actually running.  sched_tick_remote()
does fire every second, but there are streaks of several seconds where it
keeps catching the CPU in a non-nohz state, so neither the normal nor remot=
e
ticks are calling calc_load_nohz_remote().

Is there a reason to not just remove the hrtimer_forward() from
tick_nohz_restart(), letting the timer fire if it's in the past, which will
take care of doing hrtimer_forward()?

As for the warning in sched_tick_remote(), it seems like a test for time
since the last tick on this cpu (remote or otherwise) would be better than
relying on curr->se.exec_start, in order to detect things like this.
