That's fine, consider indenting BRCM_RESCAL_STATUS_BIT as well, then.

Is this something that can actually happen?

Unless the bit is self-clearing, I can't see how this XOR could ever set
the bit instead of clearing it.
And even if it would, I don't understand how that can be indented.
Wouldn't that restart the reset/calibration sequence?

Thank you for the explanation. I agree the "reset and calibration
sequence" property is close enough to a pure reset sequence to warrant
describing this as as reset controller.
The correct way would be to use the .reset callback though, if you can
have the drivers use reset_control_reset().
