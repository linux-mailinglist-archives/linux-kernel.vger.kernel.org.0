Hm, isn't that what udev is supposed to do anyway? Remember that
I3C devices expose a manufacturer and part-id (which are similar to the
USB vendor and product ids), so deciding when an I3C device should be
bound to the i3cdev driver should be fairly easy, and that's a
per-device decision anyway.

Well, I'm more worried about the extra churn this auto-binding logic
might create for the common 'on-demand driver loading' use case. At
first, there's no driver matching a specific device, but userspace
might load one based on the uevents it receives. With the current
approach, that means we'd first have to unbind the device before
loading the driver. AFAICT, no other subsystem does that.
