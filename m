The real boot error "general protection fault in dma_direct_max_mapping_size" is
fixed in mainline now.  I believe that unblocks syzbot testing, since it doesn't
appear to have been blocked by "WARNING: workqueue cpumask: online intersect >
possible intersect" by itself.

Anyway: Tejun and Michael, any other ideas for why "WARNING: workqueue cpumask:
online intersect > possible intersect" is still happening?
