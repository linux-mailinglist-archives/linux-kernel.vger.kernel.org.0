I think the definition of "node online" is worth of rethinking. Before
patch "x86, numa: always initialize all possible nodes", online means
either cpu or memory present. After this patch, only node owing memory
as present.

In the commit log, I think the change's motivation should be "Not to
mention that it doesn't really make much sense to consider an empty
node as online because we just consider this node whenever we want to
iterate nodes to use and empty node is obviously not the best
candidate."

But in fact, we already have for_each_node_state(nid, N_MEMORY) to
cover this purpose. Furthermore, changing the definition of online may
break something in the scheduler, e.g. in task_numa_migrate(), where
it calls for_each_online_node.

By keeping the node owning cpu as online, Michal's patch can avoid
such corner case and keep things easy. Furthermore, if needed, the
other patch can use for_each_node_state(nid, N_MEMORY) to replace
for_each_online_node is some space.
