My apologies for the 'word salad'.

Right, I missed that.

It's test case (LTP futex_cmp_requeue01), which keeps uaddr1 value same
across requeue, and then sporadically fails to wake up some child processes=
.

It seems both I and test author missed some hint at man page
for FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE and assumed this was valid use case.

Thank you for the detailed response.
