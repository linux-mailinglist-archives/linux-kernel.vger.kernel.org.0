In my email, see that I said I actually checked out mainline kernel
(and I gave you the exact version: "v5.1-rc7-5-g83a50840e72a") and
added printouts in dwc2_port_suspend() next to where it set HPRT0_SUSP
and PCGCTL_STOPPCLK in dwc2_port_suspend().

[  454.906364] dwc2 ff540000.usb: I'm setting HPRT0_SUSP
[  454.906367] dwc2 ff540000.usb: I'm setting PCGCTL_STOPPCLK

The version "v5.1-rc7-5-g83a50840e72a" is not old code.

You are pointing me at _dwc2_hcd_suspend() whereas I pointed at
dwc2_port_suspend().  Why?

I am saying that dwc2_port_suspend() _does_ set "HPRT0_SUSP" and
"PCGCTL_STOPPCLK" even with DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE.  Do you
disagree?

I completely agree that on mainline _dwc2_hcd_suspend() _does not_ set
these bits with DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE.  That is what my patch
fixes.
