You're right. We've moved back to actually having it volatile (or
possibly never got away from it). My bad.

At one point, we tried very hard to make test_bit() perform much
better when you tested multiple bits, and I thought we ended up having
that merged and didn't want to regress. But apparently we never did
that, or it got undone.

test_bit() is a very unfortunate interface, in that we actually use it
in some situations where we _really_ would want to merge reads (not
split them, but merge them). There are several cases where we do
constant test-bits on the same word, and don't care about ordering.
Things like thread flags etc.

It's explicitly not ordered, so *merging* reads would be right and
lovely, it's the "don't read twice" that is bad. But we have no way to
tell the compiler that ;(

Anyway, READ_ONCE() is ok by me when I look at the code, because as
you say, it's already volatile (like my memory ;).
