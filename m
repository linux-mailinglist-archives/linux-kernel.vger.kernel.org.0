I usually reserve panic and BUG_ON() to last resort when data integrity is
directly threatened. But indeed I guess that's all we have for now.

If we take that path, I'd rather not call that cpu_up() and simply panic if
the given CPU happens not to be online after SMP bootup.

Yeah cpuset is going to be a usecase.

I'm going to work on that so that the boot CPU is always the housekeeper
in the beginning, then that duty can be later passed to any secondary CPU
or the whole can be rolled back. The current situation with the temporary
housekeeper that isn't a real one makes me a bit uncomfortable.

Thanks.
