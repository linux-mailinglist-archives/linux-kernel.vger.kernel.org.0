Well,

I admit I wasn't taking the approach of changing the kernel because I was 
thinking it would require a partial, or even full, revert of commit 
9c4e6b1a7027f, and that would be increasing complexity, but on a 
second thought, it seems that we might just be missing:

diff --git a/mm/swap.c b/mm/swap.c
index cf39d24ada2a..b1601228ded4 100644
--- a/mm/swap.c
+++ b/mm/swap.c
@@ -473,6 +473,7 @@ void lru_cache_add_active_or_unevictable(struct page *page,
                __mod_zone_page_state(page_zone(page), NR_MLOCK,
                                    hpage_nr_pages(page));
                count_vm_event(UNEVICTABLE_PGMLOCKED);
+               SetPageUnevictable(page);
        }
        lru_cache_add(page);
 }


I'll take a closer look into it, as well as test it properly, tomorrow. 
Thanks for the heads up, Andrew.
