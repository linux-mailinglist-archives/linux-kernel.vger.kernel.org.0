Well, 'never' as in a 'long' time.

Only twice as long. And why do we care about that?

The problem with it is though that you get the overflow at the end of
the whole period, instead of halfway through, so reconstruction is
trickier.

That's even worse. I'm still not understanding why we can't use the
normal code.

But why?!

What what? The PERF_METRICS contents depends on the FIXCTR3 value ?!
That's bloody insane. /me goes find the SDM. The SDM is bloody useless
:-(.

Please give a complete and coherent description of all of this. I can't
very well review any of this until I know how the hardware works, now
can I.

In this write-up, include the exact condition for METRICS_OVF (the SDM
states: 'it indicates that PERF_METRIC counter has overflowed', which is
gramatically incorrect and makes no sense even with the missing article
injected).
