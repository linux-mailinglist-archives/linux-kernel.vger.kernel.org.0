What I mean with "from an engineering perspective" is that drivers would 
end up with a non-trivial amount of code supporting purely academic 
cases: Setups where software rendering would be faster than gpu 
accelerated, and setups on platforms where the driver would never run 
anyway because the device would never be supported on that platform...

That is not really true. The dma API can't handle faulting of coherent 
pages which is what this series is really all about supporting also with 
SEV active. To handle the case where we move graphics buffers or send 
them to swap space while user-space have them mapped.

To do that and still be fully dma-api compliant we would ideally need, 
for example, an exported dma_pgprot(). (dma_pgprot() by the way is still 
suffering from one of the bugs that you mention above).

Still, I need a way forward and my questions weren't really answered by 
this.
