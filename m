Functionally, I'm fine with trying this. But perhaps we should check aux
and early return first, and then check what vbt says, to reduce the
dmesg noise.

I'll probably want to see a debug message if we're enabling aux
backlight even if dev_priv->vbt.backlight.type !=
INTEL_BACKLIGHT_VESA_EDP_AUX_INTERFACE. It's the kind of debug trace
you'll really want to get first.

BR,
Jani.
