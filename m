Tangentially, there might also be value in some kind of "must be 
explicitly initialised" attribute that would warn if any element was not 
covered by (at least one) initialiser. For cases like our 
icache_policy_str one, where using the "default + overrides" pattern for 
the sake of one reserved entry is more about robustness against the 
array growing in future than simpler code today, that could arguably be 
a more appropriate option.
