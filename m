Not at all, no. This is not a simplification but an extremely invasive 
proposal.

The parent-child relationship is extremely useful for power management, 
and guarantees that the PCI device remains on while one or more of the 
masters are used, and conversely can suspend when all links are idle. I 
currently don't need to do anything, it's all taken care of by the 
framework.

If I have to do all the power management at the PCI device level, then I 
will need to keep track of which links are currently active. All these 
links are used independently, so it's racy as hell to keep track of the 
usage when the pm framework already does so quite elegantly. You really 
want to use the pm_runtime_get/put refcount for each master device, not 
manage them from the PCI level.

I might add that I don't see the logic in having pm support at the Slave 
device level, but not at the master, and again at the PCI level. It's 
just simpler to handle pm at each level rather that fudge layers.

I would also remind you that the solution you developed while at Intel 
did in fact use the parent-child relationship for power management, and 
I remember very clearly having discussions with you on this. I don't see 
why replacing platform devices by master devices should change this 
design choice.

No. The links can only be resumed when the DSP is fully powered. We've 
tried all sorts of optimizations already and worked with the hardware 
team on this.

I will flip the argument: you can implement a lightweight master driver 
in no time. All you need is to move the code you currently have in the 
platform device .probe() to the master_device .probe(). Big deal, the 
overhead is negligible - and you don't need to add pm_ops if you don't 
need to.

I would add that you cannot possibly compare the two implementations.

Qualcomm has an extremely simple SoundWire link optimized for 2 PDM 
amplifiers connected to a SLIMbus codec, with a fixed bit allocation. 
There is currently no power management for this link.

Intel has 4 links running in parallel and synchronized in hardware, with 
complicated power management, different flavors of clock-stop - some not 
controlled by the driver but by DSP firmware - , 5 hardware 
configurations (more coming) and 6 third-party devices (more coming).

You've got to give us some slack here, and leave us handle power 
management in the simplest possible way.
