What software is that?

Yes we have a proper syscall for endian switching, sys_switch_endian(),
which is definitely supported.

But that *only* switches the endian-ness of the process, it does nothing
to the syscall layer. So any process that switches to the other endian
must endian flip syscall arguments (that aren't in registers), or flip
back to the native endian before calling syscalls.

Sure. We'll see if anyone else speaks up.
