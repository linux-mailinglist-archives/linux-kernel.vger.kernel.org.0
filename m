I'll look at this since I'm already resending due to the merge conflict.

Sure, the DP phy is technically always there, but does a particular 
platform have an actual DP output connected to the phy?  If not, why 
bother describing something that isn't even used?

 From a more practical sense its undefined how to actually get the DP 
clocks - the DP binding is implicitly a clock provider since it has 
#clock-cells, but it doesn't specify how to actually get the clocks. 
The DSI binding tells you which index is the dsi clock, and which is the 
byte clock.

The HDMI binding is not a clock provider at all.  Needs to be revised, 
which didn't appear trivial when I took a quick look while working on mmcc.

I want to do the right thing here by specifying all the external clocks 
up front, and not have to worry about backwards compatibility with 
pre-existing DTs later on, but I also would like to focus on one problem 
at a time, and not go dig into all the problems with DP/HDMI before 
landing this, particularly as those components also rely on the mmcc.

Is that justification enough for you?  If not, how would you like to 
proceed?  Make them required in the binding, and just have an invalid 
(per the binding) DT until all the problems get sorted out?
