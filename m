Yes it will.

Though hopefully by now we're all well aware that speed and security 
being inversely proportional is the universal truth of modern computing.

Coherent DMA already works in PAGE_SIZE units under the covers (at least 
in the DMA API implementations relevant here) - that's not an issue. The 
problem is streaming DMA, where we have to give the device access to, 
say, some pre-existing 64-byte data packet, from right in the middle of 
who knows what else. Since we do not necessarily have control over the 
who knows what else, the only universally-practical way to isolate the 
DMA data is to copy it away to some safe sanitised page which we *do* 
control, and make the actual DMA accesses target that.

Where, since we can't easily second-guess users' systems, "the driver" 
turns out to be every DMA-capable driver, every subsystem-level buffer 
manager, every userspace application which could possibly make use of 
some kind of zero-copy I/O call...

Compared to a single effectively-transparent implementation in a single 
place at the lowest level with a single switch for the user to turn it 
on or off depending on how security-critical their particular system is, 
I know which approach I'd rather review, maintain and rely on.
