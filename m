It seems like what's happening is that the Exynos port/phy nodes are
mistaken for standard USB device nodes attached to the root hub.  The
problem is that hub port numbering starts at 1 while the Exynos nodes
start from 0.  This causes attached devices to be associated with the
wrong DT node.

Ignoring backwards compatibility, I can see a few ways of fixing this:

- Add another child node, along side the port@N nodes, of the host
  controller to represent the root hub.  Nodes for attached devices
  would then be descendants of this new node.

- Change the Exynos HCD binding to use a more standard "phys" property
  and get rid of the child nodes for this purpose.

- Move the port@N nodes below a new dedicated child node of the HCD.

The first is probably the easiest to implement since it doesn't require
any nasty hacks to avoid breaking existing device trees.
