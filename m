Well yeah, but that's only if you have a reason to suspect there's some data
you care about.  I'd say that in the usual case, saving whatever volatile
state the system has tends to be not worth risking corruption.

Ie, the default advice for a locked-up system should be SysRq B.

Is there some other wording that you would be happier with?
