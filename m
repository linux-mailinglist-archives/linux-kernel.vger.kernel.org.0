The problem which this patch addresses has apparently gone unreported for 
4+ years since

    mm/thp: allocate transparent hugepages on local node

My goal is to reach a solution that does not cause anybody to incur 
performance penalties as a result of it.  It's surprising that such a 
severe swap storm issue that went unnoticed for four years is something 
that can't reach an amicable solution that doesn't cause other users to 
regress.

(1) The totality of kernel users are not running workloads that span 
multiple sockets, it's the minority, (2) it's changing 4+ year behavior 
based on NUMA locality of hugepage allocations and provides no workarounds 
for users who incur regressions as a result, and (3) does not solve the 
underlying issue if remote memory is also fragmented or low on memory: it 
actually makes the problem worse.

The easiest solution would be to define the MADV_HUGEPAGE behavior 
explicitly in sysfs: local or remote.  Defaut to local as the behavior 
from the past four years and allow users to specify remote if their 
workloads will span multiple sockets.  This is somewhat coarse but no more 
than the thp defrag setting in sysfs today that defines defrag behavior 
for everybody on the system.
