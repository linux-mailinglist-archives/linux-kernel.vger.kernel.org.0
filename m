This is still too vague to be useful in any way.

Well, considering that per page priority is a no go as already pointed
out by Willy then you do not have other choice right?

This doesn't really answer my question. Why cannot you use memcgs as
they are now. Why exactly do you need a fixed priority?

This doesn't answer my question.

No, this is not an answer.
