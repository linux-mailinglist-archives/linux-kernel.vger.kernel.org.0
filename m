On a standard pc (like the ones emulated by qemu) that is the case.
It's different on !x86, it also changes with a iommu being present.

But that is not the main point here.  The point is the dma master
address already has a definition and you can't simply change that.

Sure.

Also note that dma address space is device-specific.  In case a iommu
is present in the system you can have *multiple* dma address spaces,
separating (groups of) devices from each other.  So passing a dma
address from one device to another isn't going to work.

What exactly?

But it might lead to taking virtio-specific (or virtualization-specific)
shortcuts which will hurt in the long run ...

Yes.  But that DMA address is already defined by the platform, you can't
freely re-define it.  Well, you sort-of can when you design your own
virtual iommu for qemu.  But even then you can't just pass around magic
cookies masqueraded as dma address.  You have to make sure they actually
form an address space, without buffers overlapping, ...

So you probably have some virtio-video-decoder.  You allocate a gpu
buffer, export it as dma-buf, import it into the decoder, then let the
video decoder render to it.  Right?

Using dmabufs makes sense for sure.  But we need an separate field in
struct dma_buf for an (optional) host dmabuf identifier, we can't just
hijack the dma address.

cheers,
