A warning like that makes sense to me.

And if you try to change the Ubuntu default to python3, some things break 
there (I did that last month using alternates on Ubuntu 19.10 - had to 
revert back to python2).

Actually, virtualenv support was added later ;-)

The script supports both virtualenv and distro package install, although
the current default is to use virtualenv. You can force it to recommend the
distro package with:

	$ ./scripts/sphinx-pre-install --no-virtualenv
	Detected OS: Fedora release 30 (Thirty).

	ERROR: please install "python-sphinx", otherwise, build won't work.
	Warning: better to also install "sphinx_rtd_theme".
	You should run:

		sudo dnf install -y python3-sphinx python3-sphinx_rtd_theme

	Can't build as 1 mandatory dependency is missing at ./scripts/sphinx-pre-install line 721.

The main reason why virtualenv is the default is that we need to
ensure a certain minimal version (nowadays, it is recommended at least 1.7.9). 
If one is using a LTS distro, the distro-package could be older than that.

With virtualenv, it is easier to fulfill the minimal version (and the
recommended one). You may even have multiple Sphinx versions, with is
quite useful when trying to identify if the html and/or pdf output
is doing the right thing with different toolchain versions.

Thanks,
Mauro
