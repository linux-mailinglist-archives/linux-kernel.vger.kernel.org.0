But note that it checks "condition" after prepare_to_wait_event(), if it is
true then ___wait_is_interruptible() won't be even called.

If we were already removed from the list and condition is true, we can't
miss it, ret =3D -ERESTARTSYS won't be used. This is what this part of the
comment above

=09 * The caller will recheck the condition and return success if
=09 * we were already woken up, we can not miss the event because
=09 * wakeup locks/unlocks the same wq_head->lock.

tries to explain.

list_del_init() ensures that wake_up() can't pick this task after
prepare_to_wait_event() returns.

IOW. Suppose that ___wait_event() races with

=09condition =3D true;
=09wake_up();

if wake_up() happens before prepare_to_wait_event(), __wait_event() will
see condition =3D=3D true, -ERESTARTSYS returned by prepare_to_wait_event()=
 has
no effect.

If wake_up() comes after prepare_to_wait_event(), the task was already remo=
ved
from the list, another exclusive waiter (if any) will be woken up. In this =
case
__wait_event() can return success or -ERESTARTSYS, both are correct.

No?

Oleg.
