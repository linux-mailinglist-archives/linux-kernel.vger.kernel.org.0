No, it does not warn for this.

I've tried a few more variants here: https://godbolt.org/z/ykSX0r

What I think is going on here is a result of clang and gcc fundamentally
treating -Wuninitialized warnings differently. gcc tries to make the warnings
as helpful as possible, but given the NP-complete nature of this problem
it won't always get it right, and it traditionally allowed this syntax as a
workaround.

int f(void)
{
    int i = i; // tell gcc not to warn
    return i;
}

clang apparently implements the warnings in a way that is as
completely predictable (and won't warn in cases that it
doesn't completely understand), but decided as a result that the
gcc 'int i = i' syntax is bogus and it always warns about a variable
used in its own declaration that is later referenced, without looking
at whether the declaration does initialize it or not.

Yes, makes sense.

Would it make you feel better to keep the current code but have an alternative
version guarded with e.g. "#if defined(__clang__ && (__clang_major__ <= 9)"?

While it is probably a good idea to fix clang here, this is one of the last
issues that causes a significant difference between gcc and clang in build
testing with kernelci:
https://kernelci.org/build/next/branch/master/kernel/next-20190709/
I'm trying to get all the warnings fixed there so we can spot build-time
regressions more easily.
