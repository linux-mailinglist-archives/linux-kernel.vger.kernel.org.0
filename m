Well, TBH I have missed this change. My bad. I have mostly checked that
the WARN_ONCE is not gated by the check and didn't expect more changes.
But I have likely missed that change in the previous version already.
You guys are too quick with new version to my standard.

Anyway, I do agree that bool is clumsy here. Returning false on success
is just head scratching. Nobody really consumes the errno value but I
would just leave it that way or if there is a strong need to change then
do it in a separate patch.
