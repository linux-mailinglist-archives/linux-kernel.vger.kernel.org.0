yes.

That makes sense to me. This also makes sure we don't break other (non
mesa using) stuff accidentally. We have

  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/d817f2c69615cf37b78f484a25b7831ebe9dbe6f

and

  https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/merge_requests/3534

to normalize nsec to [0..999999999] now.
