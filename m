Hi Lukas,

Thanks for the update on this.

While the story is interesting, it doesn't really belong to a commit 
message.
Please trim it down to something along the lines of:

- The RPi bootloader is a bit crap, as it leaves IRQs and FIQs enabled
   and for the OS to deal with the consequences

- The kernel driver is not great either, as it doesn't properly 
initialize
   the interrupt state, resulting in both IRQ and FIQ misfiring and 
resulting
   in bizarre behaviours

- Properly initializing the irqchip fixes the issue. Add a couple a 
warnings
   for a good measure, so that people realize their favourite toy comes 
with
   sub-par SW.

It otherwise looks good. You can either resend it with a fixed commit 
message,
or provide me with a commit message that I can stick there while 
applying it.

Thanks,
