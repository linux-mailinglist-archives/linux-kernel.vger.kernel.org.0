I think some sort of AHB clk is always enabled so the plan is to just
hand back NULL to the caller when they call clk_get() on it and nobody
should be the wiser when calling clk APIs with a NULL iface clk. The
common clk APIs typically just return 0 and move along. Of course, we'll
also turn the clk on in the clk driver so that hardware can function
properly, but we don't need to expose it as a clk object and all that
stuff if we're literally just slamming a bit somewhere and never looking
back.

But it sounds like we can't return NULL for this clk for some reason? I
haven't tried to track it down yet but I think Matthias has found it
causes some sort of problem in the display driver.
