So there appear to be 89 patches with Originally-by in the entire Git
history, which isn't a a lot; there are 3x as many Co-developed-by tags,
which still isn't a huge number.  I do wonder if it's worth recognizing
yet another tag with a subtly different shade of meaning here?  My own
opinion doesn't matter a lot, but I'd like to have a sense that there is
wider acceptance of this tag before adding it to the docs.

Thanks,

jon
