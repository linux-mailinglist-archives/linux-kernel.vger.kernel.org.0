We developed livepatches to add the necessary support. I understand we
aren't the typical Linux user. We do custom development and validation
to support our use case.

That said, we very much rely on late microcode loading and it has helped
us and our customers significantly.

It's really easy to say "fix your infrastructure" when you're not
running that infrastructure.

Reboots suck. Customers hate it. Operations hates it. When you get into
the number of hosts we have, you run into all kinds of weird failure
scenarios. (What do you mean that the NIC that was working just fine
before the reboot is no longer seen on the PCI bus?)

The more reboots we can avoid, the better it is for us and our
customers.

I understand that it could be unsafe to late load some rare microcode
updates (theoretical or not). However, that is certainly the exception.
We have done this multiple times on our fleet and we plan to continue
doing so in the future.

There just aren't any good alternatives currently.
