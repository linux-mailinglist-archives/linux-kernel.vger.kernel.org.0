Hmm, so I see

+       if (!(fc & FEATURE_CONTROL_SGX_LE_WR)) {
+               pr_info_once("sgx: The launch control MSRs are not writable\n");
+               goto err_msrs_rdonly;

which clears only X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC but leaves the other three feature
bits set?!

If you'd want to disable SGX then you'd need to jump to the
err_unsupported label and get rid of the err_msrs_rdonly one.

Or am I missing something?

Right.

Ok. We want them writable.

That's fine. The question is, would OEMs leave the hash MSRs writable?

If, as you say above, we clear SGX feature bit - not only
X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC - when the MSRs are not writable, then we're fine.
Platforms sticking their own hash in there won't be supported but I
guess their aim is not to be supported in Linux anyway.

I wouldn't be too surprised if this happened. BIOS is very inventive.

This is exactly what I'm afraid of. The OEM vendors locking this down.

Yeah, we're mentally prepared for the feature bit space explosion. :)
