I do not understand this. The head could get reused only after
head_id was replaced with the following valid node.
The next cycle is done with a new id that should be valid.

Of course, the new ID might get reused as well. But then we just
repeat the cycle. We have to be able to find a valid head after
few cycles. The last valid ID could not get reused because nodes
can be removed only if was not the last valid node.

I do not understand this either. The above paragraph seems to
describe a race. I do not see how it could cause an infinite loop.
