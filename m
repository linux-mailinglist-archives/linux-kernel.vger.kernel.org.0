memblock_start_of_DRAM() won't work here, as it returns the actual start of
the DRAM including NOMAP regions. Moreover, as we cannot mark a region
NOMAP inside for_each_memblock() this should be done beforehand.

I think something like this could work:

diff --git a/arch/arm/mm/mmu.c b/arch/arm/mm/mmu.c
index 2f0f07e..f2b635b 100644
--- a/arch/arm/mm/mmu.c

 	 */
 	vmalloc_limit = (u64)(uintptr_t)vmalloc_min - PAGE_OFFSET + PHYS_OFFSET;
 
+	/*
+	 * The first usable region must be PMD aligned. Mark its start
+	 * as MEMBLOCK_NOMAP if it isn't
+	 */
+	for_each_memblock(memory, reg) {
+		if (!memblock_is_nomap(reg) && (reg->base % PMD_SIZE)) {
+			phys_addr_t size = PMD_SIZE - (reg->base % PMD_SIZE);
+
+			memblock_mark_nomap(reg->base, size);
+			break;
+		}
+	}
+
 	for_each_memblock(memory, reg) {
 		phys_addr_t block_start = reg->base;
 		phys_addr_t block_end = reg->base + reg->size;
