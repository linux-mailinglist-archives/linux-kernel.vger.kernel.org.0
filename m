Right. Actually came to the same conclusion with the same naming for IP,SP mask :)

If --user-regs is specified jointly with --call-graph dwarf option then
--user-regs already serves as the --force and, IMHO, a warning does the best.

The ideal solution, I could imagine, is to also dynamically calculate regs 
set extension and provide it in the warning, but it is only for two registers.

So, if --call-graph dwarf --user-regs=A,B,C are specified jointly then
"
WARNING: The use of --call-graph=dwarf may require all the user registers, 
specifying a subset with --user-regs may render DWARF unwinding unreliable,
so the minimal registers set (IP, SP) is explicitly forced.
"
The message is precise and it would fit the majority of use cases.
Final decision is up to you.
