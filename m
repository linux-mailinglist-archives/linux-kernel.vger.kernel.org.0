Did you mean avoids calling *set_next_task()* while we're in put_prev_task()?

So what you're saying is that put_prev_task_{rt,dl}() could drop the rq_lock()
too and the race could happen while we're inside these functions, correct? Or
is it a different reason?

By the way, is all reads/writes to ->on_cpu happen when a lock is held? Ie: we
don't need to use any smp read/write barriers?
