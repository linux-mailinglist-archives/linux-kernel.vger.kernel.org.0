I see. Then this patch #1 doesn't make sense.

So in the next version, can I remove the patch #1, change the patch #2 as
follows, and keep the patch #3?

It's a waste for the four X86_FEATURE_CQM_* features to occupy two
pure feature bits words. To better utilize feature words, re-define
word 11 to host scattered features and move the four X86_FEATURE_CQM_*
features into Linux defined word 11. More scattered features can be added
in word 11 in the future.

Leaf 11 in cpuid_leafs is renamed as CPUID_LNX_4 to reflect it's a Linux
defined leaf.

Although word 12 doesn't have any feature now, leaf 12 in cpuid_leafs
still needs to be kept because cpuid_leafs must have NCAPINTS leafs.
Rename leaf 12 as CPUID_DUMMY which will be replaced by a meaningful name
in the next patch when CPUID.7.1:EAX occupies world 12.

KVM doesn't support resctrl now. So it's safe to move the
X86_FEATURE_CQM_* features to scattered features word 11 for KVM.
