I am a little confused how this hypothetical PD controller would look
with regards to the ACPI table. Would it still have an OperationRegion
for the MMIO address of the controllers mailbox? Would the _CRS point
to the MMIO of the mailbox directly or would it still use physical
memory? If it is pointing to the MMIO mailbox is the _DSM essentially
a noop?

The problem is that with our UCSI implementation in coreboot the 48
byte mailbox sometimes is in the same page as memory that gets
memremap()ed as write-back before the ucsi driver is loaded and when
it is loaded the ioremap fails.
