I don't follow?

I don't think chosen is the right place to put all the partition
information. It's not something the bootloader configures.

This suffers from the same issue I have with the original proposal. It
will not work for existing s/w. There's only 1 logical partition that
concatenated. The rest of the partitions shouldn't need any special
handling. So we really only need some way to say 'link these 2
partitions into 1 logical partition'. Though perhaps one could want to
combine any number of physical partitions into logical partitions, but
then none of the proposals could support that. Then again, maybe
that's a userspace problem like with disks.

To throw out another option, what if the first device contains the
complete partitions for both devices with some property in one or both
devices pointing to the other device? That would make the partitions
in the 1st device still accessible to existing s/w (unless it bounds
checks the partitions).
