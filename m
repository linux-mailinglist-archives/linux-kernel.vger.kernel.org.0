I think we've been discussing 2 topics simultaneously, one is the state machine that accepts/rejects mmap/mprotect requests, while the other is where is the best place to put it. I think we have an agreement on the former, and IMO option #2 and #3 differ only in the latter.

Option #2 keeps the state machine inside SGX subsystem, so it could reuse existing data structures for page tracking/locking to some extent. Sean may have smarter ideas, but it looks to me like the existing 'struct sgx_encl_page' tracks individual enclave pages while the FSM states apply to ranges. So in order *not* to test page by page in mmap/mprotect, I guess some new range oriented structures are still necessary. But I don't think it very important anyway. 

My major concern is more from the architecture/modularity perspective. Specifically, the state machine is defined by LSM but SGX does the state transitions. That's a brittle relationship that'd break easily if the state machine changes in future, or if different LSM modules want to define different FSMs (comprised of different set of states and/or triggers). After all, what's needed by the SGX subsystem is just the decision, not the FSM definition. I think we should take a closer look at this area once Sean's patch comes out.
