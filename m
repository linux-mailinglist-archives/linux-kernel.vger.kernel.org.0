Sorry I should clarify that this is the behavior with MREMAP_FIXED is
used, and to expand on that, it would potentially even have unmapped
the region at the destination address and then fail in vma_to_resize
too, so I hope that explains why that check landed there. But should
these situations be considered a bug?
