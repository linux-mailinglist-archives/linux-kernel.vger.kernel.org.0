Roman,

Sorry, I can't agree with this patch. And even the changelog doesn't
look right.

ptrace_signal() looks fine in that the task can't return to user-mode,
get_signal() will be called again exactly because ->frozen == 1 means
TIF_SIGPENDING. So I an not surre I understand why ptrace_signal() does
ptrace_stop(false) with your patch. But this is minor.

IMHO, the real problem is not that syscall was interrupted. The problem
is that a frozen task must never start the syscall.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can't we add the unconditional leave_frozen() into ptrace_stop() for now ?

Sure, this is not what we want. Debugger can disturb CGRP_FROZEN.

But. The "may_remain_frozen" argument uglifies this code too much (imo) and
at the same time it doesn't solve the problem above: CGRP_FROZEN can be cleared
"for no reason".

Say, why ptrace_event_pid() should do leave_frozen(true) ? And if there is any
reason, then why wait_for_vfork_done() can do leave_frozen(false) ?

Or syscall-exit path. It can't miss get_signal(), it doesn't need leave_frozen().


In short, I believe that compared to the unconditional leave_frozen() in ptrace_stop()
this patch buys almost nothing, but makes the code and the whole logic much uglier.

Oleg.
