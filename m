As explained in my response to Peter, I found that resource like swap
space were depleted even after the exit of the offending program in a
mostly idle system. This patch is to make sure that those resources get
freed after program exit ASAP.

OK, if that is the case, I will need to find an alternative way to
determine if an mm is to be freed soon and perhaps set a flag to
indicate that.

Thanks,
