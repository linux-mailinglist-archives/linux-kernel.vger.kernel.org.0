I still don't like the idea to enforce either a strict dynamic
IOMMU mapping or an identify mapping mode.

Can we add a new AUTO domain which will allow using the identity
mapping when available?  That somewhat matches the existing x86
default, and also what powerpc does.  I have a series to lift
that bypass mode into the core dma-mapping code that I need
to repost, which I think would be suitable for intel-iommu as well.
