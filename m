Disagreed.

You can say you want to enforce "something" without LSM. But what's the purpose of that "something" without LSM? Why doesn't the original mprotect() enforce that "something"?

It *does* affect functionality because user mode code has to figure out an "explicit protection" to make sure the enclave would work with *and also* without LSM. That said, the "explicit protection" can neither be too restrictive (or enclave wouldn't work) nor be too permissive (or LSM policies are violated). But what if the user mode code doesn't have appropriate "explicit protection" ahead of time as it is just going to mprotect() as the enclave requests at runtime?

And your restrictions on mmap()'ing non-existing pages also have great impacts to SGX2 support.

I think some reasonable answers are needed to the above questions before we can call this proposal viable.
