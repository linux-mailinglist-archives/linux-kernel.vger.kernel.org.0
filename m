The patch

   regulator: Convert gpio-regulator to json-schema

has been applied to the regulator tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regulator.git for-5.3

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

-GPIO controlled regulators

-Required properties:

-			  here.
-- gpios			: Array of one or more GPIO pins used to select the

-- states		: Selection of available voltages/currents provided by

-
-Optional properties:
-- enable-gpios		: GPIO used to enable/disable the regulator.
-			  Warning, the GPIO phandle flags are ignored and the

-- enable-active-high	: Polarity of "enable-gpio" GPIO is active HIGH.
-			  Default is active LOW.
-- gpios-states		: On operating systems, that don't support reading back
-			  gpio values in output mode (most notably linux), this
-			  array provides the state of GPIO pins set when
-			  requesting them from the gpio controller. Systems,
-			  that are capable of preserving state when requesting
-			  the lines, are free to ignore this property.
-			  0: LOW, 1: HIGH. Default is LOW if nothing else

-- startup-delay-us	: Startup time in microseconds.
-- regulator-type	: Specifies what is being regulated, must be either
