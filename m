I'm quite lost in the sea of new macros that have been added to help
with KCSAN.  It doesn't help that they're in -next somewhere that I
can't find, and not in mainline yet.  Is there documentation somewhere?

I probably am.  An XArray is composed of a tree of xa_nodes:

struct xa_node {
        unsigned char   shift;          /* Bits remaining in each slot */
        unsigned char   offset;         /* Slot offset in parent */
        unsigned char   count;          /* Total entry count */
        unsigned char   nr_values;      /* Value entry count */
        struct xa_node __rcu *parent;   /* NULL at top of tree */
        struct xarray   *array;         /* The array we belong to */
        union {
                struct list_head private_list;  /* For tree user */
                struct rcu_head rcu_head;       /* Used when freeing node */
        };
        void __rcu      *slots[XA_CHUNK_SIZE];
        union {
                unsigned long   tags[XA_MAX_MARKS][XA_MARK_LONGS];
                unsigned long   marks[XA_MAX_MARKS][XA_MARK_LONGS];
        };
};

'shift' is initialised before the node is inserted into the tree.
Ditto 'offset'.  'count' and 'nr_values' should only be touched with the
xa_lock held.  'parent' might be modified with the lock held and an RCU
reader expecting to see either the previous or new value.  'array' should
not change once the node is inserted.  private_list is, I believe, only
modified with the lock held.  'slots' may be modified with the xa_lock
held, and simultaneously read by an RCU reader.  Ditto 'tags'/'marks'.

The RCU readers are prepared for what they see to be inconsistent --
a fact of life when dealing with RCU!  So in a sense, yes, there is a
race there.  But it's a known, accepted race, and that acceptance is
indicated by the fact that the RCU lock is held.  Does there need to be
more annotation here?  Or is there an un-noticed bug that the tool is
legitimately pointing out?
