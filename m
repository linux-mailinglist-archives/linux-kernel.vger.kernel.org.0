I looked at the of_ drivers are it became apparent that the driver calls
were already available for consumption. Adding ima specific code will be
same as adding wrapper code for any other property. Which is true for
all properties, effectively setting the property name and pass through
for other parameters.

I still like to move both implementations to a arch independent code 
path, i could not convince my self that of_*ima is probably the place, 
but if that's the best place?, then i will go ahead and make that change 
as well.

Regarding using two properties, it just seemed more consistent how the
properties(start-end) are being used in the kexec, and hides the inner 
details for the cell structures, thats all.

Its just the placement of the wrapper functions, but once thats done
both archs will call the same.

Thanks,
Prakhar Srivastava
