It does matter, since you don't want to accidentally clear the dirty
bit when you are migrating the page from the wrong perspective.
Treating pages with dirty c-bits as dirty pages should solve this
problem. It's probably reasonable to expect userspace to handle this?
Downside is that you would then need ~3 copies of the c-bit tracking
buffer: one as the kernel version, one as the "old" usermode version,
and one as the "current" usermode version (which is smaller, since you
can fetch smaller sections than the full buffer). The kernel could
probably directly twiddle the dirty tracking bits and avoid the extra
userspace version, but this doesn't seem required.

That said, this does balloon the c-bit tracking overhead. Tracking
100GB of guest pages requires 3MB per instance of these buffers, which
isn't that bad but also isn't free (assuming my back of the envelope
math is right).
