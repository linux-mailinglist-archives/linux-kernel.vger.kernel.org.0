For this particular case, it can't be done, because:

1) this machine has 10 NUMA nodes, and each NVMe has 8 hw queues, so too
many CPUs are assigned to the 1st two hw queues, see the code branch of
'if (numvecs <= nodes)' in __irq_build_affinity_masks().

2) then less CPUs are assigned to the other 6 hw queues

3) finally same effective CPU is shared by two IRQ vector.

Also looks matrix_find_best_cpu_managed() has been doing well enough for
choosing best effective CPU.


Thanks,
Ming
