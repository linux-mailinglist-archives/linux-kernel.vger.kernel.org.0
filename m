GFP_ATOMIC can access to reserved memory whereas GFP_NOWAIT is not
eligible to do so. So there is difference between them :)

Yes, we can add it before doing synchronize_rcu(). WARN_ON_ONCE() will
emit only once the warning. I think that would be enough to pay an
attention.

We can also add __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL to GFP_ATOMIC to make it more tight.
Basically your patch can be modified just adding that.

As discussed before, we can make use of memory pool API for such
purpose. But i am not sure if it should be one pool per CPU or
one pool per NR_CPUS, that would contain NR_CPUS * N pre-allocated
blocks.

I think that makes sense :)
