Yes, the hot memory is likely to be referenced but the point was an
unexpected latency because of the major fault. I have to say that I have
underestimated the issue because I was not aware of runtimes mentioned
in the referenced links. Essentially a lot of CoW memory shared over
security domains.

I am not sure this is much more helpful without a larger context. I
would stick with the wording unless you insist.

Thanks for the review.
