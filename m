arm64 output shouldn't change. I've confirmed that "efi_page_tables" is
identical on a Juno before/after the change. "kernel_page_tables"
obviously will vary depending on the exact layout of memory, but the
format isn't changed.

x86 output does change due to patch 14. In this case the change is
removing the lines from the output of the form...

...which are unpopulated areas of the memory map. Populated lines which
have attributes are unchanged.
