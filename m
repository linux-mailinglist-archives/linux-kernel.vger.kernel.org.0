Hello,

This series adds reset controllers for the Realtek RTD1295 and RTD1195 SoCs.

v2 adopts reset-simple driver and DesignWare bindings as simplification
and covers RTD1195, too.

Note that reset-simple driver would allow to cover RTD1195's reset1-3 in one
DT node, but it only maps the first resource, so RTD1295's reset4 would need
to remain separate due to a gap in between. I've therefore left them all as
separate nodes for now.

Also note that my initial 32-bit arm patch already selects RESET_CONTROLLER,
to avoid needing a separate patch here to add that one line as done for arm64.

If I can take the bindings patches through the Realtek tree then I can squash
the two final DT patches depending on them into the patches added the resets,
otherwise they need to go into v5.6 or be merged via a topic branch.

More experimental patches at:
https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commits/rtd1295-next

Have a lot of fun!

Cheers,
Andreas

v1 -> v2:
* Drop custom reset driver
* Drop "realtek,rtd1295-reset" binding
* Reordered to not depend on irqchip or clk patches
* Extended with RTD1195 patches
