Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: hisilicon: Switch to SPDX header
Date:   Tue, 11 Jun 2019 09:20:09 +0200
Message-Id: <20190611072009.2978447-1-lkundrak@v3.sk>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.21.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The original license text had a typo ("publishhed") which would be
likely to confuse automated licensing auditing tools. Let's just switch
to SPDX instead of fixing the wording.
