The use cases I'm most familiar with could have a use for key measurement 
for something like enterprise Wi-Fi root certificates. I'm not sure of the 
best way to uniquely identify a key to measure in that scenario, it could 
be anchored in various ways (process, session, thread, or user keyrings, 
for example) and may be owned by a non-root user. As Lakshmi noted above, 
key names are not unique, and I'll add that namespace considerations may 
come in to play too.

Keys (including keyrings like .builtin_trusted_keys, .ima, etc) can be 
linked to multiple keyrings, maybe you could create a system-level 
.ima_measured keyring. You could measure keys that are accessible from 
that keyring, and opt in more keys for measurement by linking them to 
.ima_measured or a keyring nested within .ima_measured.
