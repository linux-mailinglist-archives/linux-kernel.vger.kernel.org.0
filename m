Why do you think it is OK to remove that list_empty check?  I don't
think it is.  There might be locked requests that need to be woken up.

As the problem here is a use-after-free due to a race, one option would
be to use rcu_free() on the file_lock, and hold rcu_read_lock() around
test/use.

Another option is to use a different lock.  The fl_wait contains a
spinlock, and we have wake_up_locked() which is provided for exactly
these sorts of situations where the wake_up call can race with a thread
waking up.

So my compile-tested-only proposal is below.
I can probably a proper change-log entry if you think the patch is a
good way to go.
