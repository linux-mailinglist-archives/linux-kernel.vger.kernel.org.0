If you want to leave clients to call ACTIVE and WAKE requests
separately for now, then please change your patch ("soc: qcom: rpmh:
Update dirty flag only when data changes"), which (from v13) has this
in cache_rpm_request():

switch (state) {
  case RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE:
  case RPMH_WAKE_ONLY_STATE:
    req->wake_val =3D cmd->data;

...that bit of code is what led me to request that you document that
setting the active-only state also sets the wake-only state, so either
change that code or add the documentation.

OK, I guess this stems from me not understanding solver mode.  I guess
for now it's unlikely to cause problems given the current usage, so we
can ignore for now.

"Need" is perhaps too strong of a word if I understand things.  The
example above would still work even if we didn't check "sleep =3D=3D wake"
it would just program an extra (but pointless) command.  Right?

...but I guess we can debate about it later.  For now I'm not aware of
anyone setting WAKE to something other than ACTIVE.
