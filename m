Thanks for reminding. Yes, I remembered nr_scanned would double slab 
pressure. But, when I inspected into the code yesterday, it turns out it 
is not true anymore. I will run some test to make sure it doesn't 
introduce regression.

BTW, I noticed the counter of memory reclaim is not correct with THP 
swap on vanilla kernel, please see the below:

pgsteal_kswapd 21435
pgsteal_direct 26573329
pgscan_kswapd 3514
pgscan_direct 14417775

pgsteal is always greater than pgscan, my patch could fix the problem.

Anyway, I will elaborate these in the commit log.
