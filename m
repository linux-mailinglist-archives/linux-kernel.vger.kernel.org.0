You can just do a regular build rule:

obj-$(CONFIG_PSTORE_BLK) += blkzone.o

Okay, let's leave it as-is for now.

Okay, can you add comments to distinguish the on-disk structures from
the in-memory, etc?

That's fine; just add a comment to say so.

Patch 6 is excellent; I think you might want to add references back to
these kern-doc structures using the ".. kernel-doc::
fs/pstore/blkzone.c" syntax:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/doc-guide/kernel-doc.html#including-kernel-doc-comments

But there could be multiple writers; locking should be needed.

Hmm. I'll need to double-check this. It's possible the call to
persistent_ram_zap() in ramoops_pstore_erase() is not needed.

Okay. Please add some comments here. I would think of it more as "read"
or "load". When I think of "recover" I think of "finding something that
was lost". But the name isn't important as long as there is a comment
somewhere about what it's doing.
