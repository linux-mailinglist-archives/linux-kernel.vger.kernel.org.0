Ok, so I was using an old syzbot kernel from when this was first
reported and apparently hit a second issue which had since been fixed by
Alan.

I was starring at usb-next and couldn't see how it was possible to
trigger this, but that code had Alan's fix 303911cfc5b9 ("USB: core: Fix
races in character device registration and deregistraion").

Guess I had to bitten by this to learn the syzbot interface. ;)
