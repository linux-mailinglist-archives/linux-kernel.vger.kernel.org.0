Does that means a changing for all those 'load.weight' related
calculation, to reserve the scaled weight?

I suppose u64 is capable for 'cfs_rq.load' to reserve the scaled up load,
changing all those places could be annoying but still fine.

However, I'm not quite sure about the benefit, how much more precision
we'll gain and does that really matters? better to have some testing to
demonstrate it.
