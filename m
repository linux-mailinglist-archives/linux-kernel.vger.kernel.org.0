FWIW, my knowledge of thermal is probably even less :)

For NanoPC-T4 I think I more or less just took Odroid-XU3/4 as the best 
pwm-fan example and adapted that into the existing RK3399 zones in the 
manner which seemed most logical to my interpretation - if what was 
there wasn't right to begin with, then I may well have done that wrong too.
