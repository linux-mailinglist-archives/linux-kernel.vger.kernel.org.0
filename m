And thikning more on that, I really _realy_ hate this.

You're basically saying WAKE is size-less, but that means we must
consider what it means to have a u32 WAIT on @ptr, and a u8 WAKE on
@ptr+1. If the wake really is size-less that should match.

I'd be much happier with requiring strict sizing. Because conversely,
what happens if you have a u32-WAIT at @ptr paired with a u8-WAKE at
@ptr? If we demand strict size we can say that should not match. This
does however mean we should include the size in the hash-match function.

Your Changelog did not consider these implications at all.
