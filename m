Hi Alex and Waiman,

Thanks a lot for your swift response and clarification.

You're right that the latest version of the patch handles long-term fairnes=
s
deterministically.

As I understand it, the n-th thread in the main queue is guaranteed to
acquire the lock after N lock handovers, where N is bounded by

n - 1 + 2^numa_spinlock_threshold * (nr_nodes - 1)

I'm not sure what role the variable nr_cpus_per_node plays in your analysis=
.

Do I miss anything?

Many thanks,
Lihao.
