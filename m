Yeah but a big task can end up being placed on a little CPU even if a
big CPU is idle. So, it's definitely sub-optimal.

I totally agree, the proper fix is to get select_idle_sibling() capacity
aware. And actually, it is true the DT should represent the HW, so
perhaps Amit's fix is the right thing to do so we don't let those hacky
topologies creep into mainline ... I just want to make sure we are fully
aware and OK with the fact that the performance on this platform might
be a little inconsistent until select_idle_sibling() is fixed.

Thanks,
Quentin
