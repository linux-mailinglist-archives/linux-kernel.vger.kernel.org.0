Looks like you mean Minchan's ack. Anyway, I don't object this one.

In fact, I've tested this patch and your fixes for migration problem
and found that there is
still migration problem and failure rate is increased by this patch.
However, given that
there is no progress on this area for a long time, I think that
applying the change aggressively
is required to break the current situation.

Thanks.
