That was to allow for identifying 'before' and 'after' text poke events.

Generally jump labels are used by default, whereas ftrace and probes are
more under the control of the user.  So just having jump labels done is the
main thing.

The tools have some support for copying out bpf-jit, although I am not sure
it guarantees to get short-lived code.
