Now we have got other two bug reports on different systems, finally
figured out it's the same issue as this after debugging. And adding
'nomodeset' can work around it.

With the help from our QA, tried to get more systems with mgag200,
seems not all of them have this issue, some of them with mgag200 can
jump to kdump well after panic.

Any suggestion about how to proceed? I can experiment. Or if you would
like to have a look when convenient, I can get one system to you to
check. Or, can we just use 'nomodeset' as work around and hold this
issue for the time being?

Appreciate if any suggestion or idea.
