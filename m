My suspicion is that this is really a bug in Panfrost than the scheduler.

I can see the following sequence:

1. Jobs submitted to *both* slot 0 and slot 1 on the hardware.

2. Hardware 'hangs' (most likely an unhandled page fault)

3. The reset timeouts occur. Because Panfrost uses a separate scheduler
for each slot this means we have two threads racing to kill the
respective jobs.

4. Each thread calls drm_sched_job_timedout which calls
panfrost_job_timedout().

5. Both threads calling panfrost_job_timedout() execute:

	for (i = 0; i < NUM_JOB_SLOTS; i++)
		drm_sched_stop(&pfdev->js->queue[i].sched, sched_job);

6. drm_sched_stop() will free the job from the other scheduler. So both
jobs get freed (and sched->free_guilty is set).

7. Depending on the exact race either drm_sched_increase_karma()
dereferences the freed job, or drm_sched_job_timedout() attempts to
double-free the job (because free_guilty is set).

Now there is a lock (pfdev->reset_lock) held during steps 5-6, but the
problem is that the job which has timed out can be freed by the other
scheduler's timeout before/after that critical section.

One obvious issue with the DRM scheduler is that there is a call to
cancel_delayed_work() in drm_sched_stop() which to me looks like it
should be cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure that the timeout handling
has completed.

However in the above scenario a _sync() variety would then cause a
deadlock (one thread has pfdev->reset_lock and is waiting for the other
thread which is trying to take the lock).

So we need to update Panfrost so that it can coordinate the reset
between schedulers. Can you try something like the following (untested):
