I noticed that version later :-(
The 'seqcount' is interesting, since it only protects against updates
that happen while the process itself is in kernel space.
It doesn't allow arbitrary kernel updates of the memory area.

Actually for what I'm doing i can truncate the counter to 32 bits
and not worry about when it wraps.

Anyway I've not got some histograms of the elapsed cycle counts
for recvfrom() and recvmsg() with, and without, some of the
HARDENED_USERCOPY costs.
