ACPI is not a bus.

Devicetree is not a bus.

A devicetree can contain multiple buses in the topology that is described.

You don't get to implement a general feature in a way that only supports
a subset of potential devicetree users.  Note the word "general".  This is
not a small isolated feature.

Now, am I being inconsistent if I say that it is ok for the feature to
only support devicetree systems, or only support ACPI systems?  I'll
have to ponder that.

But I don't think the question of only platform buses or all buses needs
to be resolved because I don't think that the add_links function is a bus
specific function.  The add_links function is specific to devicetree or
ACPI.

We seem to be talking past each other on this point right now.  I don't now
how to get our minds to the same place, but let's keep trying.

Yes, later is fine.  This is a detail.

You have already implemented the devicetree function, which is
of_link_to_suppliers().  The devicetree fwnode_operations would have
a pointer to of_link_to_suppliers().

If ACPI support is added, there would be an analogous ACPI aware function
that would essentially do the same thing that of_link_to_suppliers()
does.  This would be in the ACPI version of fwnode_operations.

There would not be a single function that is both devicetree aware and
ACPI aware.

We are still talking at cross purposes.  If my reply to (1) does not
change that, I'll have to go dig into how the fwnode framework figures
out which set of fwnode_operations to use for each device.

I suspected that might be the other source.  But we have been trying
to deprecate this type of data.

Yet another clue that the function pointer should not belong to the bus.
