Well, it's not straightforward.  No direct calls, it must be somehow
when kmod is used to load the module.  The only difference I see in
the udevadm output is the old system has attribute differences
capability new==11, old==1, event_poll_msec new=2000, old=-1.  I
figured if i could set the "hidden" attribute to 1 then it looks like
/proc/partitions won't list it (already "removable"attribute), but
udev doesn't seem to allow changing the attributes, only referencing
them. unless I'm missing something?
