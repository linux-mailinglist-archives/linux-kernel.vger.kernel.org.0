Hi Daniel.

Good work, nice cleanup all over.

A few comments to a few patches - not something that warrant a
new series to be posted as long as it is fixed before the patches are
applied.

I wonder - should this code consistently use __acquire() etc so we could
get a little static analysis help for the locking?

I have not played with this for several years and I do not know the
maturity of this today.

Or maybe after next kernel release.
Could we put this nice plan into todo.rst or similar so we do not have
to hunt it down by asking google?

For the whole series you can add my:

Some parts are reviewed as "this looks entirely correct", other parts
I would claim that I actually understood.
And after having spend some hours on this a r-b seems in order.
