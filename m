I started looking at this and actually had a slightly bigger cleanup in
mind. It seems odd that we have secure_computing() and
__secure_computing(). Especially in the mips and x86 case. From what I
can tell they could both rely on secure_computing() and don't need
__secure_computing().
If I can make those changes, we can make __secure_computing() static and
have only a single function secure_computing() that is used by all
arches which would make this code simpler.
Apparenly mips once switched from secure_computing() to
__secure_computing() because of bpf and tracepoints. The last change to
this was:

commit 3d729deaf287c43e415c5d791c9ac8414dbeff70
Author: James Hogan <jhogan@kernel.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 11 21:56:50 2017 +0100

    MIPS: seccomp: Fix indirect syscall args

which references a broken samples/bpf/tracex5 test. But in the thread to
this last change Kees and others were less than sure that this makes
sense. So I'm not sure. Maybe I should just try and send it out...
