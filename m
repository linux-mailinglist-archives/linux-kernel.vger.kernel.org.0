for his own personal use without knowing that his evil plans towards
diverting your
fund will be discovered.

Now that your ATM Visa Card is still available and ready for your
receiving, you can come down here to our Bank to pick up your Card
direct from my
office or alternatively it can be arranged ship to your address
through any registered reliable Courier Service Company that you will
take care of the Courier
Charge,hope it is cleared and accepted by you?

In this case, you are required to forward the following information:

1, Your full name and address:---
2, Your direct phone number for easy communication:---
3, Identification card or passport:-----
