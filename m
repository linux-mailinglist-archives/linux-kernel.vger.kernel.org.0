Hi Jiri,

I've being thinking how to use sort_entry but I have some troubles.

In v2, I used "struct perf_hpp_fmt" to pass extra argument. For example,

static int64_t block_cycles_cov_sort(struct perf_hpp_fmt *fmt,
				     struct hist_entry *left,
				     struct hist_entry *right)
{
	struct block_fmt *block_fmt = container_of(fmt, ...);
	struct report *rep = block_fmt->rep;
	...
}

But if I just use sort_entry, I can't pass extra argument (it's not a 
good idea to add more fields in struct hist_entry).

int64_t sort__xxx_sort(struct hist_entry *left,
		       struct hist_entry *right)

And for entry print it's similar, I can't pass extra argument in.

In v2,
static int block_cycles_pct_entry(struct perf_hpp_fmt *fmt,
				  struct perf_hpp *hpp,
				  struct hist_entry *he)
{
	struct block_fmt *block_fmt = container_of(fmt,...);
	struct report *rep = block_fmt->rep;
	...
}

But for se_snprintf, I can't pass extra argument in.

hist_entry__xxx_snprintf(struct hist_entry *he, char *bf,
			 size_t size, unsigned int width)

That's why I feel headache for just using the sort_entry. :(

Thanks
Jin Yao
