Hi Steven,
Your other email reminded me of this thread.  The easy "fix" we
decided to pursue was to simply turn on absolute timestamps for all
events and use up the extra space, which in our particular application
isn't a huge deal.  We haven't yet gotten around to trying to send a
patch for plumbing user-configurable absolute timestamps, but as noted
immediately above, the configuration for timestamp_mode is actually a
bit tricky to implement with the existing histogram ref counting.  The
way I was thinking about dealing with that was to have a separate bool
to indicate the state the user has indicated they want, and then you
have to work through all the possible combinations of behavior:

If user absolute timestamps is false, all behavior is exactly as today.
If user absolute timestamps is true, histogram refs transitioning 0->1
is a no-op, as is histogram refs transitioning 1->0.
If histogram refs are 0 and user absolute timestamps transition
false->true or true->false, they get what they want.
If histogram refs are >0 and user absolute timestamps transition
false->true, it's a no-op.

And the confusing one:
If histogram refs are >0 and user absolute timestamps transitions
true->false we can't turn off absolute timestamps and screw up the
histograms, so we return an error.  But user absolute timestamps is
now false, which means when histogram refs transitions back to 0, it
will turn off absolute timestamps.

What do you think of that?
