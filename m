There isn't a problem with *this* patch.  I could say, "sure, take it"
and the chances are everything could be fine from a technical
perspective.

However, I'm taking exception to the fact you think this series is
*special* enough to warrant circumventing the usual way in which we
usually work when dealing with cross-subsystem patch-sets.  Something
I personally deal with a lot due to the inherent hierarchical nature
of Multi-Functional Devices.

I'm on the fence on this one.  Due to the circumstances surrounding
*this* patch alone, it would be so much easier (for both of us!) to
just Ack the patch and hope no further changes occur which could
potentially cause someone else (you, me, Linus) more work later on.
However, I'm very keen to prevent setting a precedent for this kind of
action, as it's clearly not the right path to take in a vast majority
of cases.

> 1. As explained these chanegs need to stay together

The patch-set would stay together regardless.  That's the point of an
immutable branch, it can be taken in by all relevant parties and Git
will just do-the-right-thing.

This too is irrelevant, since the patch-set could/would go though
both/all trees simultaneously.  The way in which we normally work with
other subsystems doesn't involve a gamble over which subsystem is most
likely going to be affected by a merge conflict as you suggest, it
eradicates conflicts for all.

I'm not saying "no" by the way.  I just want to find out your
reasons/motivation as to why you're insisting this needs go through
a) a specific tree and b) just one tree.  Questions which I am yet to
see a compelling answer.
