Thanks for your comments.

Yes, I will add detailed performance test data in v2.

Sorry, I forgot to mention that the information about the zones that
are available to the node is still there.

The old for_each_zone_zonelist has been replaced with
for_each_zone_nodelist.

I will add some key implementation details in v2.

I'm not sure if I understand what you mean, but since commit
c9bff3eebc09 ("mm, page_alloc: rip out ZONELIST_ORDER_ZONE"), the
zonelist is always in "Node" order, so building the nodelist is fine.
