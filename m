Subject: [PATCH] SoC: rockchip: rockchip_max98090: Enable MICBIAS for headset keypress detection
Date:   Fri, 19 Jul 2019 19:39:29 +0200

The TS3A227E says that the headset keypress detection needs the MICBIAS
power in order to report the key events to ensure proper operation
The headset keypress detection needs the MICBIAS power in order to report
the key events all the time as long as MIC is present. So MICBIAS pin
is forced on when a MICROPHONE is detected.

On Veyron Minnie I observed that if the MICBIAS power is not present and
the key press detection is activated (just because it is enabled when you
insert a headset), it randomly reports a keypress on insert.
E.g. (KEY_PLAYPAUSE)

 Event: (SW_HEADPHONE_INSERT), value 1
 Event: (SW_MICROPHONE_INSERT), value 1
 Event: -------------- SYN_REPORT ------------
 Event: (KEY_PLAYPAUSE), value 1

Userspace thinks that KEY_PLAYPAUSE is pressed and produces the annoying
effect that the media player starts a play/pause loop.

Note that, although most of the time the key reported is the one
associated with BTN_0, not always this is true. On my tests I also saw
different keys reported

Some notes about the patch

Steps to test (userspace GNOME3):
1. Play audio using a media player
2. Make sure the Internal MIC is selected as audio input device and
doesn't switches when you insert the headset.
3. Insert a headset (with buttons)

Audio switches to headphones and you can hear that enters on a loop
play/pause if the KEY_PLAYPAUSE was reported. Also you can check that
press to any headset button doesn't work.

The part where the datasheet says that power must be supplied in order
to have keypress detection work is in page 44 of [1]

"
The TS3A227E can monitor the microphone line of a 4-pole headset to
detect up to 4 key presses/releases and report the key press events
back to the host. The key press detection must be activated manually
by setting the KP Enable bit of the Device Settings 2 register. To
ensure proper operation the MICBIAS voltage must be applied to MICP
before enabling key press detection.
