My testing appeared not sufficiently exhaustive. The fix indeed resolved my 
initially discovered issue of not being able to rebind the i915 driver to a 
re-plugged device, however it brought another, probably more serious problem 
to light.

When an open i915 device is hot unplugged, IOMMU bus notifier now cleans up 
IOMMU info for the device on PCI device remove while the i915 driver is still 
not released, kept by open file descriptors.  Then, on last device close, 
cleanup attempts lead to kernel panic raised from intel_unmap() on unresolved 
IOMMU domain.

With commit 458b7c8e0dde reverted and my fix applied, both late device close 
and device re-plug work for me.  However, I can realize that's probably still 
not a complete solution, possibly missing some protection against reuse of a 
removed device other than for cleanup.  If you think that's the right way to 
go, I can work more on that.

I've had a look at other drivers and found AMD is using somehow similar 
approach.  On the other hand, looking at the IOMMU common code I couldn't 
identify any arrangement that would support deferred device cleanup.

If that approach is not acceptable for Intel IOMMU, please suggest a way you'd 
like to have it resolved and I can try to implement it.

Thanks,
Janusz
