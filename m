The reason for the if was to kick the device into 32 bit descriptors,
which are usually more efficient, especially with older dual descriptor
format cards like we have on parisc systems.

Nothing should go wrong if we don't fail the larger mask request except
that the card uses the inefficient descriptors whereas we'll only
supply it with 32 bit addresses.
