Right.

*sigh*, I didn't know there was such a resistance to change the tooling.
That seems very unfortunate :-/

It's trying to avoid the RmW pulling the line in exclusive/modified
state in a loop. The basic C-CAS pattern if you will.

It's probably not terrible to put a READ_ONCE() there; we just need to
make sure the compiler doesn't do something stupid (it is known to do
stupid when 'volatile' is present).

But the fact remains that it is entirely superfluous, there is no
possible way the compiler can wreck this.
