Yes, but do note that my arm64 implementation catches
increment-from-zero as well.

Moving the post checks before the stores you mean? That shouldn't be
too difficult, I suppose, but it will certainly cost performance.

I think the question whether the benchmark is valid is justified, but
otoh, we are obsessed with hackbench which is not that representative
of a real workload either. It would be better to discuss these changes
in the context of known real-world use cases where refcounts are a
true bottleneck.

Also, I'd like to have Kees's view on the gap between REFCOUNT_FULL
and the fast version on arm64. I'm not convinced the cases we are not
covering are such a big deal.
