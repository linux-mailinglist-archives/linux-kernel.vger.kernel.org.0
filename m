The memblock refactoring went in in 5.1 which was May 5, and likely it
caused the regression.

Unless I'm missing something, before the memblock refactoring the CMA
reservation could use the entire physical memory because
memblock_phys_alloc() didn't enforce memblock.current_limit.

Since memblock default is to allocate from top, cma_declare_contiguous()
could grab the memory close to the end of DRAM and thus have physical
address close enough to the virtual address to fit in the 2G limit.

When I've made memblock_phys* limit the memblock allocations to
memblock.current_limit the CMA area moved too far away down and the gap
became larger than 2G.

It does not seem like dealing with this in etnaviv driver and DMA and CMA
APIs would happen fast and the "revert" of the memblock changes I've sent
earlier in this thread does fix the problem.

Andrew, would you like me to resend the patch in a separate e-mail?
