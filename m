SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_SPEC_ALLOW doesn't completely solve the problem because
it enables everything, including cross process defenses, like Spectre.

The motivation of my patch was to only allow to disable SSBD, which
is only relevant for in process attacks, which are completely
mitigated by process isolation, which is now widely deployed.

Completely mitigating Spectre (which could be cross process) is harder,
and it doesn't have have as bad a performance impact as SSBD.

It seems to me this design goal is not useful for 
speculation defenses. If an attacker can call prctl they don't
need speculation attacks anymore, they can just read the memory
directly.

The seccomp defenses are mainly for web browsers, whose life cycles have
nothing to do with LTS cycles. Web browsers are updated much faster
because of their bazillion other security holes. If someone doesn't
update their web browser they are completely open to other attacks anyways.
So we can assume they do, and the browsers usually enforce it in 
some way.

I'm not aware of anything else that is not a browser that would rely on the
seccomp heuristic. Are you?

Anyways back to the opt-in:

Anyways one way to keep your design goals would be to split the SECCOMP
flags into flags for SSBD and SPECTRE. Then at least the web browser
could reenable it
