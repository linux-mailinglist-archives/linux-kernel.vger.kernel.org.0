Yes, when I get this to a submission point, I plan on having *a lot*
more comments all over the place.

IIRC, we started doing this because it allows the dependencies to be
defined in the kernel/trace directory. That is, if
CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FATRCE_WITH_DIRECT_CALLS is set, then we know that
direct calls *and* DYNAMIC_FTRACE is enabled. It cuts down on some of
the more complex #if or the arch needing to do

 select HAVE_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_DIRECT_CALLS if DYNAMIC_FTRACE

It may be overkill, but it does keep the pain in one place.

The alloc and copy is made to always create a new hash (because of the
way we do enabling of new filters in the set_ftrace_filter).

I pulled this part out so that the direct_functions hash only needs to
grow and allocate, when needed. Not to reallocate at every update.

Correct. I talked with Josh on IRC and we are looking into removing the
pushf/popf from the ftrace_regs_caller to see if that helps in the
performance for live patching. I'm also currently working on making
this patch not on top of the IP modify one, so the IP modify doesn't
need to be applied.

This also cleans up the asm code a bit more (getting rid of the macro).

Yes, there's actually a few places that I noticed needed some more care
with locking. And I also found some that are missing now (without these
changes).

I did say this patch is buggy ;-)

See http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20191016113316.13415-1-mbenes@suse.cz

I can (and should) add the PERMANENT flag to the direct_ops.

Note, the PERMANENT patches will be added before this one.

The ftrace_disable and ftrace_kill is when a bug happens that is so bad
that the ftrace can probably kill the system. It's time for a reboot.

It basically freezes it. Current registered ftrace_ops will not be
touched. But nothing can be removed or added.

It's basically saying, "Something totally wrong has happened, and if I
touch the code here, I may panic the box. So don't do anything more!"

And yes, without adding some of theses, I have in fact paniced the box.

This is something that Ingo drilled hard into me, as modifying text is
such a dangerous operation, that there should be constant checks that
things are happening the way they expect them to be, and if anomaly
happens, stop touching everything.

OK, I'll work to get this patch in for the next merge window.

Thanks for the review.
