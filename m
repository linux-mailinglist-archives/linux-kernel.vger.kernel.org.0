Right, in short the fundamental problem is that of_iommu_configure() now 
does the wrong thing. Deferring probe of the entire host bridge/root 
complex based on "iommu-map" would indeed happen to solve the problem by 
brute force, I think, but could lead to a dependency cycle for PCI-based 
IOMMUs as Jean points out. I hope to have time this week to work a bit 
more on pulling of_iommu_configure() apart to fix it properly, after 
which of_devlink *should* only have to worry about the child devices 
themselves...
