We have been using the /proc/pagetypeinfo for debugging, mainly for
client platforms like phones/tablets. We met problems like very slow
system response or OOM things, and many of them could be related with
memory pressure or fragmentation issues, where monitoring /proc/pagetypeinfo
will be very useful for debugging.

So I think Michal's idea to change it to 0400 is a good idea.
