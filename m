Rename the mtd documentation files to ReST, add an
index for them and adjust in order to produce a nice html
output via the Sphinx build system.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

 LIBNDCTL: namespace enumeration example
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Namespaces are indexed relative to their parent region, example below.
 These indexes are mostly static from boot to boot, but subsystem makes
 no guarantees in this regard.  For a static namespace identifier use its
 'uuid' attribute.

 LIBNDCTL: namespace creation example
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
 Idle namespaces are automatically created by the kernel if a given
 region has enough available capacity to create a new namespace.
 Namespace instantiation involves finding an idle namespace and
 configuring it.  For the most part the setting of namespace attributes
 can occur in any order, the only constraint is that 'uuid' must be set
 before 'size'.  This enables the kernel to track DPA allocations

 Why the Term "namespace"?
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
     1. Why not "volume" for instance?  "volume" ran the risk of confusing
-    ND (libnvdimm subsystem) to a volume manager like device-mapper.

     2. The term originated to describe the sub-devices that can be created

-    http://www.nvmexpress.org/specifications/), and NFIT namespaces are

 LIBNVDIMM/LIBNDCTL: Block Translation Table "btt"
----------------------------------------------
+-------------------------------------------------
 
 A BTT (design document: http://pmem.io/2014/09/23/btt.html) is a stacked
 block device driver that fronts either the whole block device or a
 partition of a block device emitted by either a PMEM or BLK NAMESPACE.
 
 LIBNVDIMM: btt layout
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
 Every region will start out with at least one BTT device which is the
 seed device.  To activate it set the "namespace", "uuid", and
 "sector_size" attributes and then bind the device to the nd_pmem or
-nd_blk driver depending on the region type.
