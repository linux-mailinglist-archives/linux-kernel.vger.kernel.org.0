It might be problematic, since vsnprintf() can be called recursively.

So, then don't use snprintf() for this, simple memcpy() designed for that kind
of things.

Fine.

In terms of vsnprintf(), and actually compiler point of view, it's not a string
anymore, it's a text-based data.

Personally, I don't see an advantage of a deep intrusion into vsnprintf().
The wrapper can be made to achieve this w/o touching the generic code. Thus,
you can quickly and cleanly fix the issue, while discussing this with wider
audience.
