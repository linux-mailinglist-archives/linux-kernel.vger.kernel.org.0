Using data_race() here seems misleading - there is no race, but we're
using data_race() to suppress a false positive warning from KCSAN, yes?

That's a bit hacky.  If this happens rarely then perhaps adding a
suitable comment in page_zonenum() which explains this will suffice. 
But if we keep on abusing data_race() in this fashion then it would be
better to add a new macro for this purpose.
