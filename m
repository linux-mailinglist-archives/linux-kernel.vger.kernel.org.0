Too specific use case IMO and I am not sure if we need a generic solution
to deal with this. Anyways, I don't see any check in arch/psci specific
code for what you want, just ensure reboot_mode is set appropriately.
Post a patch and see what people have to say.

May be or may be not, post the patch and let's see.
