I guess this describes it incorrectly.
The problem is integer promotion of negation operation for any bit basically.

For example, if we have bit 3 (nr = 3) and got it in the clear bit we will
get (according to what I see in the warnings) 0xfffffff7. Which is simple
~(1 << 3) promoted to integer.

I think it is a C standard which dictates this, compiler just follows.
