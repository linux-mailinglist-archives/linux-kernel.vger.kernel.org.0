Subject: [PATCH v5 0/5] ARM: dts: imx: Add GW59xx Gateworks specials
Date:   Mon, 30 Dec 2019 15:19:48 -0800

This series adds board support for the GW59xx Gateworks Ventana family
specials.

Changes in v2:
 - Generalized node names
 - Removed unnecessary labels
 - Expanded patch subject
 - Removed undocumented compatible string in dts**

** I realize that the "gw,ventana" still exists here, but that cant be removed
without breaking a conditional check in arch/arm/mach-imx/mach-imx6q.c

Changes in v3:
 - Fixed a conflict in arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile

Changes in v4:
 - Clarified authorship
 - Added dt-bindings compatible entries

Changes in v5:
 - Added documentation schema permutations for all gateworks ventana boards
 - Added back compatible strings from dts removed in v2
