Like I said, I'm ambivalent and not NAK'ing it. It looks ok, but at
the same time something is wrong if a hot path is constantly
re-looking up a resource. The fact that it shows up in profiles when
that happens could be considered useful.

It turns out that the ability to ask the driver for pgprot bits is
useful above and beyond this performance optimization. For example I'm
looking to use it to support disabling speculation into pages with
known  media errors by letting the driver consult its 'badblock' list.
There are also usages for passing the key-id for persistent memory
encrypted by MKTME.
