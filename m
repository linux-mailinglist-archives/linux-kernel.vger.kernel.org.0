I recall that this was the preferred way of doing this from the RPM
folks. Tegra30 I2S driver does the same and Stephen had pointed me to
this as a reference. I believe that this is meant to ensure that the
device is always powered-off regardless of it RPM is enabled or not and
what the current state is.

Now for Tegra210 (or actually 64-bit Tegra) RPM is always enabled and so
we don't need to worry about the !RPM case. However, I still don't see
the harm in this.
