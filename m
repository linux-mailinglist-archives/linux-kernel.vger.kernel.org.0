This is just a temporary hiding of the issue, not a complete fix.
Vincenzo will do the fix later on.

I agree, it just needs some tweaking and hopefully we get most of it
fixed in 5.4.

We need the third compiler here for the compat vDSO (at least with gcc),
COMPATCC. I'm tempted to just drop the CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO
altogether and only rely on a COMPATCC. This way we can add
COMPATCC_IS_CLANG etc. in the Kconfig checks directly.

If clang can build both 32 and 64-bit with the same binary (just
different options), we could maybe have COMPATCC default to CC and add a
check on whether COMPATCC generates 32-bit binaries.

Whether clang or gcc, I'd like this fixed anyway. At some point we may
inadvertently rely on some code which is patched at boot time for the
kernel code but not for the vDSO.

Thanks.
