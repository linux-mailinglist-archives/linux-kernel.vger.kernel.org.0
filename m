Is this if we disable FW_FEATURE_MULTITCE in the guest and force the use
of H_PUT_TCE everywhere?

In theory couldn't we leave FW_FEATURE_MULTITCE in place so that
iommu_table_clear() can still use H_STUFF_TCE (which I guess is basically
instant), and then force H_PUT_TCE for new mappings via something like:

diff --git a/arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/iommu.c b/arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/iommu.c
index 6ba081dd61c9..85d092baf17d 100644
--- a/arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/iommu.c
+++ b/arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/iommu.c
@@ -194,6 +194,7 @@ static int tce_buildmulti_pSeriesLP(struct iommu_table *tbl, long tcenum,
        unsigned long flags;
 
        if ((npages == 1) || !firmware_has_feature(FW_FEATURE_MULTITCE)) {
+       if ((npages == 1) || !firmware_has_feature(FW_FEATURE_MULTITCE) || is_secure_guest()) {
                return tce_build_pSeriesLP(tbl, tcenum, npages, uaddr,
                                           direction, attrs);
        }

That seems like it would avoid the extra 13s.

If we take the additional step of only mapping SWIOTLB range in
enable_ddw() for is_secure_guest() that might further improve things
(though the bigger motivation with that is the extra isolation it would
grant us for stuff behind the IOMMU, since it apparently doesn't affect
boot-time all that much)
