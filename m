Ok, sorry. Here the same text without code snippets and links:

In `__regmap_init()` `_regmap_bus_reg_read()`is assigned to
`regmap.reg_read()` if there are no `bus->read/write` functions, else
`_regmap_bus_read()` is assigned.

`_regmap_bus_reg_read()` calls the `reg_read` function of the bus
directly, `_regmap_bus_read()` instead calls `_regmap_raw_read()`.

`_regmap_raw_read()` in turn calls `_regmap_range_lookup()` and
`_regmap_select_page()` which do the paging.

`regmap_mmio` does not contain `bus->read/write`, but does contain
`bus->reg_read/reg_write` only.

>> `regmap_i2c` does -contain both-.

Sorry, I have to correct myself here. It does only contain the
`bus->read/write` functions.

If I understand correctly it is relying on having plain
`bus->read/write` operations. MMIO *has* `bus->reg_read/reg_write` but
is missing the former. But maybe I just mix up the wording here.

Yes, this works. But it comes at the cost of implementing (and
maintaining) something which already exists. And the existing
implementation which uses virtual memory addresses is much smarter than
my current implementation.

Sorry, but I do not get why this shouldn't work with MMIO? If I
understood the code correctly in  `_regmap_raw_read` the address is
checked before it is used anywhere. If
`_regmap_range_lookup()` returns a range it does the paging, i.e.
translates the virtual address into the real address
(`_regmap_select_page`). If so the real address is passed to
`bus->read/write`, else the given address is used directly. Do I miss
something here?

Maybe for some reason the current MMIO implementation should not be
touched, or paging for MMIO is not wanted?

Maybe it is sufficient to implement `bus->read/write` as a wrapper of
`bus->reg_read/reg_write` in regmap-mmio.c?
