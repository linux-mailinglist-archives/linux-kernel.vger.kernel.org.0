That's simple. Today any ARM{32,64} DT based platform sets their cluster
id to physical package id, which is exposed to userspace. The userspace
can/must interpret that as multi-socket system. E.g. TC2/Juno which
2 clusters show up as 2 socket systems which is wrong and needs fixing.
We have fixed it for ARM64 ACPI based systems but for DT(mostly used in
mobile/embedded) we need to make sure we don't break anything else before
we fix it.
