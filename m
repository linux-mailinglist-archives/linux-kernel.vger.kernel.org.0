I don't think that is another topic at all. It is a quality of
implementation issue. We already have too many copies of all that (3).

So basically you want to fudge the wake function to do the/a @cond test,
not unlike what wait_bit already does, but differenly.

I'm really rather annoyed with C for not having proper lambda functions;
that would make all this so much easier. Anyway, let me have a poke at
this in the morning, it's late already.

Also, is anything actually using wait_queue_entry::private ? I'm
not finding any in a hurry.
