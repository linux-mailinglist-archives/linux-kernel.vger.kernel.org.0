Subject: [Patch v2] mm/rmap.c: split huge pmd when it really is
Date:   Tue, 24 Dec 2019 06:28:56 +0800
Message-Id: <20191223222856.7189-1-richardw.yang@linux.intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1

When page is not NULL, function is called by try_to_unmap_one() with
TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD set. There are two cases to call try_to_unmap_one()
with TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD set:

  * unmap_page()
  * shrink_page_list()

In both case, the page passed to try_to_unmap_one() is PageHead() of the
THP. If this page's mapping address in process is not HPAGE_PMD_SIZE
aligned, this means the THP is not mapped as PMD THP in this process.
This could happen when we do mremap() a PMD size range to an un-aligned
address.

Currently, this case is handled by following check in __split_huge_pmd()
luckily.

  page != pmd_page(*pmd)

This patch checks the address to skip some work.

v2: move the check into split_huge_pmd_address().
