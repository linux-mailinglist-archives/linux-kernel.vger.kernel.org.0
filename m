I think I understand the problem you are pointing
out, but if update_load_avg() keeps the load average
for the runqueue unchanged (because that is rate limited
to once a jiffy, and has been like that for a while),
why would calc_group_shares() result in a different value
than what it returned the last time?

What am I overlooking?
