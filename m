In all honesty, this would be a terrible API and I think we need to come
up with something better than this. I don't want to pass down an array
of structs and in general would like to avoid this array + size pattern.
That pattern kinda made sense for the pid array because of pid
namespaces being nested but not for this case, I think. Also, why
require the additional clockid argument here? That makes sense for
clock_settime() and clock_gettime() but here we could just do:

struct timens {
	struct timespec clock_bootime;
	struct timespec clock_monotonic;
};

no? And since you need to expose that struct in a header somewhere
anyway you can version it by size just like clone_args. So the kernel
can apply the same pattern to be backwards compatible that we have with
struct clone_args and for openat2()'s struct open_how via
copy_struct_from_user. Then you only need one additional pointer in
struct clone_args.

What do we think?
