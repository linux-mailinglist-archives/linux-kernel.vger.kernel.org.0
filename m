This is not what I meant. After an OOM event happens, many kernel memory
allocations could fail. Since very few people are testing those error-paths due
to allocation failures, it is considered one of those most buggy areas in the
kernel. Developers have mostly been focus on making sure the kernel OOM should
not happen in the first place.

I still think the time is better spending on improving things like eBPF, oomd
and kdump etc to solve your problem, but leave the kernel OOM report code alone.
