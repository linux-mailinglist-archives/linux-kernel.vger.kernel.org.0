I forwarded it to you.

Here are the patches in git:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/luto/linux.git/log/?h=task_size

it's "unaligned", "fix test sparse warning", optionally
"strncpy_from_user: Zero any extra output bytes that get written",
"uaccess: Add a selftest for strncpy_from_user()", and
"strncpy_from_user: Don't overrun the input buffer onto the next page"

The basic summary is that Linus didn't like calling it bug fix, but it
might be acceptable as an improvement.  I also thought that the
KERNEL_DS oops was changed so it didn't trigger here.
