Correct.

It was removed in v20[*].

Heh, depends on your development environment, e.g. I do 99% of my testing
in a VM with a very minimal kernel that even an anemic system can
incrementally build in a handful of seconds.

As of today, the only part of the driver that can be extracted into a
module is effectively the ioctl() handlers, i.e. a module would just be an
ioctl() wrapper around a bunch of in-kernel functionality.  At that point,
building the "driver" as a module doesn't provide any novel benefit, e.g.
very little memory footprint savings, reloading the module wouldn't "fix"
any bugs with EPC management, SGX can still be forcefully disabled via
kernel parameter, etc...  And on the flip side, allowing it to be a module
would require exporting a non-trivial number of APIs that really shouldn't
be exposed outside of the SGX subsystem.

As for why things are baked into the kernel:

  - EPC management: support for future enhancements (KVM and EPC cgroup).

  - Reclaim: don't add a unnecessary infrastructure, i.e. avoid a callback
    mechanism for which there is a single implementation.

  - Tracking of LEPUBKEYHASH MSRs: KVM support.
