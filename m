If you have usbhid loaded as a module instead of built into the kernel, 
then it probably is getting loaded from the initramfs.  If you didn't 
rebuild the initramfs image after creating the new kernel, you would 
end up loading the original module without the new quirk entry.

It's easy enough to test this.  After booting, do:

	rmmod usbhid ; modprobe usbhid

and see if the quirk entry then shows up in sysfs.
