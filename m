Really? We all here used to think that kernel programming is one of
the most difficult professions in the world. There is huge cost of
proper implementation of a feature, careful review, spread testing on
various platforms and long-term maintenance and support.

In this specific example of exposing TASK_SIZE your team made too much
things wrong to realize it, I hope.

I found this thread thrilling. Please keep me in CC with your
/proc/<pid>/status effort.
