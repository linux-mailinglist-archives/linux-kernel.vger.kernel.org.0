I have no issues with adding the root bus device, so we really need the
sdw_master_device. That really was a miss from me. If Pierre remove the
driver parts from this set, I would merge the rest in a heartbeat.

But in the mix we dont want to add a new driver which is dummy. The
PCI/DT device will have a driver which is something to be used here.

For Qualcomm controller, we get a DT device and driver and that does the
job, it doesn't need one more driver and probe routine.

If Pierre had a PCI device for SDW controller, he would not be asking
for this, since Intel has a complex device, and he would like to split
the functions, the need of a new driver arises. But the whole subsystem
should not be burdened for that. It can be managed without that and is
really an Intel issue not a subsystem one.
