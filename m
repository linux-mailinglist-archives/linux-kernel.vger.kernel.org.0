In fact, this is a very good point, since between the moment the worker
determines that the queue is empty and the moment in which the worker
effectively exits (and it's marked as no more pending by the Kernel cmwq)
there is a window of opportunity for a race in which the ISR could fill
the queue with one more event and then fail to kick with queue_work() since
the work is in fact still nominally marked as pending from the point of view
of Kernel cmwq, as below:

ISR (core N)		|	WQ (core N+1)		cmwq flags	       	queued events
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			| if (queue_is_empty)		- WORK_PENDING		0 events queued
			+     ...			- WORK_PENDING		0 events queued
			+ } while (scmi_process_event_payload);
			+}// worker function exit 
kfifo_in()		+     ...cmwq backing out	- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
kfifo_in()		+     ...cmwq backing out	- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
queue_work()		+     ...cmwq backing out	- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
  -> FALSE (pending)	+     ...cmwq backing out	- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
			+     ...cmwq backing out	- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
			+     ...cmwq backing out	- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
			| ---- WORKER THREAD EXIT	- !WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
			| 		 		- !WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
kfifo_in()		|     				- !WORK_PENDING		2 events queued
kfifo_in()		|  				- !WORK_PENDING		2 events queued
queue_work()		|     				- !WORK_PENDING		2 events queued
   -> TRUE		| --- WORKER ENTER		- WORK_PENDING		2 events queued
			|  				- WORK_PENDING		2 events consumed
		
where effectively the last event queued won't be consumed till the next
iteration once another event is queued.

Given the fact that the ISR and the dedicated WQ on an SMP run effectively
in parallel I do not think unfortunately that we can simply count on the fact
the worker exit is faster than the kifos_in, enough to close the race window
opportunity. (even if rare)

On the other side considering the impact of such scenario, I can imagine that
it's not simply that we could only have a delayed delivery, but we must consider
that if the delayed event is effectively the last one ever it would remain
undelivered forever; this is particularly worrying in a scenario in which such
last event is particularly important: imagine a system shutdown where a last
system-power-off remains undelivered.

As a consequence I think this rare racy condition should be addressed somehow.

Looking at this scenario, it seems the classic situation in which you want to
use some sort of completion to avoid missing out on events delivery, BUT in our
usecase:

- placing the workers loaned from cmwq into an unbounded wait_for_completion()
  once the queue is empty seems not the best to use resources (and probably
  frowned upon)....using a few dedicated kernel threads to simply let them idle
  waiting most of the time seems equally frowned upon (I could be wrong...))
- the needed complete() in the ISR would introduce a spinlock_irqsave into the
  interrupt path (there's already one inside queue_work in fact) so it is not
  desirable, at least not if used on a regular base (for each event notified)

So I was thinking to try to reduce sensibly the above race window, more
than eliminate it completely, by adding an early flag to be checked under
specific conditions in order to retry the queue_work a few times when the race
is hit, something like:

ISR (core N)		|	WQ (core N+1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			| atomic_set(&exiting, 0);
			|
			| do {
			|	...
			| 	if (queue_is_empty)		- WORK_PENDING		0 events queued
			+          atomic_set(&exiting, 1)	- WORK_PENDING		0 events queued
static int cnt=3	|          --> breakout of while	- WORK_PENDING		0 events queued
kfifo_in()		|	....
			| } while (scmi_process_event_payload);
kfifo_in()		|
exiting = atomic_read()	|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
do {			|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
    ret = queue_work() 	|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
    if (ret || !exiting)|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
	break;		|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
    mdelay(5);		|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
    exiting =		|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
      atomic_read;	|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
} while (--cnt);	|     ...cmwq backing out		- WORK_PENDING		1 events queued
			| ---- WORKER EXIT 			- !WORK_PENDING		0 events queued

like down below between the scissors.

Not tested or tried....I could be missing something...and the mdelay is horrible (and not
the cleanest thing you've ever seen probably :D)...I'll have a chat with Sudeep too.
