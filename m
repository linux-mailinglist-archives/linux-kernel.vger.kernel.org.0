I'd been using a quick-and-dirty script that does something similar, and ran
it along with rcutorture, a kernel build, and something that randomly
changes affinities -- though with these loads I have to ignore occasional
RCU forward progress complaints that Paul said were expected with this
version of the RCU code, XFS warnings that happen even on unmodified non-RT, 
and sometimes a transitory netdev timeout that is not that surprising given
the heavy load and affinity stress (I get it without these patches as well,
though it takes longer).

I just ran Steven's script (both alone and with the other stuff above) and
saw no difference.
