As previously discussed, we should only hot-remove memory which was
hot-added, so we shouldn't encounter memory allocated from memblock.

I think that you can simplify the paragraphs above down to:

  The arch code for hot-remove must tear down portions of the linear map
  and vmemmap corresponding to memory being removed. In both cases the
  page tables mapping these regions must be freed, and when sparse
  vmemmap is in use the memory backing the vmemmap must also be freed.

  This patch adds a new remove_pagetable() helper which can be used to
  tear down either region, and calls it from vmemmap_free() and
  ___remove_pgd_mapping(). The sparse_vmap argument determines whether
  the backing memory will be freed.

Could you add a paragraph describing when we can encounter partial
tables (for which we need the p??_none() checks? IIUC that's not just
for cleaning up a failed hot-add, and it would be good to call that out.

Nit: s/arch_add_mempory/arch_add_memory/.

Can we fold the check in and remove the ifdeferry? e.g.

static void free_pmd_table(pmd_t *pmdp, pud_t *pudp, unsigned long addr)
{
	struct page *page;
	int i;

	if (CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS <= 2)
		return;
	
	...
}

... that would ensure that we always got build coverage here, and
minimize duplication. We do similar in map_kernel() and
early_fixmap_init() today.

Likewise for the other levels.

For arm64, the general policy is to use READ_ONCE() when reading a page
table entry (even if not strictly necessary), so please do so
consistently.

Please use a temporary pte variable here, e.g.

static void remove_pte_table(pmd_t *pmdp, unsigned long addr,
			     unsigned long end, bool sparse_vmap)
{
	unsigned long start = addr;
	struct page *page;
	pte_t *ptep, pte;

	for (; addr < end; addr += PAGE_SIZE) {
		ptep = pte_offset_kernel(pmdp, addr);
		pte = READ_ONCE(*ptep);

		if (!pte_present(pte))
			continue;
		
		if (sparse_vmap) {
			page = pte_page(pte);
			free_hotplug_page_range(page, PAGE_SIZE);
		}

		pte_clear(&init_mm, addr, ptep);
	}

	flush_tlb_kernel_range(start, end);
}

Likewise for the other levels.

It would be good to explain why we need to take the ptl here.

IIUC that shouldn't be necessary for the linear map. Am I mistaken?

Is there a specific race when tearing down the vmemmap?

Thanks,
Mark.
