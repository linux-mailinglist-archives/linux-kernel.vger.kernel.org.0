A latency nice that does not allow reducing the latency of select tasks at the expense of the throughput of other tasks 
(ie the classic trade-off) doesn't seem to be all that useful and would fail to meet the requirements. Latency nice in 
this view is a directive on how to make that trade-off much like nice is a directive on how to trade-off what should get 
to run next and we don't accept the system optionally treating +19 and -20 tasks the same. Even when we don't get 
exactly what we want we expect "best effort" and that is not the same as optional.
