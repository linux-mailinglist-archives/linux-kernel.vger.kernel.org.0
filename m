Consider this example:
int main()
{
	char str[] = "Xabcde";
	char *s = str+1;
	char *d = str; // overlap

	memmove(d, s, 5);
	printf("%s\n", s);
	printf("%s\n", d);
}

yury:linux$ ./a.out
bcdee
abcdee

After memmove(), s[0] == 'b', which is wrong.

In current version src is used after memmove() to set 'keep', which
may cause similar problem

No. Do you have in mind a dst != src usecase?

There is no consistent interface. Bitmap_{set,clear) uses one
notaton, bitmap_{and,or,shift) - another. I think that 'unary'
operations should not copy the whole bitmap. If user wants, he
can easily do it. In practice, nobody wants.

I think it should work. Can you elaborate?
