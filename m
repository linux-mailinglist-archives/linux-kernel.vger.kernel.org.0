I tested 64 bytes rng-seed previously so didn't hit the threshold that
makes it suspend. Thanks for pointing this out.
+1 for changing the add_bootloader_randomness() function as you
suggested to avoid this issue. But besides credit_entropy_bits(), they
are also different on crng_init (crng_fast_load/crng_slow_load).
