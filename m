The commit bd4c82c22c36 ("mm, THP, swap: delay splitting THP after 
swapped out") was added in 4.14, it might be not used widely yet. And we 
need swap + THPs to trigger it, furthermore the misbehavior might be 
accumulative over time. I don't expect it will have any obvious 
misbehavior for a single shot.

Actually, such unsync has been there for a while. The 
isolate_lru_pages() returns nr_taken which has THP accounted as 512 base 
pages, but nr_scanned just shows 1. nr_taken is not showed via 
/proc/vmstat, but it is showed via trace point.

I think we can just account 512 base pages for nr_scanned for 
isolate_lru_pages() to make the counters sane since PGSCAN_KSWAPD/DIRECT 
just use it.

And, sc->nr_scanned should be accounted as 512 base pages too otherwise 
we may have nr_scanned < nr_to_reclaim all the time to result in 
false-negative for priority raise and something else wrong (e.g. wrong 
vmpressure).
