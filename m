And because reads are not protected by any lock or memory barrier,
using READ_ONCE() is pointless. The CPU could be doing a lot of hidden
manipulation of that variable too.

Again, this is just to enable caching of the comm. Nothing more. It's a
"best effort" algorithm. We get it, we then can map a pid to a name. If
not, we just have a pid and we map "<...>".

Next you'll be asking for the memory barriers to guarantee a real hit.
And honestly, this information is not worth any overhead.

And most often we enable this before we enable the tracepoint we want
this information from, which requires modification of the text area and
will do a bunch of syncs across CPUs. That alone will most likely keep
any race from happening.

The only real bug is the check to know if we should add the probe or
not was done outside the lock, and when we hit the race, we could add a
probe twice, causing the kernel to spit out a warning. You fixed that,
and that's all that needs to be done. I'm now even more against adding
the READ_ONCE() or WRITE_ONCE().
