vscnprintf() with NULL pointer is perfectly fine. Only the formatted
string has variable size.

Log level, timestamp, and other information can be stored as
metadata with a fixed size, see struct printk_log. They are
formatted as text later, see msg_print_text() and
msg_print_ext_header().

Yes, I think that we need to store the strings in variable
sized chunks.
