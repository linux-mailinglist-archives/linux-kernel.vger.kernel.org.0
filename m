Funny enough, this e-mail arrived here after Greg's reply, and my
reply over his one :-)

-

With regards to the script, my idea is to have it run on a new
"validate" mode, when the Kernel is built with COMPILE_TEST:

	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/log/?h=abi_patches_v4

NB: the last patch is not yet... somehow, the building system is not
passing CONFIG_WARN_ABI_ERRORS to Documentation/Makefile. I'm
debugging it.

Personally, I would prefer to keep it the way it is, with two
additions:

1) I would add a SPDX header at the fist line of each file there;

2) It would make sense to have a new field - or indicator - to let
add ReST markups at the description. 

The advantage of using a parseable ABI file is that it is possible
to parse it, for example, to search for a symbol:

	$ ./scripts/get_abi.pl voltage_max

	/sys/class/power_supply/<supply_name>/voltage_max
	-------------------------------------------------

	Date:			January 2008
	Contact:		linux-pm@vger.kernel.org
	Defined on file:	Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-power

	Description:

	Reports the maximum VBUS voltage the supply can support.

	Access: Read
	Valid values: Represented in microvolts

	...

No idea about how much time it would take if written in python,
but this perl script is really fast:

	$ time ./scripts/get_abi.pl search voltage_max >/dev/null
	real	0m0,139s
	user	0m0,132s
	sys	0m0,006s

That's the time it takes here (SSD disks) to read all files under
Documentation/ABI, parse them and seek for a string.

That's about half of the time a python script takes to just import the
the sphinx modules and print its version, running at the same machine:

	$ time sphinx-build --version >/dev/null

	real	0m0,224s
	user	0m0,199s
	sys	0m0,024s
