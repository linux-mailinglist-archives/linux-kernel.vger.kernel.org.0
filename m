The note about getting re-written is referring to the fact that the trick
with the bulk free is that we build the detached freelist and then when
we do the cmpxchg it's getting (correctly) updated there.

But looking at this again, I realize this function still has a more
fundamental problem: walking the freelist like this means we actually
end up reversing the list so head and tail are no longer pointing
to the correct blocks. I was able to reproduce the issue by writing a
simple kmem_cache_bulk_alloc/kmem_cache_bulk_free function. I'm
guessing that the test of ping with an unusual size was enough to
regularly trigger a non-trivial bulk alloc/free.

The fix I gave before fixed part of the problem but not all of it.
At this point we're basically duplicating the work of the loop
below so I think we can just combine it. Was there a reason this
wasn't just combined in the first place?
