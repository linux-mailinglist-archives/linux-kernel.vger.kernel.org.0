The patch

   regulator: ab8500: Remove AB8505 USB regulator

has been applied to the regulator tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regulator.git for-5.5

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: ab8500: Remove AB8505 USB regulator

The USB regulator was removed for AB8500 in
commit 41a06aa738ad ("regulator: ab8500: Remove USB regulator").
It was then added for AB8505 in
commit 547f384f33db ("regulator: ab8500: add support for ab8505").

However, there was never an entry added for it in
ab8505_regulator_match. This causes all regulators after it
to be initialized with the wrong device tree data, eventually
leading to an out-of-bounds array read.

Given that it is not used anywhere in the kernel, it seems
likely that similar arguments against supporting it exist for
AB8505 (it is controlled by hardware).

Therefore, simply remove it like for AB8500 instead of adding
an entry in ab8505_regulator_match.

Fixes: 547f384f33db ("regulator: ab8500: add support for ab8505")
