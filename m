That's what I was thinking, but I realised that since the value may be
"unknown" even when the driver is able to tell the cable plug
orientation, there is no way for the userspace to know is the driver
able to supply the information or not. That is why I say the attribute
has to be hidden in cases where the driver really does not know the
orientation (like UCSI).

I'm really not a big fan of hidden attribute files, as they do make
things unpredictable for the userspace, but with information like
this, either we simply do not provide it to the userspace at all -
option that I'm all for if there is no real need for this - or we
hide the file with drivers that can not supply the information.

Puma actually already answered to this one:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/22/198

If I understood correctly, it would be purely informational. Puma,
please correct me if I'm wrong!

But if that is the case, and it is purely informational, then I don't
think we should add this attribute at all.
