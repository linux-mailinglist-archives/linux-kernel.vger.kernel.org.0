I meant I wasn't sure if the overall patch as that well tested ;-)

I see the value of the idea, but given kernel APIs are not stable
anyway, I prefer not to have things that we do not use yet. If someone
requires returning an error code in a future driver, they can change
it later on. I don't have a strong opinion on this anyway.

As Andy said, ideally patches/commits implement logical changes, i.e.
broken down as much as reasonably possible. For instance, changing the
interface from int/bool to an enum is probably a good idea, but it is
not related to the overall reorganization. In fact, it is orthogonal,
since it could be done either before or after the reorganization.

In general, it is much more easy to understand and review changes if
you split them. For instance, I noticed the enum change by chance, I
may have not noticed it; but if it was in a different patch, it would
have been clear for everyone. It also allows you to explain each
change individually in the commit message. Another of those "things"
is what Andy suggested. Of course, after you split things, it will
become easier to spot other things too, so we might have to do another
round etc.

A single patch for all the enums is fine. We could split those too,
but given the change has the same rationale, and is small enough, we
can put them together and share the commit message + is easier for you
and us to handle too. That is the "as much as reasonably possible"
part of the guideline ;-)

Hm... Try sending the series to yourself and see if you can reproduce it.

CC'ing Joe.

Even worse: at the moment I cannot test any of the drivers (and more
have been added over time). The 3 of them I could test are very
old/obsolete and I will be dropping them, so my role here is basically
"abstract" :-)

If there is anyone that can actually test most of the drivers in
auxdisplay and wants to help maintaining, it would be great, in fact.

You're welcome!
