commit 3ec440b52831eea172061c5db3d2990b22904863
Author: Neeraj Upadhyay <neeraju@codeaurora.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 19 11:50:52 2019 -0800

    rcu: Allow only one expedited GP to run concurrently with wakeups
    
    The current expedited RCU grace-period code expects that a task
    requesting an expedited grace period cannot awaken until that grace
    period has reached the wakeup phase.  However, it is possible for a long
    preemption to result in the waiting task never sleeping.  For example,
    consider the following sequence of events:
    
    1.      Task A starts an expedited grace period by invoking
            synchronize_rcu_expedited().  It proceeds normally up to the
            wait_event() near the end of that function, and is then preempted
            (or interrupted or whatever).
    
    2.      The expedited grace period completes, and a kworker task starts
            the awaken phase, having incremented the counter and acquired
            the rcu_state structure's .exp_wake_mutex.  This kworker task
            is then preempted or interrupted or whatever.
    
    3.      Task A resumes and enters wait_event(), which notes that the
            expedited grace period has completed, and thus doesn't sleep.
    
    4.      Task B starts an expedited grace period exactly as did Task A,
            complete with the preemption (or whatever delay) just before
            the call to wait_event().
    
    5.      The expedited grace period completes, and another kworker
            task starts the awaken phase, having incremented the counter.
            However, it blocks when attempting to acquire the rcu_state
            structure's .exp_wake_mutex because step 2's kworker task has
            not yet released it.
    
    6.      Steps 4 and 5 repeat, resulting in overflow of the rcu_node
            structure's ->exp_wq[] array.
    
    In theory, this is harmless.  Tasks waiting on the various ->exp_wq[]
    array will just be spuriously awakened, but they will just sleep again
    on noting that the rcu_state structure's ->expedited_sequence value has
    not advanced far enough.
    
    In practice, this wastes CPU time and is an accident waiting to happen.
    This commit therefore moves the rcu_exp_gp_seq_end() call that officially
    ends the expedited grace period (along with associate tracing) until
    after the ->exp_wake_mutex has been acquired.  This prevents Task A from
    awakening prematurely, thus preventing more than one expedited grace
    period from being in flight during a previous expedited grace period's
    wakeup phase.
