This is not fully true. printk_safe() helps only when
the first try_to_wake_up() is called from printk_safe() context.

I still do not see how this could help. Let's take the above
backtrace as example:

   <IRQ>
   console_trylock+0xe/0x60
   vprintk_emit+0xf1/0x320
   printk+0x4d/0x69
   __warn_printk+0x46/0x90
   native_smp_send_reschedule +0x2f/0x40
   check_preempt_curr+0x81/0xa0
   ttwu_do_wakeup+0x14/0x220
   try_to_wake_up+0x218/0x5f0
   pollwake+0x6f/0x90
   credit_entropy_bits+0x204/0x310
   add_interrupt_randomness+0x18f/0x210
   handle_irq+0x67/0x160
   do_IRQ+0x5e/0x130
   common_interrupt+0xf/0xf
   </IRQ>

We have the following chain of calls:

  + do_IRQ()
    ...
      + try_to_wake_up()    # takes p->pi_lock
        + ttwu_remote()     # takes rq lock
          + ttwu_do_wakeup()
	    + check_preempt_curr()
	      + native_smp_send_reschedule()
	        + __warn_printk()
		  + printk()
		    + vprintk_emit()
		      + console_trylock() # success
		      + console_unlock()
		        + up_console_sem()
			  + up() # wait list in not empty
			    + __up()
			      + wake_up_process()
			        + try_to_wake_up()

!BANG! Deadlock on p->pi_lock.

It does not matter if the nested try_to_wake_up() was called
under sem->lock or outside.

By other words. The patch removed one lockdep warning. But it just
just delayed the deadlock. It will not happen on sem->lock but
later on p->pi_lock.

I am repeating myself. But IMHO, the only solution is to introduce
printk deferred context and use it in WARN_DEFERRED().
