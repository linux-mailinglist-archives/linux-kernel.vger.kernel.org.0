OK, I see why it is in such a situation, the empty zones were not printed. 

I could still not get how vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio is set with
/proc/zoneinfo in the old initscripts, do you see any risk if not
filling and showing the ->lowmem_reserve[] of empty zone in
patch 2 and 3?  Thanks in advance.
