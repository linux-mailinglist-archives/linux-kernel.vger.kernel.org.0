Because the cable is always connected to the port on the back side, and 
sometimes the port in the front has ID 0, and the one in the back 1, and 
other times vice versa. We do not want to track that, and it would be 
convenient to just write to both ports.

Can such a device be created with udev or so?


Kind regards,
