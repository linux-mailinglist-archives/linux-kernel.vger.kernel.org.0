I submitted patches [1] to Xen community. But I didn't get it merged.
We made a change in device driver to disable MSI-X during guest OS
shutdown to mitigate the issue. But when guest or qemu was crashed, we
encountered this issue again. I have no plan to get back to these
patches. But if you want to fix the issue completely along what the
patches below did, please go ahead.
