Make sense, but for now we support only one G2H.
How we can provide this feature to the userspace?
Should we interface vsock with ip-link(8)?

I don't know if initially we can provide through sysfs a way to set the
netns of the only G2H loaded.

Agree.

I think that if CONFIG_NET_NS is not defined, all sockets and processes
are assigned to init_net and this RFC should work in this case, but I'll
try this case before v1.

I was thinking about the Kata's use case, I don't know if they launch the
VM in a netns and even the runtime in the host runs inside the same netns.

I'll send an e-mail to kata mailing list.

Thanks,
Stefano
