Right... smp_send_reschedule() has wider coverage, but even then there's
some hardware that just can't do it reasonably (e.g. pre-APIC x86).  So I
guess the options are:

1. Accept that such hardware might experience delayed grace period
completion in certain configurations,
2. Have such hardware check for need_resched in local_irq_enable() (not nice
if sharing a kernel build with hardware that doesn't need it), or
3. Forbid the sequence (enforced by debug checks).  Again, this would only
prohibit rcu_read_lock()/local_irq_disable()/rcu_read_unlock()/
local_irq_enable() *without* preempt disabling around the IRQ-disabled
region.

Yes, I already acknowledged that debug checks detecting the sequences should
come before the test removal (including this patch as an RFC at this point
was mainly meant as a demonstration of what's needed to get rcutorture to
pass), but it'd be nice to have some idea of whether there would be
opposition to the concept before coding up the checks.  I'd rather not
continue the state of "these sequences can blow up on RT and we don't know
if they exist or not" any longer than necessary.  Plus, only one of the
sequences is exclusively an RT issue (though it's the one with the worst
consequences).
