maybe I have a different interpretation of what "RCU" does.
let me explain it in my own words based on my knowledge about VRX200:
- in my own words it is a multi function device with the following
functionality:
- it contains two reset controllers (reset at 0x10, status 0x14 and
reset at 0x48, status at 0x24)
- it contains two USB2 PHYs (PHY registers at 0x18, ANA cfg at 0x38
and PHY registers at 0x34, ANA cfg at 0x3c)
- it contains the configuration for the two GPHY IP blocks (at 0x20 and 0x68)
- it contains endianness configuration registers (for PCI, PCIe, ...)
- it contains the watchdog boot status (whether the SoC was previously
reset by the WDT)
- maybe more, but I don't know anything else about it

we tried our best to document this in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mips/lantiq/rcu.txt

I'm not sure about the details of the RCU on the LGM SoCs:
if it contains more than just reset controllers then please let Rob
Herring (dt-bindings maintainer) know about this.
we may only have one chance to do it right, if we start with a
"broken" binding then devices with incompatible bootloaders etc. may
have already shipped
(in general: that is why the devicetree maintainers want to have all
device properties documented in the binding, even if the driver does
not support all of them yet)

I don't know either. depending on what the LGM SoCs need you can
change the "mask" property to the value that fits that SoC best

nice, it's good to see teamwork between hardware and software teams!

what about the _reset callback on the XRX350/XRX500/PRX300 SoCs - do
they only use level resets (_assert and _deassert) or are some reset
lines using reset pulses (_reset)?

when we wanted to switch from reset-lantiq.c to reset-intel-syscon.c
we still had to add support for the _reset callback as this is missing
in reset-intel-syscon.c currently
