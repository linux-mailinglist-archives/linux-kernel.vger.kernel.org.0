The BIOS has control over the feature control bit because, as we know,
the feature control register is usually locked down before handover to
the OS.

The driver will support only the case where the bit is set i.e. that
it can freely write to the MSRs MSR_IA32_SGXLEPUBKEYHASH{0, 1, 2, 3}.
It will refuse to initialize otherwise.

I'll make myself the sole author for this one as 98% of the effort in
this patch is really the commit message, which I rewrote for v22, and 2%
are the code changes (mechanical, peek at SDM).  This patch was squashed
from three patches, all like one line changes, and Kai was author of one
of them.

The next version will thus have only my SOB and author information will
be changed. I doubt anyone will complain if I do that.
