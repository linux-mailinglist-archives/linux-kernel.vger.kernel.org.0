This does not make any sense whatsoever.  vmalloc_user returns a kernel
address, it just does a GFP_USER instead of GFP_KERNEL allocation, which
is just accounting differences.

Again, you can't pass pointers obtained from vmalloc* to userspace.  You
can map the underlying pages into user pagetables, but is_vmalloc_addr
won't know that.  I think you guys need to read up on virtual memory 101
first and then come back and actually explain what you are trying to do.
