Hi Kim,

Sorry about being bit late.

AMD IBS captures pipeline latency data incase Fetch sampling like the
Fetch latency, tag to retire latency, completion to retire latency and
so on. Yes, Ops sampling do provide more data on load/store centric
information. But it also captures more detailed data for Branch instructions.
And we also looked at ARM SPE, which also captures more details pipeline
data and latency information.

We are thinking of using "pipeline" word instead of Hazard.

perf-mem is more of data centric in my opinion. It is more towards
memory profiling. So proposal here is to expose pipeline related
details like stalls and latencies.

Thanks for the review,
Ravi
