From VFIO p.o.v. the IOMMU UAPI data is opaque, it only needs to do two
things:
1. is the UAPI compatible?
2. what is the size to copy?

If you look at the version number, this is really a "version as size"
lookup, as provided by the helper function in this patch. An example
can be the newly introduced clone3 syscall.
https://lwn.net/Articles/792628/
In clone3, new version must have new size. The slight difference here
is that, unlike clone3, we have multiple data structures instead of a
single struct clone_args {}. And each struct has flags to enumerate its
contents besides size.

Besides breaching data abstraction, if VFIO has to check IOMMU flags to
determine the sizes, it has many combinations.

We also separate the responsibilities into two parts
1. compatibility - version, size by VFIO
2. sanity check - capability flags - by IOMMU

I think the latter matches what Christoph's comments. So we are in
agreement at the IOMMU level :)

For example:
During guest PASID bind, IOMMU driver operates on the data passed from
VFIO and check format & flags to take different code path.

#define IOMMU_PASID_FORMAT_INTEL_VTD	1
	__u32 format;
#define IOMMU_SVA_GPASID_VAL	(1 << 0) /* guest PASID valid */
	__u64 flags;
