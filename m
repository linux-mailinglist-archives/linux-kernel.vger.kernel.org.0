I am not against doing that, but it may break existing applications that
somehow need to read pagetypeinfo. That is why I didn't try to advocate
about changing protection.

I haven't tried to measure the performance impact yet. I did thought
about tracking nr_free for each of the migration types within a
free_area. That will require auditing the code to make sure that all the
intra-free_area migrations are properly accounted for. I can work on it
if people prefer this alternative.

Yes, it is still theoretically possible. I will take a further look at
having per-migrate type nr_free. BTW, there is one more place where the
free lists are being iterated with zone lock held - mark_free_pages().
