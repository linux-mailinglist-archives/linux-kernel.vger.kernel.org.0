I guess it's also possible that the problem is with tcpm.c instead of
fusb302.c. tcpm.c provides the USB PD state matchines. Guenter! Can
you take a look at this?

Both tcpm.c and fusb302.c create debugfs entries that have a more
detailed log about things that are happening. Can you check what you
have in those (when you boot with the mains cable plugged it)?

        % mount debugfs -t debugfs /sys/kernel/debug
        % cat /sys/kernel/debug/tcpm*
        % cat /sys/kernel/debug/fusb302/*

Which kernel are you running by the way?
