Ok, so we know it's within the imbalance threshold where a NUMA node can
be left idle.

When the initial spreading was prevented, it was for pipelines mainly --
even basic shell scripts. In that case it was observed that a shell would
fork/exec two tasks connected via pipe that started on separate nodes and
had allocated remote data before being pulled close. The processes were
typically too short lived for NUMA balancing to fix it up by exec time
the information on where the fork happened was lost.  See 2c83362734da
("sched/fair: Consider SD_NUMA when selecting the most idle group to
schedule on"). Now the logic has probably been partially broken since
because of how SD_NUMA is now treated but the concern about spreading
wide prematurely remains.
