A binding to a clock, regulator, etc without which the device could
still operate. Best example is clock providers with cyclic
dependencies. One of them definitely can operate without the other
(but the reverse is not true).

No. I'll repeat my statement from earlier:
I'm more than happy to do this if the maintainers can accept this as a
solution, but then we need to agree that we need an override property
if the implicit dependency isn't a mandatory dependency. Clock
providers are just one good example case of devices with cyclic
dependencies. We need to at least have depends-on act as a way to
override implicit dependencies when they don't match the real
dependency.

Based on his earlier email, my understanding is that he doesn't care
about the probe ordering being inefficient because he doesn't expect
it to add much to boot time and sees that as an OS issue and not a DT
issue. I believe this specific proposal from his is to explain why we
don't need a "depends-on" property (and I'm saying it's only partly
correct).

No, the comment about regulators was just about how unfriendly that
binding is for parsing dependencies. That has nothing to do with the
general design though (which is, do we need depends-on?).
