I can only guess that the thinking probably was that e.g. external
dumping (by the tool stack) would be more reliable (including but
not limited to this meaning less change of state from when the
original crash reason was detected) than having the domain dump
itself.

See above.

True. I guess more control over the behavior needs to be given to
the admin, as either approach has its up- and downsides
