So to show what I mean: I'm trying to reserve a crash kernel region on a
box here. I tried:

crashkernel=64M@16M

as it is stated in Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt.

Box said:

[    0.000000] crashkernel reservation failed - memory is in use.

Oh great.

Then I tried:

crashkernel=64M@64M

Box said:

[    0.000000] crashkernel reservation failed - memory is in use.

So I simply did:

crashkernel=64M

and the box said:

[    0.000000] Reserving 64MB of memory at 3392MB for crashkernel (System RAM: 16271MB)

So I could've gone a long time poking at the memory to find a suitable
address.

So do you see what I mean with making this as user-friendly and as
robust as possible?

In this case I don't care about *where* my crash kernel is - I only want
to have one loaded *somewhere*.

And the same strategy should be applied to other reservation attempts
- we should try hard to reserve and if we cannot reserve, then try an
alternating range.

I even think that

crashkernel=X@Y

should not simply fail if Y is occupied but keep trying and say

[    0.000000] Reserving 64MB of memory at alternative address 3392MB for crashkernel (System RAM: 16271MB)

and only fail when the user doesn't really want the kernel to try hard
by booting with

crashkernel=X@Y,strict

But that's for another day.
