I recently dropped that patch from the queue because the workqueue
problem vanished.

This makes sense.

No, I doubt there is any need to use the `expedited' version. The
problem is that it increases latencies.

That patch disables RCU_FAST_NO_HZ and claims that it has something to
do with a timer_list timer and IRQ-off section. We couldn't schedule
timers from IRQ-off regions but not anymore. Only del_timer_sync() can't
be invoked from IRQ-off regions.
I just booted a box with this enabled together with NO_HZ/ NO_HZ_FULL
and I not complains yet. So I might drop thatâ€¦

I have no idea. I guess most people don't know what it does and stay
with the default. It become default on RT once a few people complained
that they run OOM during boot on some "memory contrained systems". That
option avoided it.
So yes, will make it depend on RT.

Correct. Maybe we could invoke a different schedule() primitiv so RCU is
aware that this is a sleeping spinlock and not a regular sleeping lock.

wonderful.

Hmmm. I though this was already upstream.
That said, we can now schedule work from a preempt_disable() section but
I still like the negative diffstat here :)

I might get rid of the local_lock in srcu. Will have to check.

Thank you Paul.
