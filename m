We are clearly not going anywhere.

I partitioned the patches to make your maintainer life easier and help 
the integration of SoundWire across two trees. All I get is negative 
feedback, grand-standing, and zero comments on actual changes.

For the record, I am mindful of reviewer/maintainer workload, and I did 
contact you in September to check your availability and provided a 
pointer to initial code changes. I did send a first version a week prior 
to your travel/vacation, I resend another version when you were back and 
waited yet another two weeks to resend a second version. I also 
contacted Takashi, Mark and you to suggest this code partition, and did 
not get any pushback. It's not like I am pushing stuff down your throat, 
I have been patient and considerate.

Please start with the patches "soundwire: code hardening and 
suspend-resume support" and come back to this interface description when 
you have reviewed these changes. It's not detective work, it's working 
around the consequences of having separate trees for Audio and SoundWire.
