Except your change was not a simplification.   Your change was
a substitution to do the work of filling in struct kernel_siginfo in 4
locations instead of just 2.

The only simplification came from not using unsafe_put_user.  Which is
valid but has nothing to do with struct waitid_info.

I just double checked the definitions in signal_types.h and
uapi/asm-generic/siginfo.h and there is definitely padding on 64bit.
So yes barring magic compiler plug ins it is a bug.

Then I am afraid I have not expressed myself well.

When I read through this patch I saw.
- A bug when dealing with struct kernel_siginfo.
- A substitution from of struct waitid_info to struct kernel_siginfo.
- An actual simplification in replacing several unsafe_put_user calls
  with copy_siginfo_to_user.
- A gratuitous change in change the order of several of the statements.
- No simplification in the logic of do_wait.

Or in short I saw you did "s/struct waitid_info/struct kernel_siginfo/"
and introduced bugs.  Further you increased the number of locations that
we need to be very careful with struct kernel_siginfo from 2 to 4.


For myself I am extremely sensitive to people taking a cavalier attitude
to using siginfo.  So that we have a chance of maintaining that code I
have been steadily cleaning it up for the last year or two.  I hope
things are better now.  I think I have gotten the core code that
manipulates struct siginfo from something that no one had the time to
read through and understand to something that a person can look at and
in a couple hours understand the nuances of.

But it still remains the case that we must be much more careful with
struct siginfo than we are with other structures.  It still remains
entirely too easy to fill it out wrong unless you are paying close
attention to all of the details.


Or in other words I think if you simplified your cleanup something like
below it would be a good cleanup.
