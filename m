We probably will not have more than one device handled by the driver,
but I did this
at the request of Dmitry. He wanted to just do it right the first time so no one
would have to fix it if in the future a second device was needed. FYI,
I did the same
thing for the events driver at https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1078461/.

I just tried to find the email thread and/or the review on the
Chromium Gerrit that
documents this, but I couldn't find it. It must have been a private
message, so sorry I
can't link you to it.

Dmitry, am I interpreting your reasoning correctly?

Thanks,
Nick
