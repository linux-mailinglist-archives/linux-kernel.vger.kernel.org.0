Yes, I should have highlighted that. The series appears to improve a
number of areas while being performance neutral with respect to SD_NUMA.
If this turns out to be wrong in some case, it should be semi-obvious even
if the locality looks ok. It'll be a headline regression with increased
NUMA pte scanning and increased frequency of migrations indicating that
NUMA balancing is taken excessive corrective action. I'll know it when
I see it :P
