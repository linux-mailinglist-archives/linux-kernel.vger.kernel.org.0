Hi Tetsuo,

The simplest and fastest you may try is to request testing on another,
simpler bug. I have not seen any other signals suggesting that patch
testing in general is somehow broken.

You may also try on the exact commit the bug was reported, because
usb-fuzzer is tracking branch, things may change there.

If the old bug was fixed, but syzbot is not aware, new bugs being
piled into the same bucket is exactly what will happen. So that's
definitely possible.
