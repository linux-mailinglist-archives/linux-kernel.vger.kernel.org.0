Why not solve the older kernel problem the way I do with drivers for many 
Realtek devices by creating a GitHub project with the kernel API changes 
properly handled by ifdef statements? See the lwfinger projects. That solves the 
problem of users without the skills needed to adjust to kernel changes without 
burdening the entire Linux kernel with these bloated drivers. There are no 
reasons that a wifi driver should require 200K lines of code!
