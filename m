well for now.. until someone thinks its a good idea to follow linux

I've gone through all the flashes which were supported (at that time), 
all
which have non-volatile have the SPI_NOR_UNPROTECT flag. Also some ESMT
parts have non-volatile flags.

But this patch doesn't restore the state as of before 3e0930f109e7. 
Before
this commit any Atmel, Intel and SST flashes were unlocked. With this
patch only the ones are unlocked which have volatile bits.

I'll send a v3 which introduces a new kernel config option with three
choices:
  (1) Disable WP on any flashes (legacy behaviour)
  (2) Disable WP on flashes w/ volatile protection bits
  (3) Keep write protection as is

(1) is enabled by default. One should choose (2) though, because that is
the sane thing to do and (3) is for completeness and the special case if
anyone will actually keep the write protection on flashes with volatile
bits.

I still don't think a kernel parameter is a good idea because you may
miss it and end up with your flash being unprotected.

And i still hope that sometime, (2) may be the default..
