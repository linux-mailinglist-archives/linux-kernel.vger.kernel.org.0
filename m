You don't support hashes? If so, this isn't compatible with UEFI
Secure Boot and we shouldn't try to make it look like UEFI Secure
Boot.

Hash-based revocation is in active use in the UEFI world - to the best
of my knowledge, all existing dbx entries are hashes with the
exception of the invalidation of the Microsoft Windows 2010 CA.

dbt is currently only used for validation at the firmware level - the
way grub and kernel signatures are currently managed means it doesn't
make a huge amount of sense to use it in shim, but it would probably
be reasonable to extend shim's validation to include dbt.

Ok, this is not what we expect from UEFI systems. I'm strongly against
providing what looks like the same ABI on multiple platforms but
carrying subtle differences between those platforms - it's guaranteed
to break tooling in unexpected ways.

I believe that this is also a violation of expectations.

Ok, in this scenario I don't understand why you wouldn't just want the
intermediates in PK. Or, put another way - if you have a business
justification for three layers of hierarchy, what do you do when
someone has a business justification for four? The three layer
hierarchy represents the weirdness of the PC industry where you have
Microsoft needing to be in KEK (because they need to be able to issue
updates to machines from multiple vendors) but not wanting to be in PK
(because vendors don't want Microsoft to have ultimate control over
their systems). If it weren't for this conflict, we'd just have a two
layer hierarchy, and if some other aspect of the market had evolved
over time we'd have a four layer hierarchy.

dbx entries come from Microsoft, so we need the KEK layer so Microsoft
can update dbx. If Microsoft didn't need to update dbx then we'd leave
Microsoft out of KEK, and then KEK and PK would be the same and we'd
be able to get rid of KEK.
