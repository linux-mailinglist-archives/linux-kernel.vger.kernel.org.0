The above is for two parameters, and is being called before the
function with those two parameters. The jited_bpf_prog will be called
with those two parameters as well, but it may also clobber them. Then
we need to restore those two parameters before calling the original
function.

It's injecting the jited_bpf_prog to be called when the probed function
is called, with the same parameters as the probed function.

my_probed_function
  call trampoline


trampoline
  save parameters
  call jited_bpf_prog (with same parameters)
  restore paremeters
  ret

Jumps back to the my_probed_function, where my_probed_function is
clueless it was just interrupted.

No need to save any clobbered registers but the parameters, as the
jited_bpf_prog needs to save any registers that it clobbers just like
the my_probed_function saves its.
