So, I wrote the iocost switching patch and don't have a strong
interest in whether bfq prefix should get dropped or not.  However, I
gotta point out that flipping interface this way is way out of the
norm.

In the previous release cycle, the right thing to do was dropping the
bfq prefix but that wasn't possible because bfq's interface wasn't
compatible at that point and didn't made to be compatible in time.
Non-obviously different interface with the same name is a lot worse
than giving it a new name, so the only acceptable course of action at
that point was keeping the bfq prefix.

Now that the interface has already been published in a released
kernel, dropping the prefix would be something extremely unusual as
there would already be users who will be affected by the interface
flip-flop.  We sometimes do change interfaces but I'm having a
difficult time seeing the overriding rationales in this case.

Thanks.
