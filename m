The answer is yes. I have recently been alerted to a problem with
paranoid=2 and the
popular rr debugger (https://rr-project.org/). This debugger uses
several perf_events
features, including profiling of PMU events and tracepoints
(context-switches). With
paranoid=2, it does not work anymore. We would need a privilege between regular
user and admin to make it work again. Note that context switches
tracepoint is only
applied to self (not system-wide).
