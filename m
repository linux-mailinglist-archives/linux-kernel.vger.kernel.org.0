I understand your point but I have to admit that I don't really see how 
to make it work together with the test which require those definitions.

Also I realize that there is a duplicate with definitions introduced in 
the selftests but I kind of simplified the macros I'm using to get rid 
of what wasn't useful to me at the moment. (mainly the loop labels and 
parameter injections in the asm statement)
I understand what both Mark and Arnaldo are saying about moving it out 
of perf so that it is not duplicated but my question is whether it is a 
good thing to do as is since it is not exactly the same content as 
what's in the selftests.

I hope you can understand my concerns and I'd like to hear your opinions 
on that matter.

Thanks,
