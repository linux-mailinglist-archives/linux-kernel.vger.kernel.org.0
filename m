Oh, I didn't realise that. Is there a MAINTAINERS update someplace? If I
run:

$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f drivers/firmware/qcom_scm-64.c

in linux-next, I get:

Andy Gross <agross@kernel.org> (maintainer:ARM/QUALCOMM SUPPORT)
linux-arm-msm@vger.kernel.org (open list:ARM/QUALCOMM SUPPORT)
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (open list)
