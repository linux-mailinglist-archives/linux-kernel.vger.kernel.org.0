Because I really think the BEGIN/END interface is error-prone, I was
curious if I could make this work:

         preempt_disable();
         {
                  ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER_SCOPED(var);
                  do_sth();
                  raw_cpu_write(var, 1);
                  do_sth_else();
         }
         preempt_enable();

Since all compilers that support TSAN instrumentation support
attribute "cleanup", this works for KCSAN. Half-baked patch:
  https://github.com/melver/linux/commit/d5a510a80b9755909d8b2ccc7bcfdeac99fc0080

Since it's not too intrusive, I'd be fine including this. But I think
you have to come up with the use-cases. :-)

I can send the patch once I'm done with it.
