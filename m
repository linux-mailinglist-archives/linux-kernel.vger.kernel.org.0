I dont like option 1, because I am not convinced that this is a HW
description to be put in DT.  IIUC, problem is more of what to do with
locking configuration that is done before Linux comes up(either in
previous boot or by bootloader or POR default). Current code just
discards it and unlocks entire flash.
But proposal is not to touch those bits at probe time and leave this
upto userspace to handle.

Adding a Kconfig does not scale well for multi-platform builds. There
would not be a way to have protection enabled on one platform but
disabled on other. Does not scale for multiple flashes either

Option 3 sounds least bad among all. If module param can be designed to
be a string then, we could control locking behavior to be per flash
using flash name.
