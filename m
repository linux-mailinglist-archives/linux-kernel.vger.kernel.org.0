Oh I see. Until now we considered than running into the kernel (between user/guest/idle)
is supposed to be short but there can be specific places where it doesn't apply.

I'm wondering if, more than just providing wrappers, this shouldn't be entirely
driven by RCU using the tick_set_dep_cpu()/tick_clear_dep_cpu() at appropriate timings.

I don't want to sound like I'm trying to put all the work on you :p  It's just that
the tick shouldn't know much about RCU, it's rather RCU that is a client for the tick and
is probably better suited to determine when a CPU becomes annoying with its extended grace
period.

Arming a CPU timer could also be an alternative to tick_set_dep_cpu() for that.

What do you think?
