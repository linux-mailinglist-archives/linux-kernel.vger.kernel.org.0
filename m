Yeah, having run the test, stranding only 1 ms per cpu rather than 5
doesn't help if you only have 10 ms of quota and even 10 threads/cpus.
The slack timer isn't important in this test, though I think it probably
should be changed.

Decreasing min_cfs_rq_runtime helps, but would mean that we have to pull
quota more often / always. The worst case here I think is where you
run/sleep for ~1ns, so you wind up taking the lock twice every
min_cfs_rq_runtime: once for assign and once to return all but min,
which you then use up doing short run/sleep. I suppose that determines
how much we care about this overhead at all.

Removing expiration means that in the worst case period and quota can be
effectively twice what the user specified, but only on very particular
workloads.

I think we should at least think about instead lowering
min_cfs_rq_runtime to some smaller value.
