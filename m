But the kernel command line is a command line. Would you mean encoding the 
structured setting in binary format with base64 and pass it? :(

I found following discussion in etherpad log, https://elinux.org/Device_tree_plumbers_2016_etherpad

If you have data that the kernel does not have a good way to get, that's OK to put into DT.

    Operating points are OK - but should still be structured well.

This sounds like if it is structured well, and there are no other way,
we will be able to use DT as a channel.

Hmm, it's a kind of communication with the operator of the boot loader, since there
is an admin or developer behind it. I think the comminication is to communicate
with that human. Then if they intend to trace boot process, that is a kind of
communication.

Yeah, that's right.

No, if I can use DT, I can choose one of them while boot up.
That will be a big difference.
(Of course for that purpose, I should work on boot loader to support
DT overlay)

Yes, and for me, that sounds like just a reinvention of the wheel.
If I can reuse devicetree infrastructure, it is easily done (as I
implemented in this series. It's just about 500LOC (and YAML document)

I can clone drivers/of/ code only for that new communication channel,
but that makes no one happy. :(

Why should we so limit the availability of even a small corner of existing
open source software...?

Thank you,
