Here is another one for task numa migration. We saw significant latency
improvement of workload sysbench MYSQL+gemmbench, for the overloaded case
on a 8-node system, the latency is reduced from 93.78ms to 28.36ms. So I
think it's worth to post this twist to draw more ideas and better solutions.

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] sched/numa: don't migrate task if cookie not match

For the NUMA load balance, don't migrate task to the CPU whose core
cookie does not match with task's cookie
