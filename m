FWIW, that's pretty much how Pratik and Jordan explained it to me - the 
LLC sits directly in front of memory and is more or less transparent, 
although it might treat CPU and device accesses slightly differently (I 
don't remember exactly how the inner cacheablility attribute interacts). 
Certain devices don't get much benefit from the LLC, hence the desire 
for finer-grained control of their outer allocation policy to avoid more 
thrashing than necessary. Furthermore, for stuff in the 
video/GPU/display area certain jobs benefit more than others, hence the 
desire to go even finer-grained than a per-device control in order to 
maximise LLC effectiveness.
