Are you sure? I can see:

     58.30 ±  2%     -20.2%      46.53        filebench.sum_bytes_mb/s

which implies to me previously the throughput was 58 MB/s and after the
commit it was 46 MB/s?

Anyway, in my testing that commit made no difference in that benchmark
whasoever (getting around 97 MB/s for each thread before and after the
commit).
