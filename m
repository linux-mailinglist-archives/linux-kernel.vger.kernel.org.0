Would moving entry.S's context_tracking_user_exit() call to be before do_debug_exception()
also fix this?

I don't know the reason its done 'after' debug exception handling. Its always been like
this: commit 6c81fe7925cc4c42 ("arm64: enable context tracking").

How come? If you interrupted an SError or pseudo-nmi, it already is. Those paths should
all be painted no-kprobe, but I'm sure there are gaps. The hw-breakpoints can almost
certainly hook them.

Can we interrupt printk()? Do we need printk_nmi_enter()? ... What about ftrace?

Because SError and pseudo-nmi can interrupt interrupt-masked code, we describe them as
NMI. The only difference here is these exceptions are synchronous.


I suspect we should make these debug exceptions nmi for EL1. We can then use this for the
kprobe-re-entrance stuff so the pre/post hooks don't get run if they interrupted something
also described as NMI.
