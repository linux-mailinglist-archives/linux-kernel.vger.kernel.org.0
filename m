Thanks for pointing that out.
snd_pcm_drop() will be called right before accessing `opts->hw_free`
and device dma will be stopped by SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_STOP.
And snd_pcm_prepare() will be called when the device is not running.
So synchronize_irq() should be enough for both of them.

I have a patch like this now in intel8x0:

If that looks good to you, I can upload the patch to pw as well.
Then we can upstream the intel8x0 patch and the first change I made in
this series (the elapse one).
Does that sound good to you?

Thanks,
Paul
