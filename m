To really test it, it'd be nice to see some HS200 eMMC cards enumerate
OK.  Specifically the patch adjusts the error handling and the place
where that happens mostly is during tuning.

I'll also try to find some time today to check a peach_pit or a
peach_pi.  I think I saw one in the pile near my desk so if it isn't
in too bad of a shape I can give mainline a shot on it.
