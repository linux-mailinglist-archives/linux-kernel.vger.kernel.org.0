That would make sense to me. Maybe doing it all in a single commit is
too hard to review or bisect, but having a small series that
duplicates the interval tree header at the start and removes the old
(closed intervals) version at the end looks like it would work IMO.

All right. So, my preference would be if we can use a version of
interval trees that would work natively with half open intervals, as
we discussed above. But, if that seems like too much change, I would
also be ready to approve a version of pat_interval.c that would adjust
the interval endpoint to compensate for the interval tree's use of
closed intervals. I think either way, I can't approve the current
version as it's too much of an in-between which makes it hard to
follow IMO.

That would be ideal; hopefully you don't see the vma_interval_tree
thing as blocking this approach ?
