Sorry about that. That was my first time replying on the LKML and I
must have made a mistake when I invoked git send-email.

My main concern here was waiting for the BIO request to complete but
submit_bio_wait() that you pointed out below should address that.

Thanks, I should have noticed that.

I will try that, possibily all as a single patch if it looks simple
enough so that there is no need to convert from buffer heads to
bio_vecs. Let me know though if you feel strongly about having this as
two patches.

Thanks for explaining all of this. I will make the changes you
suggested and will report back with a new patch.
