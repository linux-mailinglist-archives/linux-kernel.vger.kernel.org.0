Sorry Suzuki, I initially interpreted the question independently from
the context and only thought about cases where they are working
correctly but users might want to disable the use of them.

In this case, I don't see any harm in adding a command line parameter
to disable the use of the unit, even if it's only to support firmware
that does not support AMU at all, rather than the implementation being
broken.

I'm not really sure how common bad firmware would be. I suppose that
firmware as bad as to cause firmware panics and lockups would be quite
rare, but scenarios where firmware might not properly support AMU and
result in kernel lockups could be more often, and this would handle
both.

Thank you,
Ionela.
