Exactly.

Ok, clearly we are not discussing the actual IO access.  The only issue
is how to handle the memory resource management.

And yes, serial8250 requires "the parent" to not request the resources.
But by doing so, it gets in the way of the mfd-core way of splitting a
properly requested resource.

If I may, could I get you to discuss this with Lee Jones?

As I read both of your comments in this thread, you are not aligned on
how mfd drivers should handle resources.  And in that case, one of you
are most likely more right than the other, and if Lee is right, I seem
to be unable to convince you about that.

That comment seems quite misleading.  I am quote certain that the uart
registers which are part of BAR 0 is not more shared between subdevices
than the uart registers in BAR 0 in my case.

But BAR 0 as a whole is shared between subdevices.  But BAR 0 can be
(is) split in parts that are exclusive to one subdevice.  The only
difference I see is that I don't have any registers accessed directly by
the mfd driver.
