Alexei, Masami,

Thanks for your meaningful input.
If we know in advance that it still can crash the system in some cases and on 
some archs, even though root fully controls delegation thru CAP_SYS_PERFMON,
such delegation looks premature until the crashes are avoided. So it looks like
access to eBPF for CAP_SYS_PERFMON privileged processes is the subject for
a separate patch set.

Thanks,
Alexey
