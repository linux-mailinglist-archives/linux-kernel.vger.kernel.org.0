I understand the concern of expanding the interface and resolving the
problem within kernel but there are genuine use-cases which can be
fulfilled by these interfaces. We have a distributed caching service
which manages the caches in anon pages and their hotness. It is
preferable to drop a cold cache known to the application in the user
space on near stall/oom/memory_pressure then let the kernel swap it
out and face a stall on fault as the caches are replicated and other
nodes can serve it. For such workloads kernel reclaim does not help.
What would be your recommendation for such a workload. I can envision
memory.high + PSI notification but note that these are based on stalls
which the application wants to avoid.
