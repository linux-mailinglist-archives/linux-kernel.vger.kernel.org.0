Because I want to keep both heuristics.
This seems most sane way of interaction between them.

Unfortunately even this patch is slightly broken.
Condition prev->anon_vma->parent == pvma->anon_vma doesn't guarantee that
prev vma has the same set of anon-vmas like current vma.
I.e. anon_vma_clone(vma, prev) might be not enough for keeping connectivity.
Building such case isn't trivial job but I see nothing that could prevent it.
