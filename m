Thanks for clarifying the point. I see the difference in our view points.

The way I see it, on the system where the device must operate in IRQ
mode to meet performance requirements, the DRIVER would choose to
always -EPROBE_DEFER till it gets the IRQ. Or if it's BSD or Windows
or whatever other theoretical OS that is trying to use the same DT
blob, it'll follow whatever mechanism that OS provides for waiting for
the IRQ to become available.
On the system where not having the IRQ is okay, the DRIVER would not
EPROBE_DEFER and just go to using polling mode.
In both these cases I don't expect the depends-on to list the IRQ provider.

I have more to say but I'll say that in the RESEND thread as a reply
to your other email.
