Hmm, so I gave a bad example, here is a better example:

fib_get_table calls hlist_for_each_entry_rcu()
hlist_for_each_entry_rcu calls rcu_dereference_raw().

This is perfectly Ok to be called under rtnl_mutex. However rcu_dererence_raw
in hlist_for_each_entry_rcu has no way of knowing that the rtnl_mutex held is
sufficient for the protection since it is not directly called by the caller.

I am almost sure I saw other examples of rcu_dereference_raw being called
this way as well.

I was trying to make an "automatic" lockdep check for all this, but it is
quite hard to do so without passing down lockdep experessions down a call
chain thus complicating all such callchains.

Further I don't think code can trivially be converted from
rcu_dereference_raw to rcu_dereference_protected even if the protection being
offered is known, since the former does not do sparse checking and the latter
might trigger false sparse checks in case the pointer in concern is protected
both by RCU and non-RCU methods. I believe this is why you removed sparse
checking from rcu_dereference_raw as well:

Ok ;-). About the names of the APIs, I thought of leaving rcu_dereference_raw
and its callers intact, and just rename:

 * hlist_for_each_entry_rcu_notrace
 * rcu_dereference_raw_notrace

to:
 * hlist_for_each_entry_rcu_sparse
 * rcu_dereference_raw_sparse

The _sparse would stand for "sparse checking". However I am open to better
names..

Such renaming would avoid confusion and keep the fact about sparse checking
less ambiguous.

thanks!
