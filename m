That is the usual "write enable" mechanism. while marketing may seem to 
see
that as write protection, I do not, esp. not hardware write protection.

What about changing it to the following?
"These have the QE bit hard strapped to 1, thus don't the /HOLD and /WP
pins".

You mean ef6016 and ef8016, yes that is correct. My point was there is 
no
"w25q15jwm": If linux kernel messages write "detected w25q32jwm" nobody 
will
know what that part is, because there is no such part. There is a 
w25q32jwim
or maybe w25q32jwXm but no w25q32jwm.

And naming the Q version w25q32jwq is not possible, because the id is 
shared
with the w25q32dw, which is already in spi-nor.c.

I know that and get your point. But I fear that this will confuse 
others.

Well, I've did that last week. But TBH I don't know if I want to go down 
that
road. Its not only the names, its also the flags. There is a mix of old 
and
new flashes in spi-nor.c; for example the newer ones supports dual and 
quad
mode. But the crux is, Macronix shares the same id over different 
generations
of the flash chip. For example look at the MX25L8005 (as it is supported 
in
the kernel) [1]. It doesn't support dual I/O mode. But the newer 
generation
MX25L8006E, which has the same id, supports it. So even I could come up 
with
something to fix it, I doubt it will be accepted without testing.

Because as pointed out in the Winbond example you cannot distiguish 
between
W25Q32DW and W25Q32JWIQ; and in the Macronix example between MX25L8005 
and
MX25L8006E. Thus my reasoning was to show only the common part, ie 
W25Q32
or MX25L80 which should be the same for this particular ID. Like I said, 
I'd
prefer showing an ambiguous name instead of a wrong one. But then you 
may
have different IDs with the same ambiguous name.
