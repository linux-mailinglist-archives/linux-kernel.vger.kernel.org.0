It's fine to use the shutdown == true in this path as well, but I just wanted
to understand what problem it was fixing. It doesn't sound like your scenario
is going to end up setting CC.SHN, so the only thing the shutdown should
accomplish is flushing pending IO, but we already call kill_queues() right
after the nvme_dev_disable(), so that part should be okay.
