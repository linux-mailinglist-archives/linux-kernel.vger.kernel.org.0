'_nosync()' can be used to patch the following instructions:

	B		(JMP)
	BL		(CALL)
	BRK		(Breakpoint)
	SVC, HVC, SMC	(System calls)
	NOP
	ISB		(Pipe flush)

Our kprobes implementation prefers to single-step the instruction in an
XOL buffer (we should do this by placing a BRK at the end of the buffer,
but we currently use hardware step which is overkill imo). For instructions
that are performing a PC-relative operation (e.g. an immediate branch),
we can't run from the XOL buffer because we'd go to the wrong place; these
instructions are therefore emulated in software...

... in a manner similar to what you describe here. See simulate_b_bl(),
although it's thankfully simpler than what x86 seems to have to do. This
approach means we can avoid emulating the vast majority of the instruction
set.

No thanks ;)

On arm64, we patch a *lot* and I think stop_machine() is the only safe
choice for things like the alternatives, where we patch all sorts of things
(cache maintenance, I/O accessors, atomics (until recently), user accessors.
Even then, we have to provide our own synchronisation in
__apply_alternatives_multi_stop() and use special cache-flushing
(clean_dcache_range_nopatch()) to avoid the possibility of running the code
that we're modifying. Outside of the alternatives, I'd still be wary about
recursive debug exceptions if we were to patch jump labels with breakpoints.

Backing up though, I think I'm missing details about what this thread is
trying to achieve. You're adding perf events so that coresight trace can
take into account modifications of the kernel text, right? If so:

  * Does this need to take into account more than just jump_label()?
  * What consistency guarantees are needed by userspace? It's not clear to
    me how it correlates the new event with execution on other CPUs. Is this
    using timestamps or something else?
  * What about module loading?

Finally, the whole point of the '_nosync()' stuff is that we don't have
to synchronise. Therefore, there is a window where you really can't tell
whether the instruction has been updated from the perspective of another
CPU.
