I'm almost sure we got this already. If I'm not mistaken, the solution
is to add the encoding line after shebang. Looking at 
Documentation/sphinx/maintainers_include.py (patch 2/2), the script
starts with:

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
	# -*- coding: utf-8; mode: python -*-
	# pylint: disable=R0903, C0330, R0914, R0912, E0401

But, as I pointed before, the SPDX header at the wrong place is causing the 
crash, as the encoding line should be the second line, not the third one,
e. g.:

	#!/usr/bin/env python
	# -*- coding: utf-8; mode: python -*-
	# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
	# pylint: disable=R0903, C0330, R0914, R0912, E0401

I also suspect that this would happen even with python3, depending on
how LC_ALL, LANG, ... are set on the distro you use.

Thanks,
Mauro
