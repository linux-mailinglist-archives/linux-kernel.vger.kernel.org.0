I think Alexander means this line "But, when doing balloon inflation in 
QEMU, QEMU actually does hole punch
or MADV_DONTNEED in base page size granulairty if hugetlbfs is not 
used." He thought it may confuse people thought this is QEMU issue. 
Actually, according to the later discussion, it sounds like a limitation 
from balloon driver, which just can deal with 4K size page. So, we could 
rephrase it to "Balloon inflation is handled in base page size."
