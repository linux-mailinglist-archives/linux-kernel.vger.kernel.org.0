OK, so, this is more or less what I had in my v3 patch before sending
this email. So, it looks that I am on good track. Great! Though I am not
sure that we should have magic for chunked objects. If yes could you
explain why? I would just leave len for chunked objects.

Well, your proposals are more cryptic, especially the second one, than
mine but I tend to agree that more *RANDOM* magics are better. So,
I would choose "LToP" if you decipher it for me. Linux Top?
