__padata_free unconditionally frees pd, so a padata job might choke on it
later.  padata_do_parallel calls seem safe because they use RCU, but it seems
possible that a job could call padata_do_serial after the instance is gone.

Best idea I can think of now is to indicate the instance has been freed in the
pd before dropping the initial pd ref in __padata_free, and use that to bail
out early from places that touch the instance or its data (workqueues say).
Will think more on this.


(By the way, I was on leave longer than anticipated, so thanks for picking up
my slack on this patch.  I plan to repost my other padata fixes soon.)
