I'll take these commit text suggestions if we decide to revert the

I intentionally chose "Mark device..." because that's a better
description of the semantics of the function instead of trying to
describe the implementation. Whether I'm using a linked list or some
other data structure should not be the one line documentation of a
function. Unless the function is explicitly about operating on that
specific data structure.

I didn't know that the first one line comment could span multiple
lines. Good to know.


>     * Scan all consumer devices in the devicetree.

This function doesn't have anything to do with devicetree. I've
intentionally kept all OF related parts out of the driver/core because
I hope that other busses can start using this feature too. So I can't
take this bit.

Honestly, I don't think this is any better than what I already have.

I kinda agree that it could afford a better name. The current name is
too similar to device_links_check_suppliers() and I never liked that.

Maybe device_link_add_missing_suppliers()?

I don't think we need "links" repeated twice in the function name.
With this suggestion, what side effect is hidden in your opinion? That
the fully linked consumer is removed from the "waiting for suppliers"
list?

Maybe device_link_try_removing_from_wfs()?

I'll wait for us to agree on a better name here before I change this.

I'll chalk this up to you having a long day or forgetting your coffee
:) list_del_init() does both of those things because needs_suppliers
is the node and wait_for_suppliers is the list.

There is no list of needed suppliers.

I think what I wrote is just as clear.

Why are you removing the "perhaps multiple times" part? that's true
and that's how some of the other ops are documented.

Sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Can you please explain what you are
trying to say? of_link_to_suppliers() is just one implementation of
add_links(). The comment above is try for any bus trying to implement
add_links().

add_links() was an intentional decision. There's no requirement that
the bus should only create links from this device to its suppliers. If
the bus also knows the consumers of this device (dev), then it
can/should add those too. So, it shouldn't have "suppliers" in the
name.

It's "need suppliers". As in, this is a device that "needs suppliers".
So, no, this is not a list. This is a node in a list. And all "nodes
in a list" are documented as "Hook" in rest of places in this file. So
I think the documentation is correct as is.

Thanks for your review.
