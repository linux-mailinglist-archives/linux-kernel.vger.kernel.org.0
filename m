It's great that you found the root cause!

Thanks for following through even though your workaround was already
merged and everybody (including myself) agreed that a 50 ms delay
isn't a big problem.

Personally I'm not a friend of sprinkling 'random' (aka not well
understood) delays over the code, they often mask an actual problem
and are hard to remove later (since nobody knows for sure that this
won't break *some* platform). Fixing the UART driver might save
others from spending time debugging and avoid workarounds in other
drivers :)
