I do not want to nitpick about words. If I get it properly,
the "id" is not important here. Any "id" is fine as long as
"seq" matches. Reading "id" once is just an optimization.

I do not resist on the change. It was just an idea how to
avoid confusion. I was confused more than once. But I might
be the only one. The more strightforward code looked more
important to me than the optimization.

No, it is a bug. If info is not read and contains garbage then the
following check may pass by chance:

	if (desc->info.seq != seq)
		return -EINVAL;

Then the function would return 0 even when desc_read() returned
desc_miss or desc_reserved.

It is not error prone. If "id" changes then "seq" will not match.

Yes please, "else" is not needed.

Good catch, this check is superfluous.

Minimizing the lines of code was not my primary goal. I was just
confused by the function name. Also the fact that "seq" was the
important thing was well hidden.

PS: I dived into the barriers and got lost. I hope that I will
be able to send something sensible in the end ;-)
