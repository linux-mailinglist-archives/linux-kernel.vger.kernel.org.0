Hi Mel,

just a quick update. I have increased the testing coverage and other
tests from the NAS shows a big performance drop for the low number of
threads as well:

sp_C_x - show still the biggest drop upto 50%
bt_C_x - performance drop upto 40%
ua_C_x - performance drop upto 30%

My point is that the performance drop for the low number of threads is
more common than we have initially thought.

Let me know what you need more data.

Thanks!
Jirka
