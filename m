Yes it could just be a single loop var, but in that case it would have 
to be reset at the start of the second loop, which means we would have 
to pass 'addr' for resetting the loop anyway, so I opted to do it 
outside the inline asm by using to separate loop vars set to their 
starting value outside the inline asm.
