OK, I finally got back to this and confirmed:

1. The above error is actually somewhat harmless.  The eDP failure
will be retried automatically despite the scary message.  Specifically
see the loop in analogix_dp_bridge_enable().  I confirmed that after
seeing the error the screen came up just fine (I looked at the screen
in two actual instances but I believe it's pretty much always fine).

2. I haven't seen any evidence that the eDP link training happens any
more often with this revert in place.  Specifically, I see the same
message in the logs (at what appears to be the same rate) with or
without this revert.

3. Probably the link-training failures here are the same ones we
debugged for PSR for rk3399-gru-kevin that we fixed by making the eDP
PCLK rate exactly 24 MHz.  See <https://crrev.com/c/433393> for
details.  On rk3399-gru-kevin it was super important to resolve the
root cause of these errors because we had PSR (which meant we were
constantly taking to the eDP controller).  On rk3288-veyron devices
with no PSR the retry should be a fine solution and it doesn't seem
like a good idea to fully rejigger our clock plan to fix the root
cause.


NOTE: I saw _one_ case on rk3288-veyron-minnie where the screen looked
wonky at bootup and I saw the eDP link training error in the logs.
That's what originally made me cautious.  I haven't been able to
reproduce this, but presumably I just got super unlucky in that one
case.  I've left devices rebooting all day at work and haven't seen
the wonky screen since then.


Summary: I think this revert is just fine.
