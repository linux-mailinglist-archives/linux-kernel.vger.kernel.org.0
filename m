Sharing between processes can be checked by referenced_ptes,
but, sharing between threads cannot be checked by it. I guess that
VM_EXEC check is for thread case since most of executable is usually
shared by thread. But, from below your comment, I re-consider the
reason of VM_EXEC check. See below.

Sound reasonable.

But, now, I have another thought about it. I think that the root of the rea=
son
of this check is that there are two different reference tracking models
on file LRU. If we assume that all file pages are mapped ones, this special
check isn't needed. If executable pages are accessed more frequently than
others, reference can be found more for them at LRU cycle. No need for this
special check.

However, file pages includes syscall-ed pages and mapped pages, and,
reference tracking models for mapped page has a disadvantage to
one for syscall-ed page. Several references for mapped page would be
considered as one at LRU cycle. I think that this check is to mitigate
this disadvantage, at least, for executable file mapped page.

> IMO this applies to executable file and anon equally.

anon LRU consist of all mapped pages, so, IMHO,  there is no need for
special handling for executable pages on anon LRU. Although reference
is just checked at LRU cycle, it would correctly approximate reference
frequency.

Moreover, there is one comment in shrink_active_list() that explains one
reason about omission of this check for anon pages.

"Anon pages are not likely to be evicted by use-once streaming IO, plus JVM
can create lots of anon VM_EXEC pages, so we ignore them here."

Lastly, as I said before, at least, it is done separately with appropriate
investigation.

You're right. I will fix it.

Now, I plan to make a next version applied all your comments except
VM_EXEC case. As I said above, fundamental difference between
file mapped page and anon mapped page is that file LRU where file mapped
pages are managed uses two reference tracking model but anon LRU uses
just one. File LRU needs some heuristic to adjust the difference of two mod=
els,
but, anon LRU doesn't need at all. And, I think VM_EXEC check is for this c=
ase.

Please let me know your opinion about VM_EXEC case. I will start to rework
if you agree with my thought.

Anyway, all comments are very helpful to me. Really, thanks Johannes.

Thanks.
