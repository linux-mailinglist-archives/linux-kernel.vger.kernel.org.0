If it is, that means it's *cold* so it's really worth to be reclaimed.

Yeb, that's undesirable. I should admit it was not intended when I implemented
PAGEOUT. The thing is page_check_references clears access bit of pte for every
process are sharing the page so that two times MADV_PAGEOUT from a process could
evict the page. That's the really bug. It shouldn't have cleared the
access bit for other processes. What I wanted to do with MADV_PAGEOUT is just
check the reference from the other processes without clearing access bit of pte
and if it found other process pte has access bit, just bail out.

Okay so you're right. Current implementation could cause performance impact
since MADV_PAGEOUT unconditionally clear the access bit of other processes so
your patch will fix it.

Thanks.
