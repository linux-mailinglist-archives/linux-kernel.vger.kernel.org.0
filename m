There's a cautious tale of the old crappy RAID5 XOR assembler functions which
were optimized a long time ago for the Pentium1, and stayed around,
even though the compiler could actually do a better job.

String instructions are constantly improving in performance (Broadwell is
very old at this point) Most likely over time (and maybe even today
on newer CPUs) you would need much more sophisticated unrolled MOVNTI variants
(or maybe even AVX-*) to be competitive.

The best clear functions may also be different for different CPU
generations.

Using the string instructions has the advantage that all of this is abstracted
from the kernel.
