Oh very nice; yes, thank you. This is all very out of date. Notes

IIUC, the :c:func:`...()` marking isn't needed any more, just having a

Some of these are going away in favor of the "blobs" member of struct
lsm_info. Casey might have more to say on the plans here.

Casey, what do you think of the wording here? It's certainly better than
before, but maybe it should be further improved?

All my comments are basically nit-picks. :) This patch is already a nice
improvement over what's already there. Thanks!
