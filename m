The -1 makes order is int, which breaks the consistency of the type of order.

Since this check is done by is_via_compact_memory(), it is easy to modify the
special value being checked.

I have checked every check many times and now I need some reviews from
the community.

At first glance it seems that this series of patches is large. But at least
half of it is to modify the corresponding trace function. And you can see
that except patch 4 and patch 5, other patches only modify the type of
order.

Even for patch 5 with function modifications, the modified code has only
about 50 lines.

This is just clean up. And others have done similar work before.

commit d00181b96eb8 ("mm: use 'unsigned int' for page order")
commit 7aeb09f9104b ("mm: page_alloc: use unsigned int for order in
more places")

But this choice breaks the consistency of the order type, isn't it?

Because the check is done in is_via_compact_memory() , you don't need to
worry too much about the modification.

As I mentioned earlier, maintaining the consistency of the order type.

Do you really like to see such a call stack?

__alloc_pages_slowpath(unsigned int order, ...)
/* The type has changed! */
  => should_compact_retry(int order, ...)
    => compaction_zonelist_suitable(int order, ...)
      => __compaction_suitable(int order, ...)
/* The type has changed again! */
         => zone_watermark_ok(unsigned int order, ...)

The type of order has changed twice!

According to commit d00181b96eb8 and commit 7aeb09f9104b, we
want the order type to be the same.

There are currently only five functions in page_alloc.c that use int
order, and three of them are related to compaction.

My summary,

1) This is just clean up. And others have done similar work before.
commit d00181b96eb8 ("mm: use 'unsigned int' for page order")
commit 7aeb09f9104b ("mm: page_alloc: use unsigned int for order in
more places")

2) Thanks to is_via_compact_memory(), it is easy to modify the
special value -1 to another value.

3) Not much modification.
Function code modified about 50 lines, and only in patch 4 and patch 5.
At least half of it is to modify the corresponding trace function
