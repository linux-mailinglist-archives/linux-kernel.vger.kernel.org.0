After more digging, I'm convinced there is a RTS glitch in the uart driver.

To be clear, after porting the cheza pin configuration, I don't see
any frame reassembly errors.  With the updated pinconfig, the
remaining questions would be why is the 50 ms delay necessary to
receive the event, and why does the event come when flow is disabled?

I investigated the possibility of a RTS issue.  After studying the
uart hardware documentation, I concluded that the driver was doing the
wrong thing as part of "reset".  Instead of de-asserting RTS, it was
asserting it, thus enabling flow.  Disabling flow would asset RTS as
part of the reset from the termios operation, then disable the
hardware flow management as part of a mctrl operation, which would end
up deasserting RTS (although this appear to be a concidence and not
guarenteed by the hardware documentation).  Then the host baud change
would invoke the termios operation, which would reset the hardware and
re-assert RTS, but there would be no mctrl operation to de-assert RTS
again, which is what would be expected.  Thus the wcn3990 would be
free to send the response, which would line up with the data showing
an event received immediately after the host baud change, even though
flow is expected to be disabled at that point.

I still have no logic analyzer, nor a platform that allows me to get
at the actual signals, however I hacked up the pinctrl driver to allow
me to read the raw gpio state at any point from code.  I was able to
use this to confirm that RTS was not behaving as expected, and what
exact operations in the uart driver was causing the errant behavior.

By changing the uart driver to de-assert RTS instead of asserting RTS
as part of "reset", I see that the RTS gpio line behaves as expected,
and the expected event always comes after flow is re-enabled.  This
behavior does not change despite having a 1 second delay after host
baud change, a 50ms delay, or no delay.

Therefore, I believe we have root caused why the 50ms delay was having
an effect, and determined a proper fix.  I will be formulating a
proper patch to the uart driver, and sending it upstream

Marcel, I appreciate that you picked up this change (adding a 50 ms
delay).  However, since I believe we have root caused the issue and
formulated a proper fix, this change is now unnecessary, and I believe
it should be dropped.  How would you like to handle that?  Would you
like me to post a revert?
