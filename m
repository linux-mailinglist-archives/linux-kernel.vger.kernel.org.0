Dear Friend,

I'm sorry but happy to inform you about my success in getting those
funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Vietnam,
though I tried my best to involve you in the business but God decided
the whole situations. Presently I=E2=80=99m in Vietnam for investment proje=
cts
with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I didn't forget your
past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds
despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary in Burkina Faso her name is Ms. Jemilla Smith
on her e-mail address below  jemillasmith10@gmail.com  ask her to send
you the total of $1.1Milion which I kept for your compensation for all
the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I
appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So feel free and get
in touched with my secretary Ms. Jemilla Smith and instruct her where
to send the amount to you. Please do let me know immediately you
receive it so that we can share joy after all the sufferness at that
time.

In the moment, I=E2=80=99m very busy here because of the investment project=
s
which I and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remember that
I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive
that money, so feel free to get in touch with Ms. Jemilla Smith she
will send the amount to you without any delay OK. Extend my greetings
to your family.

My Best regards
Yours brother
Mr. Abu Salam
Greetings from Vietnam
