OK, probably this is impossible, collapse_shmem() does unmap_mapping_pages(),
so handle_pte_fault() will call shmem_fault() which iiuc should block in
find_lock_entry() because new_page is locked, and thus down_write_trylock()
can't succeed.

Nevermind, I am sure I missed something. Perhaps you can update the comments
to make this more clear.

Oleg.
