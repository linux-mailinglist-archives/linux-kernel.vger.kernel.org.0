OK, it would make sense to make the patch minimalist to make it
easier for backporting.

IMHO, v2 creates even more mess in print tests that would need
to be fixed later.

If we agree to have a minimalist patch for backport
then I suggest to take v1. We could clean up and update
tests later.

Rasmus, others, is anyone against this approach (v1 first,
tests later)?
