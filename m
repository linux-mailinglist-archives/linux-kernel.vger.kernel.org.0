Firstly, sorry my patch broke your platform.

I took a closer look. So two different drivers [1] [2] are saying they
know how to handle "arm,vexpress-sysreg" and are expecting to run at
the same time. That seems a bit unusual to me. I wonder if this is a
violation of the device-driver model because this expectation would
never be allowed if these device drivers were actual drivers
registered with driver-core. But that's a discussion for another time.

To fix this issue you are facing, this patch should work:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200324195302.203115-1-saravanak@google.com/T/#u

Can you please test it and give a Tested-by?

Thanks,
Saravana
