Yes, that combination shouldn't cause a deadlock. However, the lockdep
code isn't able to recognize this case and so you may still see splat
about possible deadlock scenario when lockdep checking is enabled. So
the general advise is still to try to rearrange the lock ordering, if
possible.

Lock starvation is certainly possible with the current rwsem code. Why
don't try to apply the patch to see if it can remedy your problem?
