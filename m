Yeah, reading this now, it feels pretty clumsy, and only remotely
connected to the patch.

What I'm trying to say here is that, although GICv4.1 doesn't have
the full spectrum of v4.0 DirectLPI (it only allows a subset of it),
this subset is more then enough for us. Here's the rational:

When a vPE exits from the hypervisor, we know whether we need to
request a doorbell or not (depending on whether we're blocking on
WFI or not). On GICv4.0, this translates into enabling the doorbell
interrupt, which generates an invalidation (costly). And whenever
we've taken a doorbell, or are scheduled again, we need to turn
the doorbell off (invalidation again).

With v4.1, we can just say *at exit time* whether we want doorbells
to be subsequently generated (see its_vpe_4_1_deschedule() and the
req_db parameter in the info structure). This is part of making
the vPE non-resident, so we have 0 overhead at this stage.

I'll try and update the comment here.

Thanks,

         M.
