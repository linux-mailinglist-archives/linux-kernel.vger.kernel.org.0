Hi Linus,

Looks like this breaks booting for droid4 with a cpcap
PMIC, probably as regulators won't work. There's no GPIO
controller involved in this case for the chip select, the
pins are directly controlled by the spi-omap2-mcspi.c
driver.

From the pin muxing setup we see there's a pull-down on
mcspi1_cs0 pin meaning it's active high:

/* 0x4a100138 mcspi1_cs0.mcspi1_cs0 ae23 */
OMAP4_IOPAD(0x138, PIN_INPUT_PULLDOWN | MUX_MODE0)

My guess a similar issue is with similar patches for
all non-gpio spi controllers?

Let me know if you want me to test some other changes,
or if this patch depends on some other changes.

Regards,

Tony
