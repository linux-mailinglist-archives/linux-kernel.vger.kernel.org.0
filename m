This takes about 15s of flickering for b/w/red displays. Since they're bist=
able, they can also only physically refresh part of the area though. The re=
ason for not having that on-by-default is that epaper partial refresh is re=
ally tricky. If you refresh the same area partially a few times, charge bui=
lds up, image quality degrades and the picture starts bleeding. If you refr=
esh the same area partially all the time and don't do enough full refresh c=
ycles to balance charges again, eventually the display is going to get perm=
anent burn-in. I think partial refresh should be supported by a driver like=
 this since it's a good tool to alleviate the enormous full refresh times.

If userspace doesn't update for x hours, kernel forces a refresh. Then, use=
rspace can still manage this if necessary with a full redraw.

In that case I'm suggesting we experiment around a lot first in the
kernel to improve this. The trouble with uapi is it's forever, kernel
driver heuristics can be changed much easier. If you want to have it
easier for experimentation then I think the right uapi is probably
going to be a custom drm_fourcc.h, with one plane containing the
white/black/red values (so 2 bits per pixel), and the 2nd plane
containing all the information for partial update. But that would just
be a patch you're carrying locally for quick development of
heuristics.

For these partial update heuristics I think a good starting point
would be to wire up the damage stuff, and default to full refresh for
full frame updates.

Just throwing this in as an idea.
