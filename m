OK, I can change the names here and try to find a good place to add a comment.

Any way I can convince you to change your mind here?  There are no
functional changes requested so far in your feedback and no bugs--it's
just a few variable names and comments.  By landing the existing
patches as-is:

1. We stop spamming all the people CCed on this whole series (which
includes device tree patches) that might be interested in the series
as a whole but aren't interested in details.

2. We can debate the bikeshed-type issues on their own merit and I
don't have to debate removing existing Acks / Reviewed-by / Tested-by
tags as I make changes.

3. Even if it's not a good time to land the patches right now we know
that these patches will be ready to land as soon as the window opens.
As I mentioned earlier these patches are blocking other work [1] and
landing that patch is actually preventing Matthias from submitting
another series of patches to add support for rk3288-veyron-tiger and
rk3288-veyron-fievel.  Certainly I know that upstream doesn't make a
policy of landing things just to suit the timelines of a downstream
project, but in this case there seems very little downsides to landing
the existing patches and taking a later cleanup patch.

Hope you have had a great vacation!
