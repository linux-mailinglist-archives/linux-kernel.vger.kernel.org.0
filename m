Yeah wow, I missed that once again.  Whoops.

Add a comment for this?  Just before the asm maybe, "we temporarily switch
r1 to a different stack" or something.

It is not.  On ELFv2 it is (or will be) optionally volatile, but like on
ELFv1 it already has special rules as well: the linker is responsible for
restoring it if it is non-volatile, and for that there needs to be a nop
after the bl, etc.

But the existing code was in a similar situation and we survived that, I
think we should be fine this way too.  And it won't be too hard to change
again if needed.

No, that is a quite bad idea: it depends on the stack pointer not being
used in any way between the two asms.  Which this code does not guarantee
(what if it is inlined, for example).

Doing the stack juggling and the actual call in a single asm is much more
safe and correct.  It's just that you then need asm for the actual call
that works for all ABIs you support, etc. :-)
