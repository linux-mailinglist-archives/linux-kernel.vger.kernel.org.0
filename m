Nit, but if you moved idx, might as well remove the unnecessary
initialization of it as well ;-)

It's initialized here.

Hmm, this only checks the one index, which can change and then we miss
everything. I think we can do better. What about this:


        for (idx = 0; idx < task_pri; idx++) {
		int found = -1;

                if (!__cpupri_find(cp, p, lowest_mask, idx))
                        continue;

                if (!lowest_mask || !fitness_fn)
                        return 1;

		/* Make sure we have one fit CPU before clearing */
		for_each_cpu(cpu, lowest_mask) {
			if (fitness_fn(p, cpu)) {
				found = cpu;
				break;
			}
		}

		if (found == -1)
			continue;

                /* Ensure the capacity of the CPUs fit the task */
                for_each_cpu(cpu, lowest_mask) {
                        if (cpu < found || !fitness_fn(p, cpu))
                                cpumask_clear_cpu(cpu, lowest_mask);
                }

                return 1;
        }

This way, if nothing fits we return the untouched lowest_mask, and only
clear the lowest_mask bits if we found a fitness cpu.
