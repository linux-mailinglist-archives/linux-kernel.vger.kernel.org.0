Digital mute does not help too, as they get unmuted before 
sdw_enable_stream() call in trigger, I hit same click sound.

Same in the disable path too!

Also I noticed that there are more than 20+ register read/writes in the 
sdw_enable_stream() path which took atleast 30 to 40 milliseconds.


I will try my luck checking the docs to see if I can find something 
which talks about this.
