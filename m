Hello
   My name Mrs. Ann Johnson from UK,I am a dying woman who had decided to d=
onate what I have left to you. I am 59 years old and was diagnosed of ovari=
an cancer about 2 years ago immediately after the death of my husband, who =
had left me with everything he worked for. I have decided to donate/will =
=C2=A39,500,000.00 pounds to you to help the motherless, less privileged an=
d also for the assistance of the widows ,rather than allow my relatives to =
use my husband hard earned funds ungodly as i will be going in for an opera=
tion do not know if i will survived it. Upon receipt of your positive respo=
nse along with your full contact details will notify my bank to presenting =
you as my next of kin/beneficiary to facilitate the funds disbursement to y=
ou.

God Bless you
Mrs. Ann Johnson
