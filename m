Well that would be racy right? It could be THP when you call
the function, by the time you try to free it, it's already
split up ...


Two more points:

1. we can probably teach QEMU to always use the pbp
machinery - will be helpful to reduce number of madvise calls too.

2. Something we should do is teach balloon to
inflate using address/length pairs instead of PFNs.
This way we can pass a full THP in one go.
