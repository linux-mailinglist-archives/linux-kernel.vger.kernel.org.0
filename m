Linux CPU scheduling tail latency is a well-known issue and a major
pain point in some workloads:
https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+cpu+scheduling+tail+latency

Even assuming that nobody noticed this particular cause
of CPU scheduling latencies, it does not mean the problem should be waved
away. At least it should be documented, if at this point it decided that
it is difficult to address it in a meaningful way. And, preferably, a way
to address the issue later on should be discussed and hopefully agreed to.
