I never liked the qcom,tcs-offset property. Why can't that be hardcoded
in the driver based on the compatible string? Why does it need to be
specified in DT at all?

This one too. Is the idea that some boards are going to change how the TCS
FIFOs are used?

I suspect an ascii block diagram would be useful to understand how it is
all done up. But given that the first TCS block has some sort of irq
control registers maybe it isn't correct to draw it split out of TCS0. I
think the first TCS is always the "active" TCS so it has these registers
for "irq control". The other two are the sleep and wake ones. But
sometimes there isn't an active TCS or software doesn't have a use for
it? Can probably indicate this in the diagram too.

Oh and maybe there should be CMD registers inside each TCS in this
diagram. It'd be great to have something like this so visual learners
like me can understand it all.
