Dear Greg. I wrote a blog to explain the intention of WarpDrive here:
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/79680889.

Sharing data is not our intention, Sharing address is. NOIOMMU mode is just a
temporary solution to let some hardware which does not care the security issue
to try WarpDrive for the first step. Some user do not care this much in embedded
scenario. We saw VFIO use the same model so we also want to make a try. If you
insist this is risky, we can remove it.

Thanks.
