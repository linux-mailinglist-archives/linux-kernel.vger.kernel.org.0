Please enlighten me by providing some details on what the CPU could do to
this word-aligned, word-sized variable in the absence of lock and barrier
that is relevant to this specific use-case ?

I suspect most of the barriers you refer to here are taken care of by the
tracepoint code which uses RCU to synchronize probe registration wrt
probe callback execution.

No, that's not my intent to add overhead to guarantee trace data
availability near trace beginning and end. However, considering that
READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() can provide additional data availability
guarantees in the middle of traces at no runtime cost, it seems like a
good trade off.

It's easier for an analysis to disregard missing information at the
beginning and end of trace without generating false-positive reports
than when it happens spuriously in the middle of traces.

Indeed the tracepoint use of RCU to synchronize registration vs probes
should take care of those barriers.

I just sent that fix in a separate patch.

I'm not convinced by your arguments.
