That sounds about right, assuming that would also prevent those from
showing up in available_filter_functions, etc.

Another option would be to have arm64's ftrace_adjust_addr() detect this
case and return NULL, given we don't need to perform any call site
initialization for the redundant NOPs. I'm just not sure if we have all
the necessary information at that point, though.

Thanks,
Mark.
