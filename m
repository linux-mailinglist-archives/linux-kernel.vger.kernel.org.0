The man is no[w] a eunich is what I ment to type. I did type it later in 
the post. My definition is the anti-american definition.

Men are men. Women are women. Women who cannot have children are broken 
women. Men with their genitals sawn off (with proof posted to their own 
website) are Euniches.

(And you shouldn't marry ANY of them: only marry young virgin girls.)

Remember: RMS was "cancled" for TEXT he posted to /his own/ website, and 
people here felt it "on topic" to demand his removal.
