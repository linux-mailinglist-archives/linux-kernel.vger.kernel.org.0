Subject: [PATCH POC] printk_ringbuffer: Alternative implementation of lockless printk ringbuffer
Date:   Thu,  4 Jul 2019 12:33:21 +0200

This is POC that implements the lockless printk ringbuffer slightly
different way. I believe that it is worth considering because it looks
much easier to deal with. The reasons are:

	+ The state of each entry is always clear.

	+ The write access rights and validity of the data
	  are clear from the state of the entry.

	+ It seems that three barriers are enough to synchronize
	  readers vs. writers. The rest is done implicitely
	  using atomic operations.

Of course, I might have missed some critical race that can't get
solved by the new design easily. But I do not see it at the moment.

The code compiles but it is not really tested. I wanted to send it
ASAP in a good enough state before we spend more time on cleaning
up either of the proposals.

How it works:

It uses two buffers (data, descriptors) like in John's variant.
The main difference is how the state is handled.

The trick is in the descriptor state "dst" variable included
in struct prb_desc. It consists of 3 values that are manipulated
atomically:

   + sequence number
   + committed flag
   + reuse flag

All the operations rely on the fact that we know what sequence
number we are looking for. From this point of view the descriptor
can be in the following states, see also enum prb_desc_state
and prb_desc_state() function:

   + miss: sequence number is not the expected one
   + reserved: sequence matches, both flags cleared
   + committed: sequence matches, committed flag set
   + reusable: sequence matches, both flags set

Next, the descriptor and data array are crosslinked:

   + descriptor contains: lpos, lpos_next
   + data array contains: seq

The main trickery is in prb_read_desc(). It reads descriptor
for the given sequence number into a buffer. It returns
enum prb_desc_state that says how much the values are valid.
The meaning is the following, by descriptor state:

   + miss: nothing is valid
   + reserved: nothing is valid
   + committed: everything is valid (descriptor, data)
   + reusable: descriptor has valid lpos, lpos_next but
	data are not longer valid

The validity is guaranteed by double checking the descriptor
state before and after reading the other values. It might
be less efficient than Jonh's approach. But I find it much
easier to make sure that the consistency more is correct.

Consistency:

1. Writer become owner of the descriptor by pushing rb->seq_newest
   forward. From this point, it has exclusive write access to
   the descriptor until the committed flag is set.

   The descriptor that is being replaced has to be in reusable
   state and the related data are not longer in valid lpos_oldest,
   lpos_latest range. By other words, nobody need the data from
   the old descriptor any longer.

   The descriptor can be moved into reusable state only
   when it was in the committed state before (atomic operation).

2. Writer reserve data by pushing rb->lpos_newest. From this
   point, it has exclusive access to the data until committed
   flag is set.

   Writers have to make enough space for the data before they
   change lpos_newest by pushing rb->lpos_oldest. They use
   the crosslinked "seq" to find the right descriptors and
   set them reusable.

   Again, only committed descriptors can be marked reusable.

3. Writers set committed flag when everything is set correctly.
   It means that crosslink and data are set correctly.

   From this point, they must not modify the descriptor or
   the data any longer. They might get moved into the reusable
   state at any time.

4. Readers have a simple life. They just try to access descriptors
   in the seq_oldest, seq_newest range. They try to read data
   only when the descriptor is in the committed state. They
   double check the state after the data read (copied).

5. Finally, I believe that we do not need to be concerned about
   overflows of seq or lpos numbers. All operations are done
   with interrupts disabled. Therefore they can be interrupted
   only by NMI. And NMI could not reserve and already
   reserved descriptor before it gets committed.

   By other words, I do not see a way how any CPU could
   rotate lpos or seq numbers over the entire range while
   while another CPU is still looking for a reusable
   descriptor/data.

TODO when there is interest in this variant:

     + add printk_ringbuffer.h and Makefile
     + solve bootstrap (first added message)
     + add iterators
     + fix bugs (one-off and other ungly mistakes)
