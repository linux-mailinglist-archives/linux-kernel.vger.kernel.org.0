Ack. The unholy mess of cpu hotplug notifiers and the at least 50 bugs
which were unearthed by converting them to a comprehensible and
symmetric state machine have documented the insanity of notifiers
nicely.

Right. The amount of possible handlers is really not huge.

So having a well defined flow of explicit calls including the handling
of magic workarounds in a central place makes tons of sense.
