But this implies that there is an actual need to hold these locks
exclusively. Given that they are (except for the raw case) all wrapped
by Linux locking primitives there shouldn't be a problem sharing a lock
(except possibly for the raw case).


I agree that we shouldn't specify this property in DT - if anything it
should be a variant of the API.

Why would the driver need to know about it?

Afaict if the lock are shared then there shouldn't be a problem with
some clients using the request API and others request_specific(). As any
collisions would simply mean that there are more contention on the lock.

With the current exclusive model that is not possible and the success of
the request_specific will depend on probe order.

But perhaps it should be explicitly prohibited to use both APIs on the
same hwspinlock instance?
