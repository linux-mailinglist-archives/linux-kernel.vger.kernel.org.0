Sure, we like the new time-scaling PELT which ramps up faster and, as
long as we have idle time, it's better in predicting what would be the
utilization as if we was running at max OPP.

However, the experiment above shows that:

 - despite the task being a 75% after a certain activation, it takes
   multiple activations for PELT to actually enter that range.

 - the first activation ends at 665, 10% short wrt the configured
   utilization

 - while the PELT signal converge toward the 75%, we have some pretty
   consistent drops at wakeup time, especially after the first big
   activation.

> Or am I missing something?

I'm not sure the above happens because of a problem in the new
time-scaling PELT, I actually think it's kind of expected given the
way we re-scale time contributions depending on the current OPPs.

It's just that a 375 drops in utilization with just 1.1ms sleep time
looks to me more related to the time-scaling invariance then just the
normal/expected PELT decay.

   Could it be an out-of-sync issue between the PELT time scaling code
   and capacity scaling code?
   Perhaps due to some OPP changes/notification going wrong?

Sorry for not being much more useful on that, maybe Vincent has some
better ideas.

The only thing I've kind of convinced myself is that an EWMA on
util_est does not make a lot of sense for increasing utilization
tracking.

Best,
Patrick
