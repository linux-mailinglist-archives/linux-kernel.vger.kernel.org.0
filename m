No, I meant the 'assign init_dyn_addr even if !SA', and the code I
pointed in my other reply tends to confirm that this is something we
already take into account (maybe not correctly, but the code is here).

Right, you shouldn't reserve a slot when ->static_address == 0 &&
->dynamic_address == 0, but I still don't see where the problem is with
the solution we have right now, sorry. Note that even if you reserve a
slot in that case, the device only occupies 2 slots for a short amount
of time, because the add_i3c_dev() logic will detect that the descriptor
already exists and reattach the device with its new address.

Can you please try the approach I suggest? => fix the existing logic to
make it work without this "free undiscovered dev desc, reallocate later"
dance.
