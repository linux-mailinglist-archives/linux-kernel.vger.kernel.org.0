You are not mistaken, and this issue has been known for a long time for
busses such as PCI, where writes are "posted" - they can be delayed by
any PCI bridge.  The PCI ordering rules state that a MMIO write must
complete before a MMIO read is allowed, so the way drivers work around
this problem is to use a write-readback sequence where its important
that the write must hit the device in a timely manner.

If anything, MSI is even worse - for example, if you disable the
interrupt at a device by writing and then reading back, an interrupt
could be "in flight" via the MSI mechanism just before the write hits,
but the CPU receives the interrupt after the read-back.

Note that the race condition the wikipedia article talks about is
between the device DMAing _to_ memory and the device sending a MSI.
It is not about the CPU writing to the device and the device sending
a MSI.

However, there is another aspect to consider - in a SMP system, the
interrupt could be processed by another CPU, so merely relying on
writing a peripheral register to stop an interrupt may mean that the
interrupt handler is already executing on some other CPU.
synchronize_irq() helps to avoid that.  Note that it doesn't help with
the MSI issue.
