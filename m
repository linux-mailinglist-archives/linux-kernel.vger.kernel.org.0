Rename the ia64 documentation files to ReST, add an
index for them and adjust in order to produce a nice html
output via the Sphinx build system.

There are two upper case file names. Rename them to
lower case, as we're working to avoid upper case file
names at Documentation.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

 One of the reasons for doing it this way is to allow for EFI to still evolve

 enables flexibility and permits writing wrapper code is ncase things change.

-III/ Time of day service

+3. Time of day service
+======================
 
 The part of the driver gives access to the time of day service of EFI.
 Two ioctl()s, compatible with the legacy RTC calls:
 
-	Read the CMOS clock: ioctl(d, RTC_RD_TIME, &rtc);
+	Read the CMOS clock::
 
-	Write the CMOS clock: ioctl(d, RTC_SET_TIME, &rtc);
+		ioctl(d, RTC_RD_TIME, &rtc);
+
+	Write the CMOS clock::
+
+		ioctl(d, RTC_SET_TIME, &rtc);
 
 The rtc is a pointer to a data structure defined in rtc.h which is close
-to a struct tm:
+to a struct tm::
 
-struct rtc_time {
-        int tm_sec;
-        int tm_min;
-        int tm_hour;
-        int tm_mday;
-        int tm_mon;
-        int tm_year;
-        int tm_wday;
-        int tm_yday;
-        int tm_isdst;
-};
+  struct rtc_time {
+          int tm_sec;
+          int tm_min;
+          int tm_hour;
+          int tm_mday;
+          int tm_mon;

+          int tm_wday;
+          int tm_yday;
+          int tm_isdst;
+  };
 
 The driver takes care of converting back an forth between the EFI time and
 this format.
 
 Those two ioctl()s can be exercised with the hwclock command:

-# /sbin/hwclock --show

-IV/ Wakeup Alarm service

+=======================
 
 EFI provides an API by which one can program when a machine should wakeup,
 i.e. reboot. This is very different from the alarm provided by the legacy
 RTC which is some kind of interval timer alarm. For this reason we don't use
 the same ioctl()s to get access to the service. Instead we have

+	Read the current state of the alarm::
 
-	Set the alarm or change its status

-	
-struct rtc_wkalrm {
+	Set the alarm or change its status::
 
-        unsigned char enabled; /* =1 if alarm is enabled */
-        unsigned char pending; /* =1 if alarm is pending  */
+		ioctl(d, RTC_WKALM_SET, &wkt)
 
-        struct rtc_time time;

+          unsigned char pending; /* =1 if alarm is pending  */
+
+          struct rtc_time time;
+  }

 the gate page.  It is a proper ELF shared object so, with a dynamic

+Recipe for getting/building/running Xen/ia64 with pv_ops
+********************************************************
+This recipe describes how to get xen-ia64 source and build it,
+and run domU with pv_ops.
+
+Requirements
+============
+
+  - python
+  - mercurial
+    it (aka "hg") is an open-source source code
+    management software. See the below.
+    http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/
+  - git
+  - bridge-utils
+
+Getting and Building Xen and Dom0
+=================================
+
+  My environment is:
+
+    - Machine  : Tiger4
+    - Domain0 OS  : RHEL5
+    - DomainU OS  : RHEL5
+
+ 1. Download source::
+
+	# hg clone http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/ia64/xen-unstable.hg
+	# cd xen-unstable.hg
+	# hg clone http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/ia64/linux-2.6.18-xen.hg
+
+ 2. # make world
+
+ 3. # make install-tools
+
+ 4. copy kernels and xen::
+
+	# cp xen/xen.gz /boot/efi/efi/redhat/
+	# cp build-linux-2.6.18-xen_ia64/vmlinux.gz \
+	/boot/efi/efi/redhat/vmlinuz-2.6.18.8-xen
+
+ 5. make initrd for Dom0/DomU::
+
+	# make -C linux-2.6.18-xen.hg ARCH=ia64 modules_install \
+          O=$(pwd)/build-linux-2.6.18-xen_ia64
+	# mkinitrd -f /boot/efi/efi/redhat/initrd-2.6.18.8-xen.img \
+	  2.6.18.8-xen --builtin mptspi --builtin mptbase \
+	  --builtin mptscsih --builtin uhci-hcd --builtin ohci-hcd \
+	  --builtin ehci-hcd
+
+Making a disk image for guest OS
+================================
+
+ 1. make file::
+
+      # dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/rhel5.img bs=1M seek=4096 count=0
+      # mke2fs -F -j /root/rhel5.img
+      # mount -o loop /root/rhel5.img /mnt
+      # cp -ax /{dev,var,etc,usr,bin,sbin,lib} /mnt
+      # mkdir /mnt/{root,proc,sys,home,tmp}
+
+      Note: You may miss some device files. If so, please create them
+      with mknod. Or you can use tar instead of cp.
+
+ 2. modify DomU's fstab::
+
+      # vi /mnt/etc/fstab
+         /dev/xvda1  /            ext3    defaults        1 1
+         none        /dev/pts     devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0
+         none        /dev/shm     tmpfs   defaults        0 0
+         none        /proc        proc    defaults        0 0
+         none        /sys         sysfs   defaults        0 0
+
+ 3. modify inittab
+
+    set runlevel to 3 to avoid X trying to start::
+
+      # vi /mnt/etc/inittab
+         id:3:initdefault:
+
+    Start a getty on the hvc0 console::
+
+       X0:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty hvc0
+
+    tty1-6 mingetty can be commented out
+
+ 4. add hvc0 into /etc/securetty::
+
+      # vi /mnt/etc/securetty (add hvc0)
+
+ 5. umount::
+
+      # umount /mnt
+
+FYI, virt-manager can also make a disk image for guest OS.
+It's GUI tools and easy to make it.
+
+Boot Xen & Domain0
+==================
+
+ 1. replace elilo
+    elilo of RHEL5 can boot Xen and Dom0.
+    If you use old elilo (e.g RHEL4), please download from the below
+    http://elilo.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/blosxom
+    and copy into /boot/efi/efi/redhat/::
+
+      # cp elilo-3.6-ia64.efi /boot/efi/efi/redhat/elilo.efi
+
+ 2. modify elilo.conf (like the below)::
+
+      # vi /boot/efi/efi/redhat/elilo.conf
+      prompt
+      timeout=20
+      default=xen
+      relocatable
+
+      image=vmlinuz-2.6.18.8-xen
+             label=xen
+             vmm=xen.gz
+             initrd=initrd-2.6.18.8-xen.img
+             read-only
+             append=" -- rhgb root=/dev/sda2"
+
+The append options before "--" are for xen hypervisor,
+the options after "--" are for dom0.
+
+FYI, your machine may need console options like
+"com1=19200,8n1 console=vga,com1". For example,
+append="com1=19200,8n1 console=vga,com1 -- rhgb console=tty0 \
+console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda2"
+
+Getting and Building domU with pv_ops
+=====================================
+
+ 1. get pv_ops tree::
+
+      # git clone http://people.valinux.co.jp/~yamahata/xen-ia64/linux-2.6-xen-ia64.git/
+
+ 2. git branch (if necessary)::
+
+      # cd linux-2.6-xen-ia64/
+      # git checkout -b your_branch origin/xen-ia64-domu-minimal-2008may19
+
+   Note:
+     The current branch is xen-ia64-domu-minimal-2008may19.
+     But you would find the new branch. You can see with
+     "git branch -r" to get the branch lists.

-       Recipe for getting/building/running Xen/ia64 with pv_ops
-       --------------------------------------------------------
-
-This recipe describes how to get xen-ia64 source and build it,
-and run domU with pv_ops.
-
-============
-Requirements
-============
-
-  - python
-  - mercurial
-    it (aka "hg") is an open-source source code
-    management software. See the below.
-    http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/
-  - git
-  - bridge-utils
-
-=================================
-Getting and Building Xen and Dom0
-=================================
-
-  My environment is;
-    Machine  : Tiger4
-    Domain0 OS  : RHEL5
-    DomainU OS  : RHEL5
-
- 1. Download source
-    # hg clone http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/ia64/xen-unstable.hg
-    # cd xen-unstable.hg
-    # hg clone http://xenbits.xensource.com/ext/ia64/linux-2.6.18-xen.hg
-
- 2. # make world
-
- 3. # make install-tools
-
- 4. copy kernels and xen
-    # cp xen/xen.gz /boot/efi/efi/redhat/
-    # cp build-linux-2.6.18-xen_ia64/vmlinux.gz \
-      /boot/efi/efi/redhat/vmlinuz-2.6.18.8-xen
-
- 5. make initrd for Dom0/DomU
-    # make -C linux-2.6.18-xen.hg ARCH=ia64 modules_install \
-      O=$(pwd)/build-linux-2.6.18-xen_ia64
-    # mkinitrd -f /boot/efi/efi/redhat/initrd-2.6.18.8-xen.img \
-      2.6.18.8-xen --builtin mptspi --builtin mptbase \
-      --builtin mptscsih --builtin uhci-hcd --builtin ohci-hcd \
-      --builtin ehci-hcd
-
-================================
-Making a disk image for guest OS
-================================
-
- 1. make file
-    # dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/rhel5.img bs=1M seek=4096 count=0
-    # mke2fs -F -j /root/rhel5.img
-    # mount -o loop /root/rhel5.img /mnt
-    # cp -ax /{dev,var,etc,usr,bin,sbin,lib} /mnt
-    # mkdir /mnt/{root,proc,sys,home,tmp}
-
-    Note: You may miss some device files. If so, please create them
-    with mknod. Or you can use tar instead of cp.
-
- 2. modify DomU's fstab
-    # vi /mnt/etc/fstab
-       /dev/xvda1  /            ext3    defaults        1 1
-       none        /dev/pts     devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0
-       none        /dev/shm     tmpfs   defaults        0 0
-       none        /proc        proc    defaults        0 0
-       none        /sys         sysfs   defaults        0 0
-
- 3. modify inittab
-    set runlevel to 3 to avoid X trying to start
-    # vi /mnt/etc/inittab
-       id:3:initdefault:
-    Start a getty on the hvc0 console
-       X0:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty hvc0
-    tty1-6 mingetty can be commented out
-
- 4. add hvc0 into /etc/securetty
-    # vi /mnt/etc/securetty (add hvc0)
-
- 5. umount
-    # umount /mnt
-
-FYI, virt-manager can also make a disk image for guest OS.
-It's GUI tools and easy to make it.
-
-==================
-Boot Xen & Domain0
-==================
-
- 1. replace elilo
-    elilo of RHEL5 can boot Xen and Dom0.
-    If you use old elilo (e.g RHEL4), please download from the below
-    http://elilo.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/blosxom
-    and copy into /boot/efi/efi/redhat/
-    # cp elilo-3.6-ia64.efi /boot/efi/efi/redhat/elilo.efi
-
- 2. modify elilo.conf (like the below)
-    # vi /boot/efi/efi/redhat/elilo.conf
-     prompt
-     timeout=20
-     default=xen
-     relocatable
-
-     image=vmlinuz-2.6.18.8-xen
-             label=xen
-             vmm=xen.gz
-             initrd=initrd-2.6.18.8-xen.img
-             read-only
-             append=" -- rhgb root=/dev/sda2"
-
-The append options before "--" are for xen hypervisor,
-the options after "--" are for dom0.
-
-FYI, your machine may need console options like
-"com1=19200,8n1 console=vga,com1". For example,
-append="com1=19200,8n1 console=vga,com1 -- rhgb console=tty0 \
-console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda2"
-
-=====================================
-Getting and Building domU with pv_ops
-=====================================
-
- 1. get pv_ops tree
-    # git clone http://people.valinux.co.jp/~yamahata/xen-ia64/linux-2.6-xen-ia64.git/
-
- 2. git branch (if necessary)
-    # cd linux-2.6-xen-ia64/
-    # git checkout -b your_branch origin/xen-ia64-domu-minimal-2008may19
-    (Note: The current branch is xen-ia64-domu-minimal-2008may19.
-    But you would find the new branch. You can see with
-    "git branch -r" to get the branch lists.
-    http://people.valinux.co.jp/~yamahata/xen-ia64/for_eagl/linux-2.6-ia64-pv-ops.git/
-    is also available. The tree is based on
-    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aegl/linux-2.6 test)
-
-
- 3. copy .config for pv_ops of domU
-    # cp arch/ia64/configs/xen_domu_wip_defconfig .config
-
- 4. make kernel with pv_ops
-    # make oldconfig
-    # make
-
- 5. install the kernel and initrd
-    # cp vmlinux.gz /boot/efi/efi/redhat/vmlinuz-2.6-pv_ops-xenU
-    # make modules_install
-    # mkinitrd -f /boot/efi/efi/redhat/initrd-2.6-pv_ops-xenU.img \
-      2.6.26-rc3xen-ia64-08941-g1b12161 --builtin mptspi \
-      --builtin mptbase --builtin mptscsih --builtin uhci-hcd \
-      --builtin ohci-hcd --builtin ehci-hcd
-
-========================
-Boot DomainU with pv_ops
-========================
-
- 1. make config of DomU
-   # vi /etc/xen/rhel5
-     kernel = "/boot/efi/efi/redhat/vmlinuz-2.6-pv_ops-xenU"
-     ramdisk = "/boot/efi/efi/redhat/initrd-2.6-pv_ops-xenU.img"
-     vcpus = 1
-     memory = 512
-     name = "rhel5"
-     disk = [ 'file:/root/rhel5.img,xvda1,w' ]
-     root = "/dev/xvda1 ro"
-     extra= "rhgb console=hvc0"
-
- 2. After boot xen and dom0, start xend
-   # /etc/init.d/xend start
-   ( In the debugging case, # XEND_DEBUG=1 xend trace_start )
-
- 3. start domU
-   # xm create -c rhel5
