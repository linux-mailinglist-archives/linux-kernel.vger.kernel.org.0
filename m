Not only during "sleep" but PDC (and GIC) have a role during "active" time as well.
so we can not just enabled at PDC and GIC when entering to suspend, interrupt need
to keep interrupt enabled at PDC and GIC HW when out of suspend as well.

Okay, since test_bit() is also atomic so i will keep locking inside pc_enable_intr() as it is.

As PDC (and GIC) have a role during "active" time as well, interrupt should be
enabled in PDC and GIC HW.

okay, since set_bit(), clear_bit(), test_bit() are atomic, i will address this to keep
locking inside pdc_enable_intr() only.

.irq_set_wake is testing both "enabled" and "wake" bitmask and then invoking respective parent API.
IMO, This is simpler to keep PDC functionality separate in pdc_enable_intr() and not mix it with invoking parent APIs.
