The change is fairly trivial in the upstream kernel. It requires no
testing in the upstream kernel. It would be great if you could test it
on John's git tree with the implemented gup tracking subsystem and check
if gup tracking is working alright with your dma driver. I think this
patch will easily apply to John's git tree.
