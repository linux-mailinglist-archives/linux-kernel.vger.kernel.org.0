+1 to killing it, since there has been a paucity of 'unsigned long
pfn' code path conversions to 'pfn_t', and it continues to go unused.

Not sure this can be solved without a rethink of who owns the virtual
address space corresponding to MEMORY_DEVICE_PRIVATE, and clawing back
some of the special-ness of HMM.

MEMORY_DEVICE_PRIVATE semantics were part of the package of the
initial HMM submission that landed in the kernel without an upstream
user. While pfn_t_to_virt() also does not have an upstream user it was
at least modeled after the existing pfn_to_virt() api to allow for
future 'unsigned long pfn' to 'pfn_t' conversions. As for what a fix
might look like, it seems to me that we should try to unify 'pfn_t'
and 'hmm_pfn's. I don't see why 'hmm_pfn's need to exist as their own
concept vs trying consume more flag space out of pfn_t. That would at
least allow the pfn_t_has_page() helper to detect the HMM case.
