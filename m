You have two bank switches, one to stop streaming and on in de-prepare. 
It's symmetrical with the start sequence, where we do a bank switch to 
prepare and another to enable.

Let's assume we are using bank0 when streaming.

Before the first bank switch, the channel_enable is set to false in the 
alternate bank1. When the bank switch happens, bank1 become active and 
the streaming stops. But bank0 registers have not been modified so when 
we do the second bank switch in de-prepare we make bank0 active, and the 
ch_enable bits are still set so streaming will restart... When we stop 
streaming, we need to make sure the ch_enable bits are cleared in the 
two banks.
