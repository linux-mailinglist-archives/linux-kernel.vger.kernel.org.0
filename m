[  158.220482] usb usb2: runtime PM trying to activate child device usb2 but parent (7ffb0000.ohci) is not active

suggest there is a bug in the platform code.  The 7ffb0000.ohci 
platform device should already be resumed and active at this point.

Following that, this is suspicious:

[  158.482995] PM: Cannot find swap device, try swapon -a
[  158.488379] PM: Cannot get swap writer

Since there was never any device attached to the OHCI controller, this
error is not connected to the previous one.  In fact, the swap device
was plugged into the EHCI controller; it was 1-1.1.  But the log
doesn't contain anything about that device being suspended, resumed, or
disconnected.  What happened to it?

And why was usb2 resumed twice in a row with intervening suspend?
