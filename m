This particular issue is solvable:

How about:

new_data = ...;
new_action = ...;
if (new_action == SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW) {
  data = new_data;
  action = new_action;
}

It might also be nice to allow a filter to say "hey, I want to set
this result and I do *not* want compatibility aliases applied", but
I'm not quite sure how to express that.

I don't love this whole concept, but I also don't have a better idea.
