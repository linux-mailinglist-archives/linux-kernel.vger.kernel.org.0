Very good!  And please make the commit log more clear.  ;-)

I am referring to the atomic_inc().

That is a good thing, but you might not be measuring what you think you
are measuring.

Please do!  This can be a bit fiddly, but there is example code in
current rcutorture on -rcu.

Easy!  Do more kmalloc()/kfree_rcu() pairs!  ;-)

Ouch!!!  I hope that goes as well as it possibly can!  And please don't
neglect your relative on RCU's account!!!
