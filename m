The filenames for cifs documentation is not using the same
convention as almost all Kernel documents is using. So,
rename them to a more appropriate name. Then, manually convert
the documentation files for CIFS to ReST.

By doing a manual conversion, we can preserve the original
author's style, while making it to look more like the other
Kernel documents.

Most of the conversion here is trivial. The most complex one was
the README file (which was renamed to usage.rst).

+Usage

 This module supports the SMB3 family of advanced network protocols (as well
 as older dialects, originally called "CIFS" or SMB1).
 
 The CIFS VFS module for Linux supports many advanced network filesystem
 features such as hierarchical DFS like namespace, hardlinks, locking and more.

 Information Foundation.  CIFS and now SMB3 has now become a defacto

-Samba Considerations 
+Samba Considerations
 ====================
+
 Most current servers support SMB2.1 and SMB3 which are more secure,
 but there are useful protocol extensions for the older less secure CIFS
 dialect, so to get the maximum benefit if mounting using the older dialect
 (CIFS/SMB1), we recommend using a server that supports the SNIA CIFS
 Unix Extensions standard (e.g. almost any  version of Samba ie version
 2.2.5 or later) but the CIFS vfs works fine with a wide variety of CIFS servers.
