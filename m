Sorry for confusing.  The original question is NOT about comparing the
reconstruction cost between MADV_FREE anon pages and MADV_FREE file
pages, BUT about comparing the reconstruction cost between MADV_FREE
anon pages and ordinary clean file cache pages.  You can find more
details in conversation between Michal and me.

Got it!  Thanks a lot for your patience and sharing.  That's very
helpful.
