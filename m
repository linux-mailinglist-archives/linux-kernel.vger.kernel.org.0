Circling back to this request, because I just realized that the above is
handled by saving %rsp into %rbp and requiring the enclave and handler
to preserve %rbp at all times.

So the below discussion on making the %rsp adjustment relative is moot,
at least with respect to getting out of __vdso() if the enclave has mucked
with the untrusted stack.

Per above, this is unnecessary when returning to the caller of __vdso().
It would be necessary if the enclave wasn't smart enough to do it's own
stack cleanup, but that seems like a very bizarre contract between the
enclave and its runtime.

The caveat is if %rbx is saved/restored by __vdso().  If we want a
traditional frame pointer, then %rbx would be restored from the stack
before %rsp itself is restored (from %rbp), in which case the exit handler
would need to adjust %rsp using a sequence similar to what you listed
above.

If __vdso() uses a non-standard frame pointer, e.g.

  push %rbp
  push %rbx
  mov  %rsp, %rbp

then %rbx would come off the stack after %rsp is restored from %rbp, i.e.
would be guaranteed to be restored to the pre-EENTER value (unless the
enclave or handler mucks with %rbp).

Anyways, we can discuss how to implement the frame pointer in the context
of the patches, just wanted to point this out here for completeness.
