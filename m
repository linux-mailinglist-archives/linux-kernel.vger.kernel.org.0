Another approach is to create (say) a late_initcall() function that
sets a global variable.  Then have the wait loop wait for that global
variable to be set.  Or use an explicit wait/wakeup scheme, if you wish.

This has the virtue of keeping this (admittedly small) bit of complexit
out of the core kernel.

They are indeed (mostly) independent mechanisms.

This is in contrast to SRCU, where an expedited grace period does what
you expect, causing all grace periods to do less waiting until the
most recent expedited grace period has completed.

Why the difference?

o	Current SRCU uses have relatively few updates, so the decreases
	in batching effectiveness for normal grace periods are less
	troublesome than they would be for RCU.  Shortening RCU grace
	periods would significantly increase per-update overhead, for
	example, and less so for SRCU.

o	RCU uses a much more distributed design, which means that
	expediting an already-started RCU grace period would be more
	challenging than it is for SRCU.  The race conditions between
	an "expedite now!" event and the various changes in state for
	a normal RCU grace period would be challenging.

o	In addition, RCU's more distributed design results in
	higher latencies.  Expedited RCU grace periods simply bypass
	this and get much better latencies.

So, yes, normal and expedited RCU grace periods could be converged, but
it does not seem like a good idea given current requirements.
