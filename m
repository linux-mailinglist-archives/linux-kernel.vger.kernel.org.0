So actually the per vq msix could be done through this. I don't get why=20
you need to introduce MSI_SHARING_MASK which is the charge of driver=20
instead of device. The interrupt rate should have no direct relationship=20
with whether it has been shared or not.

Btw, you introduce mask/unmask without pending, how to deal with the=20
lost interrupt during the masking then?

The ABI is not as straightforward as PCI did. Why not just reuse the PCI=20
layout?

E.g having

queue_sel
queue_msix_vector
msix_config

for configuring map between msi vector and queues/config

Then

vector_sel
address
data
pending
mask
unmask

for configuring msi table?
