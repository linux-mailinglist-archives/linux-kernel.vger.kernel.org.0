We're using mlock mostly to avoid non-deterministic behaviour in cache.
For example some of our applications mlock index structures in databases
to limit count of major faults in worst case.

Surprisingly mlock fixates unwanted effects of non-predictable cache sharing.

So, it seems makes sense to make mlock behaviour simple and completely
deterministic because this isn't cheap operation and needs careful
resource planning.

I've implemented something similar in OpenVZ kernel - "shadow" LRU sets for
abandoned cache which automatically changes ownership at first activation.

I'm thinking about fadvise() or fcntl() for moving cache into current memory cgroup.
This should give enough control to solve all our problems.

Yep, not so big problem, tmpfs generates much more issues in this area.

Mlock requires careful resource planning. Since sharing always been
non-deterministic each user should be ready to take all locked memory.

It's hard to inject direct reclaim into another thread for sure.
All we could do is starting background reclaim in kernel thread.
Doing this in task who calls munlock() is not fair.

At mlock it's possible to force direct claim for memory usage over high limit:
