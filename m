Not really, for hibernation pm_suspend_via_s2idle() evaluates to false so  
the old code path will be taken.

Rafael, what do you think about this?
Including this patch, there are five drivers that use  
pm_suspend_via_{firmware,s2idle}() to differentiate between S2I and S3.
So I think maybe it’s time to introduce a new suspend callback for S2I?

Hibernation should remain the same as stated above.

If Modern Standby or Connected Standby is not supported by servers, I don’t  
think the design documents mean much here.
We probably should check if the platform firmware really supports S2I  
instead.
