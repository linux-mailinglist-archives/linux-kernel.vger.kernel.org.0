I got traces from the ASMedia xHC controller in the TB16 dock.
There are issues with split transactions between the ASMedia host and the 7 port
High speed hub built in to the dock.

host reports a split transaction error for mouse or keyboard full-speed/low-speed
interrupt transactions. Endpoint doesn't recover after resetting it.

Split transaction allows full- and low-speed devices to be attached to high-speed
hubs, and are used only between the host and the HS hub. A transaction translator (TT)
in the HS hub will translate the high-speed split transactions on its upstream port to
low/full speed transactions on the downstream port.

I'll see if there are any xHC parameters driver is setting that trigger these
split transaction errors to trigger more easy.
