I worried whether it could be a bother to send the mail to everyone in the
section, but seems it was an unnecessary worry.  Adding those to recipients.
You can get the original thread of this patchset from
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/20200128085742.14566-1-sjpark@amazon.com/

Seems like you are suggesting to implement the DAMON's core logic as a
subcommand of perf in user space.  Because DAMON's logic inherently require
frequent interaction with privileged features that need to be done inside the
kernel space, I think it will incur frequent context switch and might not
fulfill its performance requirement.

As far as I understand, we normally add a data source in the kernel and
implement sophisticated handlings or visualizations in the perf.  I think DAMON
is a source of a new primitive data (data access pattern).
