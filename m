Thanks so much for like and ack this patchset!

For your suggestion, I had thought about the similar idea before. Maybe 
we can, but we need to process some cases.

Say the first address is 0x1000 and the dummy symbol size is 256. We 
create a new dummy symbol for this address (start address is 0x1000 and 
end address is 0x1100).

If the second address is 0x1010, we can't create a new dummy symbol for 
this address directly. On the contrary, we need to search the dummy 
symbol list by the address first. If the dummy symbol is found then 
reuse this symbol.

This idea is a bit more complicated than current patchset in 
implementation but it can collect the hits for the dummy symbols, that's 
the advantage. The advantage of current patchset is it's very simple. :)

Accept current patchset or rewrite for the new idea, both OK for me. :)

Thanks
Jin Yao
