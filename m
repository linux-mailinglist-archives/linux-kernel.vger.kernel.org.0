So while it's the LNBBCLK1 pin we're referring to, it's the RPMH_CXO_CLK
which has some level of magic involved that we should actually use in
the software.

I don't remember the exact outcome, but presume it would depend on the
implementation details of early user space (e.g. my regression test
suite would not deal with this).

We introduced the xo_board fixed clock to have a parent of gcc, but
given that there is a clock named "XO" and it is not the clock being
connected to gcc, nor is it ticking at the right frequency I think it
should at least have a different name.
