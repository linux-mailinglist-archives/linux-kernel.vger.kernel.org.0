I should've been clearer.  [1] is meant as an example of someone suffering from lru_lock during reclaim.  Wouldn't your series help per-memcg reclaim?

I think numbers from that scenario would help your case.

We see it during DB shutdown when each DB process frees its memory (zap_pte_range -> mark_page_accessed).  But that's a different thing, clearly Not This Series.

Aha.  50% decrease in stdev.
