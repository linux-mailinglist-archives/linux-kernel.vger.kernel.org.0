Sorry to be pedantic, but no. Information about a clocksource is the
name, the type, the frequency, bitwidth etc.

The counter file is not providing information about the
clocksource. It's exposing an accessor to the clocksource itself.

But how much value has this interface beyond the 'hack a driver for a
new clocksource' experience?

To me none, but that might be my personal skewed view.
