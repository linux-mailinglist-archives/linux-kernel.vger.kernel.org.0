Yes, that is fine, what I am saying here is that you are now asking the
community to do this for you.  You said in this thread:

Why are you sending code out that you think might have conflicts before
your lawyers have reviewed it?  That's just screaming for problems in
the future (hint, you distributed something in the previous emails...)

Again, go and get this sorted out before dumping that kind of work on
the community as this is something that you are having to deal with
(i.e. it is self-inflicted).  Don't make others do this for you here in
public.

Otherwise I will probably just purposefully tell you the wrong thing,
and then watch what kind of fun your lawyers will have :)
