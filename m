The "delta" is actually for the internal counters. Sorry for the
confusion.

We set -max_period (0x8000 0000 0001) as initial value of FIXCTR3 for 
counting. But the internal counters probably starts counting from 0.
PERF_METRICS is fraction of internal counters / FIXCTR3.
So PERF_METRICS will never works.
We have to make FIXCTR3 count from 0 as well.
