In case you want to use this branch, I just pushed:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-trace.git

  ftrace/text-poke

That is these 6 patches applied to v5.4-rc2

I'm going to start running them through my tests. I can work on these
directly. And if Ingo wants to pull this into tip, then we can do that,
and apply the other patches on top of them.

Ingo, would that work for you?
