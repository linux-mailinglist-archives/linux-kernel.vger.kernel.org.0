Hi Krzysztof,

Many thanks for your quick answer.

Ok, makes sense, I can do it, but if you don't really care of having the
defconfig sync with the savedefconfig output for the below reasons or others,
that's fine with me.

The reason I send the patch is because I think that, at least on some arm
defconfigs, they try to have the defconfig sync with the savedefconfig output,
the idea is to try to make patching the file easier, but I know this is usually
a pain.

Also makes sense, and I didn't know this. My purpose is only add support for the
options missing for Chromebooks. If patch 2 alone is fine and enough for that
purpose, that works for me, and I can just drop this patch from the series. I
only tried to do the right thing to add new options.

Thanks,
 Enric
