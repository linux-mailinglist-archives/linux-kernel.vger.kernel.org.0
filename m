That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the explicit
'nfc_op.cmnds[0] == NAND_CMD_SEQIN' check, which AFAICT, is wrong, or at
the very least, not future-proof at all.

Let me see if I understand what end_cmd_valid means: it's supposed to
be set when the ADDR cycles are followed by a CMD cycle. You don't need
to check if the first CMD cycle is !SEQIN (AKA start programming a page)
to know that: just go through the flow of instructions in the subop,
and check what's coming just after the ADDR instruction.

Yes, I do. Sorry to say that, but the whole driver is coded with
specific use-cases (read/write page, read param page, etc) in mind,
which is exactly what we were trying to avoid when designing
exec_op(). The goal was to have something that's easily maintainable and
does not break every time one tests a previously untested chip <->
controller combination.

Just because it's been tested does not mean it's ready to be merged,
sorry.

You have the exact number of ADDR cycles to issue in the ADDR
instruction, why do you need to check NAND_ROW_ADDR_3 at all?
