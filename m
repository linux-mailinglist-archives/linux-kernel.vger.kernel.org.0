OK, just check the below though so we are doing reference

I don't think that is consistent with the device model: there is already
a struct device inside struct gpio_device which is what gets
created when the gpio_chip is registered.

The struct device inside struct gpio_device contains a
struct kobject.

The struct kobject contains a struct kref.

This kref is increased and decreased with get_device() and
put_device(). This is why in the gpiolib you have a bunch of
this:
get_device(&gdev->dev);
put_device(&gdev->dev);

This is used when creating any descriptor handle with
[devm_]gpiod_request(), linehandles or lineevents.

So it is already reference counted and there is no need to
introduce another reference counter on gpio_chips.

The reason why gpiochip_remove() right now
enforces removal and only prints a warning if you remove
a gpio_chip with requested GPIOs on it, is historical.

When I created the proper device and char device, the gpiolib
was really just a library (hence the name) not a driver framework.
Thus there was no real reference counting of anything
going on, and it was (as I perceived it) pretty common that misc
platforms just pulled out the GPIO chip underneath the drivers
using the GPIO lines.

If we would just block that, say refuse to perform the .remove
action on the module or platform (boardfile) code implementing
GPIO I was worried that we could cause serious regressions.

But I do not think this is a big problem?

Most drivers these days are using devm_gpiochip_add_data()
and that will not release the gpiochip until exactly this same
kref inside struct device inside gpio_device goes down to
zero.

If we should put effort anywhere I think it should be in
making more drivers use devm_gpiochip_add_data()
even if they are not adding any data, because that will make
sure the gpio_chip is not getting removed as long as there are
active consumers (which includes any kernel-internal
consumers or userspace consumers).

I do not think we need one for the gpiochip.

The other usecase I am somewhat following, but I am still in
a state of confusion on what is the best approach there.
I guess I have to re-read the patch.
