Ok, and thanks a lot for this.

Ok. Yes, as said, I've been trying to follow the thread, but thanks a
lot again for this summary.

As said, I'm about to have numbers for the repo/branch I mentioned.

I was considering whether to also re-run the benchmarking campaign with
some of the patches that floated around within this thread. Now, thanks
to your summary, I have an even clearer picture about which patch does
what, and that is indeed very useful.

I'll see about putting something together. I'm thinking of picking:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/b7a83fcb-5c34-9794-5688-55c52697fd84@linux.int=
el.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190725143344.GD992@aaronlu/

And maybe even (part of):
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190810141556.GA73644@aaronlu/#t

If anyone has ideas or suggestions about whether or not this choice
makes sense, feel free to share. :-)

Also, I only have another week before leaving, so let's see what I
manage to actually run, and then share here, by then.

Thanks and Regards
