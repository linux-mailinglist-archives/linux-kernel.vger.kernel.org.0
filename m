Hi Greg,

Technically, what I'm trying to do is to add an attribute which depends on
the uncore pmu type and BIOS support. New attribute is added to the end of
the attribute groups array. It appears that the events attribute group is
optional for most of the uncore pmus for x86/intel, i.e. events_group = 
NULL.

NULL element in the middle of the attribute groups array "hides" all others
attribute groups which follows that element.

To work around it, embedded NULL elements should be either removed from
the attribute groups array [1] or replaced with empty attribute; see 
implementation above.

If both approaches are incorrect then please advice what would be correct
solution for that case.
