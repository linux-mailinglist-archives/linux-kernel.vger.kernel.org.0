Multiple clusters can be in the same Inner Shareable domain, and Linux
relies on this being the case for systems it supports. It's possible to
build a system where clusters are in distinct Inner Shareable domains,
but Linux does not support using all cores on such a system.

Even with CCI, CCN, CMN, etc, Linux requires that all cores (which it is
told about) are in the same Inner Shareable domain. That is what is
commonly built.

Linux requires that those clusters are in the same Inner Shareable
domain, and that's what people (mostly) build today.

Thanks,
Mark.
