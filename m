If the existing few users that don't already do the explicit mmget
will have to start doing it too, the end result will be exactly the
same that you described in your "cons" (lieftime of the mm will still
be up to who did mmget;use_mm and didn't call unuse_mm;mmput yet).

One reason to prefer adding the mmget to the callers to forget it,
would be to avoid an atomic op in use_mm (for those callers that
didn't forget it), but if anybody is doing use_mm in a fast path that
won't be very fast anyway so I didn't think this was worth the
risk. If that microoptimization in a slow path is the reason we should
add mmget to the callers that forgot it that would be fine with me
although I think it's risky because if already happened once and it
could happen again (and when it happens it only bits a few arches if
used with a few drivers).

On a side note the patch 2/2 should be dropped for now, I'm looking if
we can optimize away TLB-i broadcasts from multithreaded apps too.

Thanks,
Andrea
