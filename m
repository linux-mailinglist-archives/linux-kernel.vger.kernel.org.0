Wait, nope, I believe I am the fool here - _supposedly_ available bw is
supposed to reflect the smallest link rate that occurs in a patch to a branch
device. I think, me and sean paul are looking at this a bit more closely. I
think I might need to do some more playing around with my hubs to make sure
this value is actually what we think it is because unfortunately the spec is
pretty vague on this from what I can tell :(
