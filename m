Right. The problem is that as things stand e.g. for tracepoints you need
to invoke trace_foo_rcuidle() which then does the scru/rcu_irq dance
around the invocation, but then the functions attached need to be fixed
that they are not issuing rcu_read_lock() or such.

While that is halfways doable for tracepoints when you place them, the
whole function entry/exit hooks along with kprobes are even more
interesting because functions can be called from arbitrary contexts...

So to make this sane, you'd need to do:

   if (!rcu_watching()) {
   	....
   } else {
        ....
   }

and the reverse when leaving the thing. So in the worst case you end up
with a gazillion of scru/rcu_irq pairs which really make crap slow.

So we are way better off to have well defined off limit regions and are
careful about them and then switch over ONCE and be done with it.
