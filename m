Thanks for the info.  I took a bit time to look your patch set and
Steven's patch set for dynamic function, though don't completely
understand, but get more sense for the context.

We can support NOP/JMP case as the first step, but later should can
extend to support other transitions.

If I understand correctly, PT decoder needs to read out instructions
from dso and decide the instruction type (NOP or JMP), and finally
generate the accurate code flow.

So PT decoder relies on (cached) DSO for decoding.  As I know, this
might be different from Arm CS, since Arm CS decoder is merely
generate packets and it doesn't need to rely on DSO for decoding.

I think my answer is not very convinced, in case I mislead, loop Mike
to confirm for this.

My purpose is to use PRE event and POST event to update cached DSO,
thus perf tool can read out 'correct' instructions and fill them into
instruction/branch samples.  On the other hand, as mentioned, I don't
aware the instruction read out from DSO will be used for Arm CS decoder;
Arm CS also reads the instructions from DSO, usually it's used to decide
instruction size or decide the sample flags (flags for CALL/RETURN/hw
int, etc...), but it isn't used for decoder.

@Mike, please help confirm for this as well, from Arm CoreSight's
decoder pespective.

Thanks a lot for the info!
