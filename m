There are several problems in this group of drivers as far as lifetime
management is concerned. I explained some of it in the patch 2/2

If vimc module is removed while streaming is active, vimc_exit runs
into NULL pointer dereference error when streaming thread tries to
access and lock graph_mutex in the struct media_device.

The primary reason for this is that:

media_device is embedded in struct vimc_device and when vimc is removed
vimc_device and the embedded media_device goes with it, while the active
stream and vimc_capture continue to access it.

If we chose to keep these drivers as component drivers, media device
needs to stick around until all components stop using it. This is tricky
because there is no tie between these set of drivers. vimc module can
be deleted while others are still active. As vimc gets removed, other
component drivers start wanting to access the media device tree.

This is classic media device lifetime problem which could be solved
easily with the way I solved it with this series. I saw this as a
variation on the same use-case we had with sound and media drivers
sharing the media device.

I have a TODO request from you asking to extend Media Device Allocator
API to generic case and not restrict it to USB devices. My thinking is
that this gives a perfect test case to extend the API to be generic
and use to solve this problem.

Collapsing the drivers into one might be lot more difficult and complex
than solving this problem with Media Device Allocator API. This approach
has an added benefit of extending the API to be generic and not just for
USB.

I looked at this as a good way to add generic API and have a great test
case for it. This patch series fixes the problem for the current vimc
architecture.

thanks,
