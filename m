You will have to do some modifications, as for example in PCIe you can
have a n:1 relationship between SQs and CQs.  And you need to handle
the Create/Delete SQ/CQ commands, but not the fabrics commands.  And
modifying subsystems in Linux is perfectly acceptable, that is how they
improve.

Do you have a pointer to your code?

In Linux there aren't struct pages for physical memory remapped using
ioremap().  But if you want to feed them to the I/O subsystem you have
to use devm_memremap_pages to create a page backing.  Assuming you are
on a RISC-V platform given your affiliation you'll need to ensure your
kernel allows for ZONE_DEVICE pages, which Logan (added to Cc) has been
working on.  I don't remember what the current status is.

I know the pages are costly.  But once you want to feed them through
subsystems that do expect pages you'll have to do that.  And anything
using scatterlists currently does.  A little hack here and there isn't
going to solve that.
