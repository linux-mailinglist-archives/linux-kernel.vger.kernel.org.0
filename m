Yes, you're right. I forgot that.

Yes, but does the volume control work (does PA change the appropriate ALSA 
mixer volume)? Sometimes, it's difficult to see the difference between soft

Just install the latest pulseaudio (latest from repo), alsa-lib and 
alsa-ucm-conf (also from repo). If pulseaudio detects UCM, it has the preference.
