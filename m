Writing a formal todo list is much better encouragement than adding
dead code.  Th latter has a tendency of lingering around forever and
actually hurting people.

randconfig or just a user thinking bigger is better and picking it.

Even if we want to support Sv39 only or Sv39+Sv39 the choice in the
patch doesn't make any sense.  So better do the whole thing when its
ready than doing false "groundwork".
