I haven't saw this in real scenario yet.

What I mean is if there is a bug (maybe in is_alive()) failing us to GC on one
section, when that bug happens in two candidates, there could be the same
condition that GC will run into loop (select A, fail to migrate; select B, fail
to migrate, select A...).

But I guess the benefit of this change is, if FGGC fails to migrate block due to
i_gc_rwsem race, selecting another section and later retrying previous one may
avoid lock race, right?
