I'm fine with that. I like the obvious easy ones as it spares to
duplicate all the same crap all over the place.

Making the nasty ones have:

#define DEFINE_IDTENTRY_$NASTY(exc_name)	\
__visible void notrace exc_name(args....)

would solve this and you can stick whatever you want into it and have
the NOPROBE added manually. Hmm?

Thanks,
