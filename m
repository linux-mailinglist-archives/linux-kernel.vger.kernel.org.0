Actually I was said that using an adverbe was the thing to do, so I've
just fix the typo by adding the missing "i". you don't have to resend
it.

I thought it was documented in the MAINTAINER file but I was wrong, so I
will fix it.

I referred to git://git.infradead.org/linux-mvebu.git

this branch will be merged in our for-next branch when 5.2-rc1 will be
released, so it will be part of linux-next.
