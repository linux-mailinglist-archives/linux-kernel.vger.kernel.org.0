That's a clear bug, the order should be (client, port), so it's bugs
in the caller side.  They are rare use case, so probably no one really
hits or is annoyed -- the latter is a note-off just to be sure, and
the former is a special ioctl probably that has been never used :)

In anyway, would you send me a fix patch?


Thanks!
