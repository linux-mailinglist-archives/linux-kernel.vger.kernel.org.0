Hi,

Sorry for the late reply as I'm also on vacation this week :-)

So I pulled the patch and the revert of the ext4 revert as they're all
now merged in master. It of course made the problem go away...

To test the quality of the new jitter code, I added a small patch on
top to disable all other sources of randomness except the new jitter
entropy code, [1] and made quick tests on the quality of getrandom(0).

Using the "ent" tool, [2] also used to test randomness in the Stephen
Müller LRNG paper, on a 500000-byte file, produced the following
results:

    $ ent rand-file

    Entropy = 7.999625 bits per byte.

    Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 500000 byte file
    by 0 percent.

    Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 259.43, and randomly
    would exceed this value 41.11 percent of the times.

    Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4085 (127.5 = random).

    Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.148476594 (error 0.22 percent).

    Serial correlation coefficient is 0.001740 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).

As can be seen above, everything looks random, and almost all of the
statistical randomness tests matched the same kernel without the
"jitter + schedule()" patch added (after getting it un-stuck).

Thanks!
