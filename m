Correct.

I purposely avoided the full barriers of a successful cmpxchg() so that
we could clearly specify what we needed and why. As Andrea pointed out
[0], we need to understand if/when we require those memory barriers.

Once we've identified these, we may want to fold some of those barriers
back in, going from cmpxchg_relaxed() back to cmpxchg(). In particular
when we see patterns like:

    do {
        ....
    } while (!try_cmpxchg_relaxed());
    smp_mb();

or possibly:

    smp_mb();
    cmpxchg_relaxed(); /* no return value check */

Yes. Now that we added the extra state checking in desc_reserve(), this
ordering has become important.

However, for this case I would prefer to instead place a full memory
barrier immediately before @tail_id is incremented (in
desc_push_tail()). The tail-incrementing-task must have seen the
reusable state (even if it is not the one that set it) and an
incremented @tail_id must be visible to the task recycling a descriptor.

I do not understand. @blk->id has a data dependency on the provided
@tail_lpos. A random @tail_lpos value could be passed to this function
and it will only make a descriptor state change if the associated
descriptor is in the committed state and points back to that @tail_lpos
value. That is always legal.

If the old @blk->id value is read (just before data_alloc() writes it),
then the following desc_read() will return with desc_miss. That is
correct. If the new @blk->id value is read (just after data_alloc()
writes it), desc_read() will return with desc_reserved. This is also
correct. Why would this code care about @head_lpos or @tail_lpos
ordering to @blk->id? Please explain.

data_push_tail() is the only function that concerns itself with
@tail_lpos. Its cmpxchg-loop will prevent any unintended consequences.
And it uses the memory barrier pair data_push_tail:A/desc_reserve:A to
make sure that @tail_lpos reloads will successfully identify a changed
@tail_lpos due to descriptor recycling (which is the only reason that
@tail_lpos changes).

Why is it a problem if the movement of @head_lpos is seen before the
movement of @tail_lpos? Please explain.

Good catch! This secures probably the most critical point in your
design: when desc_reserve() recognizes that it needs to push the
descriptor tail.

The above comment section states twice why a full memory barrier is
needed: those writes may not have come from this task. We are not only
ordering the visible writes that this task performed, we are also
ordering the visible writes that this task has observed. Here is a
litmus test demonstrating this:

C full-mb-test

{}

P0(int *x, int *y)
{
	WRITE_ONCE(*x, 1);
}

P1(int *x, int *y)
{
	int tmp_x;

	tmp_x = READ_ONCE(*x);
	if (tmp_x) {
		smp_mb();
		WRITE_ONCE(*y, 1);
	}
}

P2(int *x, int *y)
{
	int tmp_x;
	int tmp_y;

	tmp_y = READ_ONCE(*y);
	smp_rmb();
	tmp_x = READ_ONCE(*x);
}

exists (2:tmp_x=0 /\ 2:tmp_y=1)

Running it yields:

What read barrier? This is a full barrier. A full barrier is _not_
equivalent to:

    smp_wmb();
    smp_rmb();

If the smp_mb() in the above litmus test is changed to smp_wmb(), the
test error-condition would exist. Adding an additional smp_rmb() would
still result in the error-condition. A full memory barrier is needed
here. (An acquire/release would be more efficient, but I am avoiding
those on purpose, sticking with the "better understood" memory
barriers.)

As mentioned above, I would put the smp_mb() before updating the
@tail_id. That would pair with this smp_mb() and avoid the false
positive on the @state_var check.
