See below.

It's not really well defined but thats a result of the gazillion
variants of irq chips which all have their own quirks. The wakeup
mechansims are also widely different, some of them are built into the
SOC, others require external logic. And a large part of these things is
completely undocumented. Welcome to my wonderful world.

So versus consistent wording. I'm fine with the paragraph you suggested,
but please amend it with something like this:

    If this does not hold, then either the underlying irq chip and the
    related driver need to be investigated.

Thanks,
