Hi Mark,

Thanks a lot for the detailed explanations, I did have a look at all the 
variations before posting this.

SM8150 is based on Cortex-A55(little cores) and Cortex-A76(big cores). 
I'm afraid I cannot give details about SC7180 yet.

We do not support KVM.

So this need not be strict?

Same here, this need not be strict?

I will get some more details from internal cpu team about this one.
