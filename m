I think tenant will have per core weight, similar to sched entity's per
cpu weight. The tenant's per core weight could derive from its
corresponding taskgroup's per cpu sched entities' weight(sum them up
perhaps). Tenant with higher weight will have its core wide vruntime
advance slower than tenant with lower weight. Does this address the
issue here?

Care to elaborate the idea of coresched idle thread concept?
How it solved the hyperthread going idle problem and what the accounting
issues and wakeup issues are, etc.

Thanks,
Aaron
