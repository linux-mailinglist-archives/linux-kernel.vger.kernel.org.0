Hi Doug / Robin,

I ran into this breaking things on OcteonTx boards based on CN80XX
CPU. The IOMMU configuration is a bit beyond me and I'm hoping you can
offer some advice. The IOMMU here is cavium,smmu-v2 as defined in
https://github.com/Gateworks/dts-newport/blob/master/cn81xx-linux.dtsi

Booting with 'arm-smmu.disable_bypass=n' does indeed work around the
breakage as the commit suggests.

Any suggestions for a proper fix?

Best Regards,

Tim
