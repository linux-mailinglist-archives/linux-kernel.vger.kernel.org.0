What you guys repeatedly called "checker" is GCC 8.

Intel's 0day bot reported this, and I was also able to reproduce the warnings
by using the kernel.org toolchain available at:
https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/files/bin/x86_64/8.1.0/x86_64-gcc-8.1.0-nolibc-sh4-linux.tar.xz


I also checked "git log --grep=Warray-bounds",
and I saw people were fixing this kind of warnings.
And, I am really annoyed by the 0day bot.

That's why I sent this patch
despite I have no interest in this driver.


Having said that, I cannot reproduce these warnings
by other compilers than sh4-linux-gcc.

So, probably these warnings are false positive.



Currently, I have 3 options I can do:

[1]  I will send an alternative patch to
     clarify the unreachable path for both compilers and humans
     without adding dead code.

  |@@ -351,6 +351,8 @@ static ssize_t fan_div_store(struct device *dev,
  |                tmp |= data->fan_div[2] << 4;
  |                smsc47m1_write_value(data, SMSC47M2_REG_FANDIV3, tmp);
  |                break;
  |+       default:
  |+               unreachable();
  |        }
  |
  |        /* Preserve fan min */

[2] I will send your feed-backs to the maintainer of 0day bot,
    and persuade him to stop reporting this.

[3] I will accept that 0day bot will continue sending this report forever.
    So, I will configure my mailer so that this report
    will immediately go to the trash box.




As I already said, I have _zero_ interest in this driver.

Only the problem I have is, I repeatedly receive annoying reports
from 0day bot, where my patch is not the root cause of the warnings at all.

Looks like you both believe the current code is OK as-is,
so I am not sure you are happy with [1].

I can try [2] first.

[3] is the last resort for me.
