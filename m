I have not actually until now; I didn't consider doing stuff with the
resv_map while not holding onto the resv_map->lock. I guess that's the
small race you're talking about. Seems fine to me, but I'm more
worried about hanging off the vma below.

I actually did consider hanging off the info to uncharge off the vma,
but I didn't for a couple of reasons:

1. region_del is called from hugetlb_unreserve_pages, and I don't have
access to the vma there. Maybe there is a way to query the proper vma
I don't know about?
2. hugetlb_reserve_pages seems to be able to conduct a reservation
with a NULL *vma. Not sure what to do in that case.

Is there a way to get around these that I'm missing here?

FWIW I think tracking is better in resv_map since the reservations are
in resv_map themselves. If I do another structure, then for each
reservation there will be an entry in resv_map and an entry in the new
structure and they need to be kept in sync and I need to handle errors
for when they get out of sync.
