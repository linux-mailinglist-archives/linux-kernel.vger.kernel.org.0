This indicates that the extent tree blocks for the journal was found
to be corrupt; so the journal couldn't be found.

But e2fsck had no problem finding the journal.

And no other significant problems were found.  (Ext4 never updates or
relies on the summary number of free blocks and free inodes, since
updating it is a scalability bottleneck and these values can be
calculated from the per block group free block/inodes count.  So the
fact that e2fsck needed to update them is not an issue.)

So that implies that we got one set of values when we read the journal
inode when attempting to mount the file system, and a *different* set
of values when e2fsck was run.  Which makes means that we need
consider the possibility that the problem is below the file system
layer (e.g., the block layer, device drivers, etc.).

This variety of issues also implies that the issue may be in the data
read by the file system, as opposed to an issue in the file system.

Arthur, can you give us the full details of your hardware
configuration and your kernel config file?  Also, what kernel git
commit ID were you testing?
