This patch came again and it didn't have any comments to this effect in
the code around the flag.

So do you restore the frequency of the PLL manually? Or that is done by
calling clk_set_rate() on the leaf clk again?

I'm suggesting that the clk framework needs to be told that the PLL has
lost the rate and thus should do a save/restore of the registers so that
the clk framework can be back in sync with the clk hardware. Maybe it's
as simple as calling clk_set_rate(&pll, XO_RATE) or clk_set_parent(&pll,
&xo_clk), so that we can recalc the rate down the tree and fix up the
child clk frequencies. Or, maybe we need to add some sort of mechanism
to the clk framework so it can be told that the frequency here has
changed. Or we need to add a hook in the power domain for the DP PLL to
tell the clk framework that the clk has changed rate and thus should
recalc down to the children. Something like this, instead of an obtuse
flag that tells us very little about what's going on.
