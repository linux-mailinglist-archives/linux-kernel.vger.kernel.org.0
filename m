It shouldn't.  The task will never change in that case, interrupts are
disabled as the instruction runs.

That's true, but gdb runs at human speed.  There will always be a timer
interrupt pending.

Yes.  You hit a breakpoint, the user does whatever then does a continue
or single-step.  Which is, of course, not true of the other single-step
users, as you say.

I'm not sure messing around with the GIC is really the right solution.
But, it's an interesting idea.

I'm not sure how to proceed from here, though.
