I do not think hibernation can choose which swap device to use. Having
an additional swap device migh help though because there will be more
space to swap out to.

OK, I can see it now. I forgot about the ugly hack in the page allocator
that hibernation is using. If there is no way to make a forward progress
for the allocation and we enter the allocator oom path (__alloc_pages_may_oom)
pm_suspended_storage() bails out early and the allocator gives up.

That being said allocator would swap out processes so it doesn't make
much sense to do that pro-actively. It can still fail if the swap is
depleted though and then the hibernation gives up. This makes some sense
because you wouldn't like to have something killed by the oom killer
while hibernating right? Graceful failure should be a preferable action
and let you decide what to do IMHO.
