I think synchronize_srcu_expedited.

synchronize_expedited sends lots of IPI and is bad for realtime VMs.

The question is this: is this still a gain if we switch to the
more expensive srcu? If yes then we can keep the feature on,
if not we'll put it off until next release and think
of better solutions. rcu->srcu is just a find and replace,
don't see why we need to defer that. can be a separate patch
for sure, but we need to know how well it works.
