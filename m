Things like this should usually find a different home: drivers/misc
tends to be for one-of-a-kind stuff with a user interface, not for things
where you have multiple chips doing the same thing.

If you think there are going to be additional cases where you have
more than one bmc in need of a user interface for the same
functionality, we could introduce a drivers/bmc/ subsystem and
have a set of user interfaces backed by a set of chip specific
drivers.

I don't think there is a rush here, so let's do that for the following
merge window.
