x86 appears to have an asm/prctl.h implementation, but it's not included
by anybody so I guess that doesn't really help us here.

Certainly not a big issue, just that the harder we make this to change
the better.

Duplication is grotty, but it does the job so I'm ok with it. I don't have
any better ideas.

Thanks,
