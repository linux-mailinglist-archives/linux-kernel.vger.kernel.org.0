Thanks a lot for the patchset. I am still going through the patchset
and trying to understand how will it impact
kexec use-cases, namely:

1. kexec_load() and kecec_file_load(), use '--initrd=<file>' like
command line options.

2. We have several kexec based bootloader implementations (for example
linuxboot, see (a) and (b) below) that replaces specific firmware
functionality like the UEFI DXE phase with a Linux kernel and runtime
and find the initrd image (for example, uroot) from that same
filesystem. So these would need modification(s) similar to the OVMF
AAVMF and u-boot, right?

a. https://www.linuxboot.org/
b. https://github.com/linuxboot/linuxboot/blob/master/dxe/linuxboot.c

Thanks,
Bhupesh
