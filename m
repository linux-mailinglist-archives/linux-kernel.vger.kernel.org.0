Well this depends on how big a problem we think the number mismatch is.
Right now it's pretty annoying because numbers aren't matching for
non-CMIC controllers in simple setups on boot. I think having a small
patch that makes it more consistent for the static would be worth it and
if CMIC controllers with significant hot-plug events have mismatches
that seems more understandable to me.

Well then we'd have to be able to do everything that's possible with a
controller via the subsystem and it would have to multiplex all admin
commands for CMIC ones, etc to a sensible controller. This might make
sense in the long term but it sounds like a larger project than I have
time to take on.
