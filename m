We prototyped something very similar to this patch series in the past.

One problem that came up is that if you get into direct reclaim,
because persistent memory can have pretty low write throughput, you
can end up stalling users for a pretty long time while migrating
pages.

To mitigate that, we tried changing background reclaim to start
migrating much earlier (but not otherwise reclaiming), however it
drastically increased the code complexity and still had the chance of
not being able to catch up with pressure.

Because of that, we moved to a solution based on the proactive reclaim
of idle pages, that was presented at LSFMM earlier this year:
