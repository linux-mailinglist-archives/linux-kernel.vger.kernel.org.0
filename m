Thank you very much!

Unfortunately, I found some issue with locking in patch 6
(sorry for late finding):
loopback_parse_timer_id() uses snd_card_ref(), that can lock on mutex,
also snd_timer_instance_new() uses non-atomic allocation, that can sleep.
So, both functions can not be called from loopback_snd_timer_open()
with cable->lock spinlock locked.

Also, most part of loopback_snd_timer_open() function body works
when the opposite stream of the same cable does not yet exist, and
the current stream is not yet completely open and can't be running,
so existing locking of loopback->cable_lock mutex is enough to protect
from conflicts with simultaneous opening or closing.

So, it looks like locking of cable->lock spinlock is not needed
in loopback_snd_timer_open() at all
(similarly to loopback_snd_timer_close_cable()).

I'm sending a separate patch to fix this:
https://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2019-November/159087.h
tml

Also, when you requested to move tasklet_init() call to before
snd_timer_open() call, I should have guessed to look into the
reverse closing side too ;-)
Now, I have to add one more patch to move tasklet_kill() call
to after snd_timer_close().
https://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2019-November/159088.h
tml

Please, take a look at the patches.

Thanks!

Best regards,
Andrew
