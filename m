No worries and thanks for taking the time to look at this!

It is possible and I did consider it. But it didn't feel right because:

	1. The same can be achieved with regular affinities.
	2. On some systems, especially medium and lower end devices the number
	   of big cores might be small (2 bigs and 6 littles is common).
	   I couldn't justify that pinning to bigs is always better than
	   letting the system try to balance itself in case it gets overloaded.

The thing with RT is that generally we offer little guarantees if the system is
not designed properly and the user can easily shoot themselves in the foot.

This implementation offered the simplest best effort while still not being too
restrictive.

But the idea is valid and worth looking at in the future.
