I got your mail from June 1st via LKML and this one directly and via
LKML. It's in the pile of the other ~1000 mails in my backlog as I was out
on vacation and travel. Just because people do not reply immediately does
not mean they ignore you.

That does not make sense. This brings the MSI code back to the state which
it had _BEFORE_ I reworked the vector allocation and MSI code. It rather
looks like this patch unearths some other weird issue in that Marvell NIC
(or the driver) which was not visible before. And looking at the code the
hardware has known problems with MSI interrupts and uses a magic probe
function to verify whether they work at all.

Can you please provide the content of /proc/interrupts with the driver
loaded and working after boot (don't hibernate) for the following kernels:

  Linus upstream

  Linus upstream + revert

  4.14 stable (that's before the big overhaul of the vector/msi code)

Thanks,

	tglx
