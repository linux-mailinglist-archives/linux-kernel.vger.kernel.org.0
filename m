If the DP phy isn't connected then having it be marked as status =3D
"disabled" is the typical approach to the problem. I agree it may not be
used on some particular board using the SoC, but this is an SoC that is
made once so we should be able to describe it regardless of how it's
used by some board.

If we can make the clks 'required' and not cause the DTS checker system
to blow up then I'll be happy.

I hope we can have a property like:
=09
	clocks =3D <&gcc KNOWN_CLK>, <0>, <0>, <&dp_phy 1>;

where <0> means "I don't know right now", and that will be enough to
please the checker and can be filled in later on when we sort out the
HDMI and DP bindings. If this doesn't work then I guess I'll just have
to get over it and complain to Rob Herring.
