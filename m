Alexei,

Do you still need such a feature?

Note, I just pushed my tree to my for-next tree, and also have a
ftrace/direct branch that ends with this patch set that is the basis of
the rest of the work of my code. Feel free to build against that
branch if you need to have something built on the net tree.
