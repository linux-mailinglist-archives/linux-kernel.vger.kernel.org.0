OK, that fence is because we allow invalid translations to be cached, which is a 
completely different issue.

RISC-V implementations are allowed to have software managed accessed/dirty 
bits.  For some reason I thought we were relying on the firmware to handle 
this, but I can't actually find the code so I might be crazy.  Wherever it's 
done, there's no spec enforcing it so we should leave this true on RISC-V.

Thanks!
