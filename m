Fair enough.  Although, with #AC, we know a priori that the address is
unaligned, so we could at least print "Unaligned access at 0x%lx\n".
But we can certainly leave these details to someone else.

(For context, there are patches floating around to enable a formerly
secret CPU feature to generate #AC on a LOCK instruction that spans a
cache line.)
