I mixed up a few things in there; that low-power mode is supposed to do
higher increments, so it would emulate a similar frequency as the non-low-power
mode. Thus the actual frequency matters less than what is reported in CNTFRQ
(though we hope to get the behaviour we're told we should see), so we should
be quite safe from that ~5KHz value. Still, to make it obvious, I don't think
something like this would hurt:
