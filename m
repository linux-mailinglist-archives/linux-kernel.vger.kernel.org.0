I remember that there are already the lists which you concern. Maybe we
can try to solve those problems one by one.

1. deadlock issue? cause by kmalloc() after kfree()?
2. decrease allocation fail, to modify GFP_NOWAIT flag to GFP_KERNEL?
3. check whether slim 48 bytes (sizeof (qlist_object) +
sizeof(kasan_alloc_meta)) and additional unique stacktrace in
stackdepot?
4. duplicate struct 'kasan_track' information in two different places

Would you have any other concern? or?
