It's an automatically generated fuzz test.

There's rarely any such thing as a "bad" fuzz test.  If userspace can do
something that causes the kernel to crash or hang, it's a kernel bug, with very
few exceptions (e.g. like writing to /dev/mem).

If there are cases that aren't supported, like sockets that don't support a
certain function or whatever, then the code needs to check for those cases and
return an error, not hang the kernel.
