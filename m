I have added SO_TIMESTAMP* to every Bluetooth socket a while back. And that should be used by the majority of the tools. One exception might by hcidump which has been replaced by btmon already anyway.

So I would not bother with HCI_TIME_STAMP fixing. We can do 2) if someone really still wants to use that socket option. However I am under the impression that 3) should be already possible.

Regards

Marcel
