The CMD13 is currently not used when polling, because we set the
send_status parameter to false in the calls to __mmc_switch(). So this
should already be covered, according to your suggestions. Right?

When it comes to keeping the clock rate as is, before sending the CMD6
- I fully agree that it's a good idea when doing a periodic retuning.
As you would expect things to work as they are.

The problem is, when you have received a CRC error and the re-tuning
is being triggered because of that. In that case it may be a better
option to decrease the clock rate, at least that is what I recall
Adrian needs for his cases. Adrian?

What will happen when you receive a CRC error and there is re-tuning
triggered, is that something you have seen happening on you boards?

Yep, makes sense.
