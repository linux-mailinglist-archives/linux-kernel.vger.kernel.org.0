The fwupd issue *Dell TB16: ASMedia USB controller can't be updated* [1] 
was closed by the “stale robot”.

Thank you. I’ll try to do that on Monday.

That’s how it should work theoretically, but have you ever dealt with 
Dell’s first level support? They have little experience with Ubuntu, and 
if you are unlucky, they say that Ubuntu support is not done by Dell but 
“by the Linux community”. If you are lucky to not get this answer, they 
do (Google) searches, telling you, your problem is solved by referencing 
only similar sounding problems from the Ubuntu *user* forums. If the 
firmware has a bug (in the UI!), they ask you to install Microsoft 
Windows to see if that solves the issue. If you tell them, the Linux 
developers analyzed the problem, and they say the following solution 
have to be found, they do not know what that means. It’s very annoying 
and time consuming often for naught.


Kind regards,

Paul
