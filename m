Weird.  I don't have access to Rawhide at the moment so I can't
recreate.  It builds fine for me on Fedora 29.

But I don't see how those warnings could get enabled: -Wsign-compare
-Wunused-parameter.

Can you "make clean" and do "make V=1 tools/objtool" to show the actual
flags?

The reported warnings do seem reasonable though, maybe we should fix
them regardless and explicitly enable the warnings.
