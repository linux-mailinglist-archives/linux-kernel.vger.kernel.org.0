OK, I think I understand now: chiptop != RCU
so RCU really only has one purpose: handling resets
while chiptop manages all the random bits

does this means we don't need RCU to match "syscon"?

have you already discussed using only one reset cell?
if there's only one big reset controller in RCU then why not let the
reset controller driver do it's job of translating a reset line? also
this represents the hardware best (dt-bindings should describe the
hardware, drivers then translate that into the various subsystems
offered by the kernel).

we have to translate it into:
- status register and bit
- reset register and bit

for LGM the implementation seems to be the easiest because the reset
line can be mapped easily to the registers and bit offsets (for
example like reset-meson.c does it, which also supports 256 reset
lines together with for example
include/dt-bindings/reset/amlogic,meson-g12a-reset.h. the latter is
nice to have but optional)
we can then implement special translation logic (in other words: a
separate of_xlate callback) for VRX200 which then has to do more
"magic" (like you have shown in your example code above: "if the reset
line belongs to the second set of 32 reset lines then use reset offset
X and status offset Y" - or even use a translation table as
reset-imx7.c does)

the current binding is a mix of specifying reset register and bit in
.dts but calculating the status register.
I missed the calculation of the status register until you pointed it out earlier
