Regarding 'improve compression but probably at the cost of cpu' ... what would be 
the proper way to evaluate this effect?
As for backward compatibility, I do not see side effects of using larger buffers. 
Data in the compressed state might differ indeed, but it will sill conform to zlib
standard and thus can be decompressed.

BTW, I have sent around V2 of the patch set. I would appreciate if you take a look 
as well.
