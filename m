Ah, does it provides the same interface as hwmon to userspace ? Sorry but
I haven't spent much time looking at IIO yet, but since there are similar
needs to share protocol between subsystems in the kernel, this was just
an example that I listed as recently some requirement to add IIO SCMI
support had come up. If we can achieve hwmon kind of interface with iio->hwmon,
we should do that. We have other examples like devfreq and cpufreq, genpd
and regulators.

This patch is optional at least as of now (but good to have for completeness),
if the driver provides no name, we just match on protocol id only.
