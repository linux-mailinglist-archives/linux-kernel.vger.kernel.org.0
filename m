Well, I would be certainly more happy with a more consistent behavior.
Talked to Hugh at LSFMM about this and he finds treating shmem objects
separately from the anonymous memory. And that is already the case
partially when each mount point might have its own setup. So the primary
question is whether we need a one global knob to controll all THP
allocations. One argument to have that is that it might be helpful to
for an admin to simply disable source of THP at a single place rather
than crawling over all shmem mount points and remount them. Especially
in environments where shmem points are mounted in a container by a
non-root. Why would somebody wanted something like that? One example
would be to temporarily workaround high order allocations issues which
we have seen non trivial amount of in the past and we are likely not at
the end of the tunel.

That being said I would be in favor of treating the global sysfs knob to
be global for all THP allocations. I will not push back on that if there
is a general consensus that shmem and fs in general are a different
class of objects and a single global control is not desirable for
whatever reasons.

Kirill, Hugh othe folks?
