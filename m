Some more afterthoughts on my research that came to me:

In the early indie homecomputing environment such as Amiga we see anti-schi=
zophrenic designs, and an anti-pop ("nerd") culture, that also is anti-schi=
zophrenic.

Lesser schizophrenia seems to be based in un-accurate thinking. Greater Sch=
izophrenia is drug-based and cannot be cured. Lesser Schizophrenia can be d=
efeated to some extent, maybe wholly, and a computer programmer needs to ha=
ve accurate thinking, for a good O.S. That is why we see a popular anti-sch=
izophrenic culture such as The Amiga, be accurate in thinking, and of high =
quality. And remembered for this.

Unfortunately the drinking culture of Amiga was that of daily tavern visits=
 which was reflected in atleast common weekend partying for many of its fan=
s, making way for windows which was atleast as drunk.

In 2000, we see the peoples belief move further toward popculture as popula=
rity becomes great, and so the anti-schizophrenic angle is lost. And typica=
lly the LSD/Psilocybin angle gets greater. Clearly see in Apple Mac. And St=
eve Jobs (rip), still selling flashy phones.

So I have included the forementioned cider, as this is the mushroom god red=
uced to Cider, which is the least one can do, and needs to have popularity =
of its kind, taking over this again, with an anti-schizophrenic measure, mo=
re like that of The Amiga, but now being the Source Available Unix-derivati=
ve I am working on.

Furthermore historically the mushroom god was reduced to minimal, the regre=
ssions of Adams god to Odn, and then Tor, which the Varangers again changed=
 to Tyr, which is an empty concept, as much as a god can be.

Tyr again still compatbile with the kind of quality measures we want, and V=
aranger culture, a big culture wanting so.

And what if we further change the useless threeletter gods to an economic s=
ystem, which CAN be three letters. Indeed if you want serious religion they=
 you need a 500-page book like The Quran, and ALLAH.

Three letters will never be this, nor a mushroom regressed bible.

And Varanger culture indeed was more like muslims, having once believed in =
Adams god.

A computer OS with up and download of files, can be a three letter system, =
and I have renamed it to TSX O.S.  "Transaction Streaming Unix-derivative".=
 Supporting all ciderproduction in the world, for a an anti-schizophrenic f=
orce, as much as can be in pop culture.

Still ofcourse with the fair pay princples this began with. So much better =
than regressed churches and facist kings. Let this money stream through her=
e instead, For The People, as a democracy supposedly should be.
