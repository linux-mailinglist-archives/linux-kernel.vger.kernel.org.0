I agree that the code and patch read confusingly due to the (lack of)
context. The commit message attempted to explain that, but clearer code
seems preferable to confusing-but-explained code.

I sent a new version of this patch, which instead just moves the
assignment to sbi's group count earlier, so that the error message can
continue referencing it that way. (That also addresses the warning.)
