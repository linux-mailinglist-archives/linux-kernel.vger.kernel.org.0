Yes, after going through all the users of interval-tree,  I agree that
they all want to use [start,end intervals.

It might be the safest way, although I really hate having another
header file for interval_tree... The following is a diffstat of a
tentative conversion (I'll send the patch separately); I'm not sure
if a single shot conversion would be acceptable, albeit with relevant
maintainer acks.

This gets rid of 'end - 1' trick from the users and converts
cond1 and cond2 checks in interval_tree_generic.h

Note that I think amdgpu_vm.c actually uses fully open intervals.

Yes, we're talking about the same thing, but I overcomplicated things by
considering memtype lookups to be different than the nodes in the tree;
which obviously doesn't make sense... it is actually [a,b[ as you mention.

This should have been my first approach.

My original expectation was to actually remove a lot more of pat_rbtree,
including the is_node_overlap() and the filtering. Yes, I think this can
be done if the interval-tree is converted to [a,b[ and we can thus
just iterate the tree seamlessly.

No, no endpoints are modified in pat.

I think doing the conversion you suggested to [a,b[ for all users, then
redoing this series on top of that would be the way to move forward.
