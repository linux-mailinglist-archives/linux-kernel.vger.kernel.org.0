I have been thinking more about this. The above seems like a
reasonable assumption to make. So, I started to hack and improve the
SDIO IRQ management, again.

Just to be clear, I like the approach Matthias has taken here, which
means reading SDIO_CCCR_INTx register at system resume, to understand
whether there are some SDIO IRQs that needs to be processed, however
there are some more corner cases that needs to be covered as well.

Let me post something on Monday, then we can continue our discussions
and run some tests as well.

Have nice weekend!
