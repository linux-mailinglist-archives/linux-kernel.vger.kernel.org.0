Was any of the above the case for your soft lockup case? How have you
managed to trigger it? As I've said I am not against the patch but I
would really like to see an actual explanation what happened rather than
speculations of what might have happened. If for nothing else then for
the future reference.

If this is really about all the hierarchy being MEMCG_PROT_MIN protected
and that results in a very expensive and pointless reclaim walk that can
trigger soft lockup then it should be explicitly mentioned in the
changelog.
