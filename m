If the zapped class is at the end of the chain, the shorten one without
the zapped class should have been stored already as the current code
will store all its predecessor chains. If it is somewhere in the middle,
there is no guarantee that the partial chain will actually happen. It
may just clutter up the hash and make searching slower. Why don't we
just store it when it actually happens?
