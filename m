And just to add, I've personally been involved in two patches to unbreak
the purgatory because of changes that broke it only at runtime, not
build time, which would both have been caught by Hans's patchset.

[1] ca14c996afe7 ("x86/purgatory: Disable the stackleak GCC plugin for the purgatory")
[2] bec500777089 ("lib/string: Make memzero_explicit() inline instead of external")
