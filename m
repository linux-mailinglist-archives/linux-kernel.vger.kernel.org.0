I don't think so, but I've run so many tests, I'm not 100% positive.
Let me go double check and get back to you.

Hmm, not exactly sure.  I will test.

Which GPIO maps to which pin is different -
45 - TX
46 - RX
47 - CTS
48 - RFR (RTS)

However, accounting for that, yes that corresponds to what I used.

I don't have a scope/logic analyzer, but since I hooked up the
blsp_bam I'm able to see the raw data from the uart before it gets to
the HCI stack or anything.  As a side note, having the bam or not
seemed to have no effect on the issue.  Most of the time the data was
one byte (zero), some times it was a string of zero bytes.  Rarely it
would be random data.

Agreed.
