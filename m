There were some concerns about the breaking the existing setup in the past.

Personally, it makes sense to me. I am okay with upgrading FSBL to 
update the DT once the patches are in mainline. In fact, I used to do 
that for topology patch series. This will help to add any new DT entry 
in future as well.

However, if SiFive can share a prebuilt FSBL image for everybody to 
upgrade, that would be very helpful.
