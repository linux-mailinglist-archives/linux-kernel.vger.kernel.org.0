A revert of the single commit is sufficient.  Previously I have
checked out and compiled the tree at commit b059f801a937 and
b059f801a937^ (with caret, the previous commit).  It worked with the
previous commit, but not with b059f801a937.

4ce97317f41d *is* the previous commit to b059f801a937, so it was in
both kernels that I tested:

$ git log -1 --oneline b059f801a937^ | cat
4ce97317f41d x86/purgatory: Do not use __builtin_memcpy and __builtin_memset
$ 

And, I also did an exploratory 'git revert b059f801a937' at the tip of
the tree.  That corrects the problem as well.

So both say that it's only the single commit that would need to be
reverted *if* that's the route taken.

Now, on to seeing if we can narrow this down to a fix with no reverts
instead.
