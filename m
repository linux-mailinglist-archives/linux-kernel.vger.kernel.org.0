PSTATE.SS isn't an enable bit for single step ... its part of a bigger state-machine.
(my made-up terminology for it is 'PSTATE.Suppress-Step'...)

The diagram in the Arm-Arm's D2.12.3 "The software step state machine" may help.

MDSCR_EL1.SS enables single-step, if PSTATE.D is clear the CPU will now take step
exceptions instead of pretty much anything else. (active pending state)
To execute one instruction you need to ERET with SPSR_ELx.SS set. (active, not pending)
The CPU will execute one instruction, then clear PSTATE.SS. (taking us back to active pending)

Taking an exception clears PSTATE.SS so that you know you're in active-pending state, and
will take a step exception once you re-enable debug with PSTATE.D. This lets you step the
exception handlers.
(if it was set, you wouldn't see the first instruction in the step handler, if it was
inherited, you couldn't know if you would see the first instruction or not).
If you take something other than a step exception, PSTATE.SS will be preserved in SPSR_EL1.SS.


What I think you are seeing is the step exception once debug is re-enabled, after taking
an exception you didn't want. This happens because MDSCR_EL1.SS is still set.

Yes, arch_prepare_kprobe() checks search_exception_tables() for locations that we know may
cause page faults. These are blacklisted.
