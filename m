I am still interested in the _checked versions and have a WIP patch that
adds that to btrfs (that was my original plan) but haven't had enough
time to finalize it. The patch itself is simple, the missing part is to
understand and document what the saturated counters would do with the
structures.

If the _checked helpers are really bothering for you, then well remove
it, but I think it's a good API extension that makes the full-refcount
semantics independent of the config.
