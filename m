Unless I'm mistaken, the dwc3 driver in this case is the
usb-role-switch. The DWC3 IP includes both USB dost and device blocks,
i.e. it's a dual role controller. Drivers like tcpm.c that negotiate
the actual role need to tell the outcome of the negotiation to the
dwc3 driver. So I think this part is OK.

The platform has also some kind of discrete switch for routing the
signals to either Standard-A (the hub) or Type-C connector, so it does
not represent the usb-role-switch. It should however affect the USB role,
as if that switch routes the data signals to the Standard-A port (to
the hub) instead of USB Type-C, the USB role needs to be fixed to host
mode.

I guess this series does not include the driver for that discrete
switch/mux. I don't remember/know how that switch was planned to be
handled.
