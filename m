Subject: [PATCH 00/13] arm: calxeda: update DTS, bindings and MAINTAINERS

Hi,

this series is an answer to the attempt [1] of removing the Calxeda
Highbank platform support from the kernel. Apart from the pending removal
of ARM32 host KVM support from the kernel, the lack of proper DT schema
bindings was another major reason for Rob's series.

This series addresses this. The first four patches adjust the .dts files
to pass the existing (mostly generic) DT schema binding checks. Those
changes should not affect the functionality.
The following eight patches then convert the "prose" DT binding
documentation to the json-schema format, so that the automatic checking
actually does something useful.
After those patches "make dtbs_check" comes back clean for the two .dts
files in the kernel, and "dt_validate -m" reports only those three
not-covered nodes (on Highbank, only the last one on Midway):
arm,cortex-a9-twd-timer
arm,cortex-a9-twd-wdt
calxeda,hb-sdhci
The first two are generic ARM devices, for which the binding doc just
does not have been converted yet. The SDHCI controller is actually
disabled in the DTs, and the SD slot is populated on very few special
systems only, also there has never been a driver in the kernel for
this device anyway.

The final patch then changes the MAINTAINERS file to hand over the
maintainership to me. I have a working machine under my desk and have
some interest in keeping this platform support alive.

Cheers,
Andre.
