Subhra posted a patch that incrementally searches for an idle CPU in the LLC,
remembering the last CPU examined, and searching a fixed number of CPUs from there.
That technique is compatible with the one that Viresh suggests; the incremental
search would stop if a SCHED_IDLE cpu was found.

I also fiddled with select_idle_sibling, maintaining a per-LLC bitmap of idle CPUs,
updated with atomic operations.  Performance was basically unchanged for the
workloads I tested, and I inserted timers around the idle search showing it was
a very small fraction of time both before and after my changes.  That led me to
ignore the push side and optimize the pull side with task stealing.

I would be very interested in hearing from folks that have workloads that demonstrate
that select_idle_sibling is too expensive.
