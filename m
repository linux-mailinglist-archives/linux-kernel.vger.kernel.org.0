So the capacitor on the input of the p-FET is keeping the switch on?
When I say it's not switching with the clock I mean it's not constantly
bouncing on and off at whatever rate the clock is going at.

You could include that in your quirk?

I think you are going to end up with a hack no matter what.

It would be better if it wasn't in the core, that keeps everything
partitioned off nicely.

The majority of regulators that need clocks are PWM devices which is a
whole other thing that we already support.  This is a highly unusual
hardware design, we don't have the regmap stuff in the core and that's a
lot more common.
