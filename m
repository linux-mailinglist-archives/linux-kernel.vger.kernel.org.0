ok. Thanks for the clarification

The input could mean that this system reaches a particular level of
utilization and load that is close to the threshold between 2
different behavior like spare capacity and fully_busy/overloaded case.
But at the opposite, there is less threads that CPUs in your UCs so
one group at least at NUMA level should be tagged as
has_spare_capacity and should pull tasks.

When task wakes up, we can decide to
- speedup the wakeup and shorten the list of cpus and compare only
prev_cpu vs this_cpu (in fact the group of cpu that share their
respective LLC). That's the fast wakeup path that is used most of the
time during a wakeup
- or start to find the idlest CPU of the system and scan all domains.
That's the slow path that is used for new tasks or when a task wakes
up a lot of other tasks at the same time

ok the fact that they join up might be the root cause of your problem.
They will wake up at the same time by the same task and CPU.

That fact that the 4 nodes works well but not the 8 nodes is a bit
surprising except if this means more NUMA level in the sched_domain
topology
Could you give us more details about the sched domain topology ?

The standard tracepoint is a good starting point but tracing the
statistings for find_busiest_group and find_idlest_group should help a
lot.
