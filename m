You seem to have the most conservative ideas around)

I wasn't actually thinking about KVM enforcing anything here, my goal
was to provide guest with enough information so it can adjust its SMT
related settings accordingly. These could be:
- 'nosmt'
- STIBP
- Core scheduling (not yet upstream afaik)
- Manual vCPU pinning for certain tasks (including running nested
guests). [E.g. nested Hyper-V hides 'md_clear' from its guests when it
doesn't see 'NoNonarchitecturalCoreSharing' from the underlying
hypervisor as it's pointless]
- (Liran's idea): Using SMT information for better scheduling

KVM_FEATURE_NO_SMT would cover one case, however, it's basically the
same as not exposing hyperthreads by KVM userspace, just enforced. Do
you think that such enforcement makes sense? What the guest is supposed
to do when it sees the flag (compared to what's doing now)?

('KVM_HINTS_REALTIME' may actually imply what we want, however, judging
by its name it may gain additional meaning in the future like 'always do
busy polling everywhere')
