Sorry for a delay.
Eventually I found time to check this.

Unfortunately the efi=noruntime didn't help:

# uname -a
Linux buildroot 5.3.0-rc7+ #17 Thu Sep 5 16:08:22 EEST 2019 i586 GNU/Linux
# dmidecode
# dmidecode 4.2
Scanning /dev/mem for entry point.
# No SMBIOS nor DMI entry point found, sorry.
#
# cat /proc/cmdline
... ignore_loglevel efi=noruntime earlycon=efifb acpi_rsdp=0xf01e014

So, I am all ears to anything else to try.
