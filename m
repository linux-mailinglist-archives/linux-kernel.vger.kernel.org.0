FWIW I remember digging into that same message a while back (although 
I've forgotten which particular GPU I was playing with at the time), and 
concluded that the STACK_PWRON/STACK_READY registers might just not be 
implemented on some GPUs, and/or this easy-to-overlook register bit 
could be some kind of enable for the functionality:

https://github.com/ianmacd/d2s/blob/master/drivers/gpu/arm/b_r16p0/backend/gpu/mali_kbase_pm_driver.c#L1631

Since even in kbase this is all behind an 'expert' config option, I'm 
inclined to agree that just dropping it from panfrost unless and until 
it proves necessary is probably preferable to adding more logic and 
inscrutable register-magic.
