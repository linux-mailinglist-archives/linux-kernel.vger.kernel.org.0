If you have a CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN kernel, this will not be
little-endian, nor will other fields in your header (e.g. the image
size), so I would recommend dropping this for now.

To manage that for the image_size field you'll probably need to play the
same linker trick games we play on arm64.

It's probably worth having:

#ifdef CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
#error conversion of header fields to LE not yet implemented
#endif

... to catch that later.

Thanks,
Mark,
