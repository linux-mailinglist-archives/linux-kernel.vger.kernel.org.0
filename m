wow, that's a very slow command bandwith, is this because of a low frame 
rate or the SLIMbus transport in the middle?

At any rate, we've got to improve the bank switch. The intent of the 
alternate banks is that software mirrors the register settings in the 
background and only updates what needs to be changed during the 
enable/disable part. when you operate with a fixed clock frequency 
usually it's only the channel enable that changes so it could be very 
fast (1 write deferred to the SSP point).

On the intel side our command bandwidth is comparable with the usual 
I2C/HDaudio codecs, but still things complicated and slower than they 
should be. I have been chasing a bug happening on bank switches in 
multi-stream configurations for 10+ days and it's quite hard to debug at 
the moment.

One possibility is to use regmap for the banked registers, and a manual 
mirroring after each bank switch. Or maybe we could even have an 
extension of regmap to do this for us.
