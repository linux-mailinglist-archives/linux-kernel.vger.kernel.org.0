Actually most(?) Bifrost GPUs support the "legacy" 'LPAE-ish' page table
format. So the only kernel change *required* is adding the compatible
string (and any SoC-specific quirks).

The support for "blob-on-Panfrost" is currently an experimental internal
investigation. So I can't make any promises about it ever being released
publicly.

Indeed since it's the same kernel driver the same compatibility layer
can be used to run Midgard DDK blob on Panfrost. Although given the
progress that has already occurred with the Mesa Panfrost user space you
might be able to simply switch to a completely open stack (available now).

Again I'm afraid I'm not in a position to give any guarantees that my
prototype blob-on-Panfrost work will actually be released or timescales
of when. However since the current focus internally is on newer GPUs I'm
less confident that there will be interest for Midgard DDK on Panfrost.
