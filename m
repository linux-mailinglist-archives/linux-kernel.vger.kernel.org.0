We actually need them before a driver claims the device.

The reason is that when we create that child platform device we set the 
device's IORESOURCE_IO resources according to the translated logic PIO 
addresses, and not the host bus address. This is what makes the host 
transparent to the child device driver.

BTW, as you may have noticed, in v3 I said I would drop this patch and 
fix it all properly.

My problem is that I need to ensure that the new logical PIO unregister 
function works ok for hot-pluggable host bridges. I need to get some way 
to test this. Advice?

Thanks,
John
