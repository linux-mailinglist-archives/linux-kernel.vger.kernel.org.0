Why are you using SRCU notifier chains for events?

What are you using them for like this, what in-kernel code is this so
that I can see what you are doing?

That feels like a very slow way of doing things, especially given the
recent changes in compilers due to Spectre issues.

I suggest not using notifier chains for events :)

Seriously, try something local for your specific notifiers first.  It
should be easy to just add tracing for all of them using ftrace or bpf,
right?
