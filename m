It's really straightforward...here is the match between headers and 
functionality:

[PATCH v2 1/5] soundwire: sdw_slave: add new fields to track probe status
[PATCH v2 02/19] soundwire: fix race between driver probe and 
update_status callback

[PATCH v2 2/5] soundwire: add enumeration_complete structure
[PATCH v2 12/19] soundwire: add enumeration_complete signaling

[PATCH v2 3/5] soundwire: add initialization_complete definition
[PATCH v2 13/19] soundwire: bus: add initialization_complete signaling

[PATCH v2 4/5] soundwire: intel: update interfaces between ASoC and 
SoundWire
[PATCH v2 5/5] soundwire: intel: update stream callbacks for 
hwparams/free stream operations
[PATCH v2 13/14] soundwire: intel: free all resources on hw_free()

I suggested an approach that you didn't comment on, and now I am not 
sure what to make of the heated wording and exclamation marks. You did 
not answer to Liam's question on links between ASoC/SoundWire - despite 
the fact that drivers/soundwire cannot be an isolated subsystem, both 
the Intel and Qualcomm solutions have a big fat 'depends on SND_SOC'.

At this point I am formally asking for your view and guidance on how we 
are going to do the SoundWire/ASoC integration. It's now your time to 
make suggestions on what the flow should be between you and 
Mark/Takashi. If you don't want this initial change to the header files, 
then what is your proposal?
