That is all nice work :-)

There is no way to say what CR bits to return.  The ABI requires some of
those bits to be preserved, and some are volatile.  System calls use a
different ABI, one the compiler knows nothing about, so you cannot even
show system calls as calls to the compiler.

"Slight":

	With current powerpc/32 ASM VDSO:

	gettimeofday:    vdso: 750 nsec/call
	clock-getres-realtime:    vdso: 382 nsec/call
	clock-gettime-realtime:    vdso: 928 nsec/call
	clock-getres-monotonic:    vdso: 382 nsec/call
	clock-gettime-monotonic:    vdso: 1033 nsec/call

	Once switched to C implementation:

	gettimeofday:    vdso: 1533 nsec/call
	clock-getres-realtime:    vdso: 853 nsec/call
	clock-gettime-realtime:    vdso: 1570 nsec/call
	clock-getres-monotonic:    vdso: 835 nsec/call
	clock-gettime-monotonic:    vdso: 1605 nsec/call

This also needs measurements on more representative PowerPC cores, say
some G3 or G4; and on modern CPUs (Power7/8/9).

It also needs context with those measurements: what CPU core is it?
Running at what frequency clock?

On most PowerPC cores the time base is incremented significantly faster.
Usual speeds for older cores are 50MHz to 100MHz, and for newer cores ten
times that.  Recommended frequency is currently 512MHz, so you'll wrap the
low 32 bits in 8s or so on those, and in about a minute on many powermac
etc. machines already.  How can you know this long hasn't passed since the
last time you read the high half of the time base?  Without reading that
high part?

The current (assembler) code already optimises converting this to some
other scale quite well, better than a compiler can (see __do_get_tspec).
