The loop has cpu_relax() (as any spin loop should have), that implies a
compiler barrier() and should disallow the compiler from being funny.

That said; I feel it would be very good to mandate a comment with every
use of data_race(), just like we mandate a comment with memory barriers.
This comment can then explain why the data_race() annotation is correct.
