the flow with custom allocator is slightly different, but you are right
I can simplify it as you suggested.
Jonathan, I will add you to the cc list in next version. If you could
also review the current version, it would be greatly appreciated.

I am not sure we need to count on @set to decipher data type. Whoever
does the allocation and owns the IOASID should knows its own data type.
My thought was that @set is only used to group IDs, permission check
etc.

A global search use case can be for PRQ. IOMMU driver gets a IOASID
(first interrupt then retrieve from a queue), it has no idea which
@set it belongs to. But the data types are the same for all IOASIDs
used by the IOMMU.
If @set is NULL, the search does not check set match. It is separate
from return pointer. Sorry i am not seeing the problems here.
