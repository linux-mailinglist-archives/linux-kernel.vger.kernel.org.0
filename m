Agreed. I am planning to do an audit of this code within the next couple of
weeks so I will be on the look out for any optimization opportunities related
to this. Will let you know if this can work. For now I like your patch better
because it is more conservative and doesn't cause any space overhead.

If you'd like, please free to included my Tested-by on it:

Tested-by: Joel Fernandes (Google) <joel@joelfernandes.org>

If you had a chance, could you also point to me any tests that show
performance improvement with the irqwork patch, on the expedited GP usecase?
I'd like to try it out as well. I guess rcuperf should have some?

thanks!
