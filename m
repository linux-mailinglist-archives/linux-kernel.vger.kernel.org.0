Subject: [RFT PATCH v2 09/10] drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Kill cmd_cache and find_match() with fire

As talked about in the comments introduced by the patch ("drivers:
qcom: rpmh-rsc: A lot of comments"), the find_match() function()
didn't seem very sensible.  Remove it and the cmd_cache array that it
needed.

Nothing should stop us from exploring some fancy ways to avoid fully
invalidating the whole sleep/wake TCSs all the time in the future, but
find_match() doesn't seem well enough thought out to keep while we
wait for something better to arrive.

This patch isn't quite a no-op.  Specifically:

* It should be a slight performance boost of not searching through so
  many arrays.
* There is slightly less self-checking of commands written to the
  sleep/wake sets.  If it truly is an error to write to the same
  address more than once in a tcs_group then some cases (but not all)
  would have been caught before.

It's possible that this might need the latest version of Maulik's
rpmh.c patches to work properly so we can really be sure that we
always invalidate before we flush.

Changes in v2:
- Got rid of useless "if (x) continue" at end of for loop.

-/**
- * find_match() - Find if the cmd sequence is in the tcs_group
- * @tcs: The tcs_group to search.  Either sleep or wake.
- * @cmd: The command sequence to search for; only addr is looked at.
- * @len: The number of commands in the sequence.
- *
- * Searches through the given tcs_group to see if a given command sequence
- * is in there.
- *
- * Two sequences are matches if they modify the same set of addresses in
- * the same order.  The value of the data is not considered when deciding if
- * two things are matches.
- *
- * How this function works is best understood by example.  For our example,
- * we'll imagine our tcs group contains these (cmd, data) tuples:
- *   [(a, A), (b, B), (c, C), (d, D), (e, E), (f, F), (g, G), (h, H)]
- * ...in other words it has an element where (addr=a, data=A), etc.
- * ...we'll assume that there is one TCS in the group that can store 8 commands.
- *
- * - find_match([(a, X)]) => 0
- * - find_match([(c, X), (d, X)]) => 2
- * - find_match([(c, X), (d, X), (e, X)]) => 2
- * - find_match([(z, X)]) => -ENODATA
- * - find_match([(a, X), (y, X)]) => -EINVAL (and warning printed)
- * - find_match([(g, X), (h, X), (i, X)]) => -EINVAL (and warning printed)
- * - find_match([(y, X), (a, X)]) => -ENODATA
- *
- * NOTE: This function overall seems like it has questionable value.
- * - It can be used to update a message in the TCS with new data, but I
- *   don't believe we actually do that--we always fully invalidate and
- *   re-write everything.  Specifically it would be too limiting to force
- *   someone not to change the set of addresses written to each time.
- * - This function could be attempting to avoid writing different data to
- *   the same address twice in a tcs_group.  If that's the goal, it doesn't
- *   do a great job since find_match([(y, X), (a, X)]) return -ENODATA in my
- *   above example.
- * - If you originally wrote [(a, A), (b, B), (c, C)] and later tried to
- *   write [(a, A), (b, B)] it'd look like a match and we wouldn't consider
- *   it an error that the size got shorter.
- * - If two clients wrote sequences that happened to be placed in slots next
- *   to each other then a later check could match a sequence that was the
- *   size of both together.
- *
- * TODO: in light of the above, prehaps we can just remove this function?
- * If we later come up with fancy algorithms for updating everything without
- * full invalidations we can come up with something then.
- *
- * Only for use on sleep/wake TCSs since those are the only ones we maintain
- * tcs->slots and tcs->cmd_cache for.
- *
- * Must be called with the tcs_lock for the group held.
- *
- * Return: If the given command sequence wasn't in the tcs_group: -ENODATA.
- *         If the given command sequence was in the tcs_group: the index of
- *         the slot in the tcs_group where the first command is.
- *         In some error cases (see above), -EINVAL.
