Nice!

 so ideally I'd want the cursor to not blink. Is there some nice way to tel=
l the vt/console driver to do this by default?

Hm maybe there is something, but this is the first epaper driver, so I
guess even if it's exists already in fbcon, you'd need to wire through
a flag from drm to drm fbdev emulation to fbdev core to fbcon that
cursors should better not blink.

?

For kms, no. In general kms is supposed to be standardized and
generic, and uses properties. I think Emil already comment a bit with
pointers what you should look into instead for each part. For partial
updates we have the damage rectangle stuff now, but no idea whether
that's good enough for what you need.

> (3) I read that any drm driver has to be committed along with a libdrm im=
plementation. I think the most likely interface for anyone to interact with=
 this driver would be the fb dev. Do I have to make some userspace implemen=
tation as well anyway? If so, where would that go: libdrm or some sort of n=
ew libepaper?

Even more strict: we require full open source userspace, per
https://dri.freedesktop.org/docs/drm/gpu/drm-uapi.html#open-source-userspac=
e-requirements

But since kms is standardized you should be able to create a driver
for it with no new changes in userspace at all.

> (4) The driver accepts both XRGB8888 and RGB565 (for compatibility with s=
mall LCDs). The driver's current approach to calculate a b/w/r "ternary" im=
age from this data is to just take the MSBs of each color component, then m=
ake anything red (R>127, G,B<=3D127) red, anything black (R,G,B each <=3D12=
7) black and anything else white. This is since the display's default state=
 is white, and a pixel can turn either red or black from that. Note that it=
's the actual pixel changing color, i.e. there is no black and red sub-pixe=
ls. If you try to drive black and red at the same time, the chip just selec=
ts red for that pixel. What are your thoughts on this interface? I was thin=
king about using some indexed color mode, but that would limit possible fut=
ure grayscale support[7].

Hm generally we're trying not to fake stuff in the kernel driver in
drm. XRGB8888 is an exception because too much stuff blindly assumes
it exists. I think what we want here is an epaper drm_fourcc.h code,
at least long-term. But since that's new userspace api it also means
we need some open source userspace to drive it. I think best approach
would be to get the basic driver with XRGB8888 emulation merged first,
and then figure out how to best add the specific epaper formats to
fully expose the underlying capabilities.

o please be gentle but please do point out all my mistakes :) I'm aware the=
 dt binding doc is still lacking.

So the great and also somewhat tricky bit is that support code for
tiny drivers is evolving really quick, so would be good if you can
rebase onto drm-misc-next from
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/ There's still tons
in-flight, but that should at least help. One notable series that
didn't land yet renames tindydrm to drm/tiny/, so maybe wait for that
to land (it hopefully should land soon I think).
