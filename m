Similarly if we could take data for the enclave from fd and enforce
it with sgx_enclave_t label.

With the fd based model for source I'd mark SECINFO.W pages as unsafe
to execute and then check unsafe bit before applying lets say EMODT
or EMODPR.

There is a problem here though. Usually the enclave itself is just a
loader that then loads the application from outside source and creates
the executable pages from the content.

A great example of this is Graphene that bootstraps unmodified Linux
applications to an enclave:
