The semantics for yield_task under CFS are not well-defined.  With our
CFS hierarchy, we cannot easily just push a yielded task to the end of
a runqueue.  And, we don't want to play games with artificially
increasing vruntime, as this results in potentially high latency for a
yielded task to get back on CPU.

I'd interpret a task that calls yield as saying "I can run, but try to
run something else."  I'd agree that this patch is imperfect in
achieving this, but I think it is better than the current
implementation (or at least, less broken).  Currently, a side-effect
of calling yield is that all other tasks in the same hierarchy get
skipped as well.  This is almost certainly not what the user
expects/wants.  It is true that if a yielded task has no other tasks
in its cgroup on the same CPU, we will potentially end up just picking
the yielded task again.  But this should be OK; a yielded task should
be able to continue making forward progress.  Any yielded task that
calls yield again is likely implementing a busy loop, which is an
improper use of yield anyway.

I also played around with the idea of setting the skip buddy up the
hierarchy up to the point where cfs_rq->nr_running > 1, but this is
racy with enqueue, and in general raises questions about whether an
enqueued task should try to clear skip buddies.
