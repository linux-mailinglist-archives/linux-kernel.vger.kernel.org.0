I did propose that same idea here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/fd7d6101-37f4-2d34-f2f7-cfeade610278@huawei.com/

And that fits my agenda to get best throughput figures, while not 
possibly affecting others.

But it seems that we could do better to make this a common policy: allow 
the threaded part to roam when that CPU is overloaded, but how...?

Understood. My data is that we get an ~11% throughput boost for our 
storage test with this change.

Thanks,
