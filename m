I am not seeing a whole lot of benefit in doing this in lib.mk
Test authors have to think about which files to include in
TEST_FILES and add it to Makefile anyway.

My second reason is I would like authors to think about the settings
as opposed to just duplicate from another test. This timeout changes
the kselftest run-time and behavior.

I am also finding making features generic has downsides to it unless
we are smart about it. We have several overrides already for things
that made perfect sense to make generic.

Thanks for the patch though. We can consider adding it a later time, if
we see value in making this generic.

thanks,
