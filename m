Fair enough.  I can start with a fault_signal_pending() only keeps the
sigkill handling just like before, then convert all the archs, with
the last patch to only touch fault_signal_pending() for non-fatal
signals.

Hmm sure.  These sound very reasonable.

I must admit that I am not brave enough to continue grow my patchset
on my own.  The condition I'm facing right now is that I can't really
find enough reviewers for this series (Linus helped me quite a lot, I
really, really, appreciated that), while it's still growing.  I hope
the started discussion means that you'll be at least another potential
reviewer (oh, should I count Kirill in as well? :) at least to the
coming patches for the things mentioned above.

Thanks,
