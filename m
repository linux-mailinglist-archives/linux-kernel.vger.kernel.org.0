Sorry you are late, we've already done that, it should be merged via Greg's char-misc tree.

> +====================================
> +
> +Introduction
> +============
> +
> +The Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) is an isolated and protected
> +computing resource (Co-processor) residing inside certain Intel
> +chipsets. The Intel ME provides support for computer/IT management
> +features. The feature set depends on the Intel chipset SKU.
> +
> +The Intel Management Engine Interface (Intel MEI, previously known as
> +HECI) is the interface between the Host and Intel ME. This interface is
> +exposed to the host as a PCI device. The Intel MEI Driver is in charge
> +of the communication channel between a host application and the Intel ME
> feature.
> +
> +Each Intel ME feature (Intel ME Client) is addressed by a GUID/UUID and
> +each client has its own protocol. The protocol is message-based with a
> +header and payload up to 512 bytes.
> +
> +Prominent usage of the Intel ME Interface is to communicate with
> +Intel(R) Active Management Technology (Intel AMT) implemented in
> +firmware running on the Intel ME.
> +
> +Intel AMT provides the ability to manage a host remotely out-of-band
> +(OOB) even when the operating system running on the host processor has
> +crashed or is in a sleep state.
> +
> +Some examples of Intel AMT usage are:
> +        * Monitoring hardware state and platform components
> +        * Remote power off/on (useful for green computing or overnight IT
> +          maintenance)
> +        * OS updates
> +        * Storage of useful platform information such as software assets
> +        * Built-in hardware KVM
> +        * Selective network isolation of Ethernet and IP protocol flows based
> +          on policies set by a remote management console
> +        * IDE device redirection from remote management console
> +
> +Intel AMT (OOB) communication is based on SOAP (deprecated starting
> +with Release 6.0) over HTTP/S or WS-Management protocol over HTTP/S
> +that are received from a remote management console application.
> +
> +For more information about Intel AMT:
> +`<http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_
> +Reference_Guide>`_
> +
> +
> +Intel MEI Driver
> +================
> +
> +The driver exposes a misc device called :file:`/dev/mei`.
> +
> +An application maintains communication with an Intel ME feature while
> +:file:`/dev/mei` is open. The binding to a specific feature is
> +performed by calling :c:macro:`IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT`, which passes
> the desired UUID.
> +The number of instances of an Intel ME feature that can be opened at
> +the same time depends on the Intel ME feature, but most of the features
> +allow only a single instance.
> +
> +The Intel AMT Host Interface (Intel AMTHI) feature supports multiple
> +simultaneous user connected applications. The Intel MEI driver handles
> +this internally by maintaining request queues for the applications.
> +
> +The driver is transparent to data that are passed between firmware
> +feature and host application.
> +
> +Because some of the Intel ME features can change the system
> +configuration, the driver by default allows only a privileged user to
> +access it.
> +
> +A code snippet for an application communicating with Intel AMTHI client:
> +
> +::
> +
> +        struct mei_connect_client_data data;
> +        fd = open(MEI_DEVICE);
> +
> +        data.d.in_client_uuid = AMTHI_UUID;
> +
> +        ioctl(fd, IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT, &data);
> +
> +        printf("Ver=%d, MaxLen=%ld\n",
> +               data.d.in_client_uuid.protocol_version,
> +               data.d.in_client_uuid.max_msg_length);

> +Intel AMT OS Health Watchdog
> +============================
> +
> +The Intel AMT Watchdog is an OS Health (Hang/Crash) watchdog.

> +
> +The Intel AMT Watchdog is composed of two parts:
> +        1) Firmware feature - receives the heartbeats
> +           and sends an event when the heartbeats stop.
> +        2) Intel MEI iAMT watchdog driver - connects to the watchdog feature,
> +           configures the watchdog and sends the heartbeats.
> +
> +The Intel iAMT watchdog MEI driver uses the kernel watchdog API to
> +configure the Intel AMT Watchdog and to send heartbeats to it. The
> +default timeout of the watchdog is 120 seconds.
> +
> +If the Intel AMT is not enabled in the firmware then the watchdog
> +client won't enumerate on the me client bus and watchdog devices won't be
> exposed.

> -Intel(R) Management Engine Interface (Intel(R) MEI) -
> ===================================================
> -
> -Introduction
> -============
> -
> -The Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) is an isolated and protected
> computing -resource (Co-processor) residing inside certain Intel chipsets. The
> Intel ME -provides support for computer/IT management features. The feature
> set -depends on the Intel chipset SKU.
> -
> -The Intel Management Engine Interface (Intel MEI, previously known as HECI)
> -is the interface between the Host and Intel ME. This interface is exposed -to
> the host as a PCI device. The Intel MEI Driver is in charge of the -
> communication channel between a host application and the Intel ME feature.
> -
> -Each Intel ME feature (Intel ME Client) is addressed by a GUID/UUID and -each
> client has its own protocol. The protocol is message-based with a -header and
> payload up to 512 bytes.
> -
> -Prominent usage of the Intel ME Interface is to communicate with Intel(R) -
> Active Management Technology (Intel AMT) implemented in firmware running
> on -the Intel ME.
> -
> -Intel AMT provides the ability to manage a host remotely out-of-band (OOB) -
> even when the operating system running on the host processor has crashed or -
> is in a sleep state.
> -
> -Some examples of Intel AMT usage are:
> -   - Monitoring hardware state and platform components
> -   - Remote power off/on (useful for green computing or overnight IT
> -     maintenance)
> -   - OS updates
> -   - Storage of useful platform information such as software assets
> -   - Built-in hardware KVM
> -   - Selective network isolation of Ethernet and IP protocol flows based
> -     on policies set by a remote management console
> -   - IDE device redirection from remote management console
> -
> -Intel AMT (OOB) communication is based on SOAP (deprecated -starting with
> Release 6.0) over HTTP/S or WS-Management protocol over -HTTP/S that are
> received from a remote management console application.

> -Intel MEI Driver
> -================
> -
> -The driver exposes a misc device called /dev/mei.
> -
> -An application maintains communication with an Intel ME feature while -
> /dev/mei is open. The binding to a specific feature is performed by calling -
> MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT_IOCTL, which passes the desired UUID.
> -The number of instances of an Intel ME feature that can be opened -at the
> same time depends on the Intel ME feature, but most of the -features allow
> only a single instance.
> -
> -The Intel AMT Host Interface (Intel AMTHI) feature supports multiple -
> simultaneous user connected applications. The Intel MEI driver -handles this
> internally by maintaining request queues for the applications.
> -
> -The driver is transparent to data that are passed between firmware feature -
> and host application.
> -
> -Because some of the Intel ME features can change the system -configuration,
> the driver by default allows only a privileged -user to access it.
> -
> -A code snippet for an application communicating with Intel AMTHI client:
> -
> -	struct mei_connect_client_data data;
> -	fd = open(MEI_DEVICE);
> -
> -	data.d.in_client_uuid = AMTHI_UUID;
> -
> -	ioctl(fd, IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT, &data);
> -
> -	printf("Ver=%d, MaxLen=%ld\n",
> -			data.d.in_client_uuid.protocol_version,
> -			data.d.in_client_uuid.max_msg_length);
> -
> -	[...]
> -
> -	write(fd, amthi_req_data, amthi_req_data_len);
> -
