Not outside our lab, but OpenCAPI attached LPC memory is assigned
addresses based on the slot/NPU it is connected to. These addresses
prior to:
4ffe713b7587 ("powerpc/mm: Increase the max addressable memory to 2PB")
were inaccessible and resulted in bogus sections - see our discussion
on 'mm: Trigger bug on if a section is not found in __section_nr'.
Doing this check here was your suggestion :)

It's entirely possible that a similar problem will occur in the future,
and it's cheap to guard against, which is why I've added this.
