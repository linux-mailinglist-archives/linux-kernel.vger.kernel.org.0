This is the hardest problem in computer science. Figuring out a name.
;-)

Maybe call it scm_buffer_*? Because it _is_ scm communication with
shared buffers? The newer calling convention passes arguments in
registers, but the original calling convention passed a buffer around
from non-secure to secure world and then back again and had a embryonic
register based calling convention. That buffer passing still sort of
happens with the new style but it isn't done unless the register count
is larger than 5 or so and the return buffer isn't unbounded in size
like it was done. It also sort of follows the ARM SMC Calling Convection
spec now.
