There is indeed additional information we are getting by iterating
directly on the data structures and emitting tracepoints from within the
kernel which is lost when we copy the data to user-space: the time-stamp
at which the data is observed.

Please note that the statedump approach is applied not only to block
devices, but also to namespaces, thread scheduling, process memory
mappings, file descriptor tables, interrupt handlers, network
interfaces, and cpu topology. Those are more or less long running states
which can change dynamically while a trace is being recorded. Our trace 
post-processing tools model the overall kernel state over time by
reconciling tracepoints tracking all state changes (e.g.
insertions/removals) with the statedump information. The time-stamps
available for both state-change events and statedump events is what
allow us to do this modeling.

In the case of block/genhd.c, we care about the mapping between the
device number and the disk name, which is something which can be changed
dynamically, and is thus valid for a given time-range in the trace.

What we are trying to ensure is to gather all the relevant information
to allow trace analyses to re-create a precise model of the kernel
through time. In the case of genhd, that would be tuples of mapping
between device number and name, which are valid for given time-ranges.

These are recorded by the "lttng_statedump_block_device" event, which
has a timestamp generated by the LTTng tracer, along with the
(device_nr, disk_name) event payload. You will notice from what I stated 
above that we are missing information about disks being 
registered/unregistered later in the trace. Ideally, we would also like
to add tracepoints into register_disk() and del_gendisk() (or more
relevant functions nearby) to trace those state changes. We have those
state-change tracking tracepoints in other subsystems, but unfortunately
not in the block layer.

This information is then used at post-processing to augment the block
events (see include/trace/block.h) to convert the device numbers to
human-readable strings. It is also used to provide human-readable
rows, columns and graph labels when presenting block I/O state over
time, and aggregated summary, on a per disk basis.

If we would instead go through sysfs to export this block device
information, we end up copying the relevant information to user-space,
and only then write the data into a trace buffer. There ends up being a
delay between the point at which the state is observed within the kernel
and the sampling of the time-stamp describing when it occurs, which
introduces many interesting race scenarios where disk
registration/unregistration happens in parallel with a statedump and
block device activity emitting tracepoints into the trace. We lose the
ability to provide a reliable time-range for which the mapping between
(device_nr, disk_name) is valid. Going through uevent also lacks
time-stamp consistency with the block tracepoint events.

Thanks,

Mathieu
