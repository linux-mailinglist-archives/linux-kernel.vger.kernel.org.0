DSI0 to "ti,sn65dsi86" (bridge) to "sharp,ld-d5116z01b" (panel).

Panel was infact NULL for me, and the DSI panel operations are not
translating into direct bridge calls.  I re-applied your change, and
I'm not reproing the original failure.  I tried a couple of times to
be sure.  I have no idea what happened during the initial testing to
break things.

Therefore, I remove my nack.
