Hmm.

So my tooling is "git am", nothing special.

All of the afflicted files arrived in that state as the result of a pair
of patches from Jonathan (copied); I have verified that the original
patches also had the DOS line endings.

The problem repeats if I apply those patches now, even if I add an
explicit "--no-keep-cr" to the "git am" command line.  It seems like maybe
my version of git is somehow broken?  I have git-2.21.0-1.fc30.x86_64,
FWIW.

Anyway, if I revert the two offending patches and resend the pull, is that
good enough, or do you want this mess out of the history entirely?

Sorry for the trouble,

jon
