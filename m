Horrible naming scheme for this new "flag".

Look at that call here, can you instantly tell what this call is doing
with "0"?  I sure can not :(

If you really want to do this, you make a different function,
tty_init_dev_retry() and then have that pass in a retry flag in the tty
core, so that any users always know what they are doing here.

But, this really feels like a race in the code somewhere:

Why would tty->port not be set up already?  The caller has control over
this, what is not happening correctly to cause this?
