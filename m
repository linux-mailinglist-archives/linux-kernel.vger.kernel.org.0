But KVM on arm64 is pretty intertwined with the rest of the kernel, and
things like the arch timers, for example, really depend on the exact
semantics of how the rest of the kernel changes.  I fear that you'd end
up back-porting patches that depend on changes to irqchip and timers in
the core code, and you'll get even more oddly-defined behavior in the
wild.

How would you manage that, and how would the end result be a more stable
environment than what you have today?

Also, I'm curious if you expect to find more bugs in the hypervisor
itself than in the rest of the kernel, because it's only in the former
case you can avoid a reboot of the host, and all things considered this
would appear to only help in a small fraction of the cases where you
have to patch things?
