One point that might be more useful first would be, is a revert of:

commit b059f801a937 ("x86/purgatory: Use CFLAGS_REMOVE rather than
reset KBUILD_CFLAGS")

good enough, or must:

commit 4ce97317f41d ("x86/purgatory: Do not use __builtin_memcpy and
__builtin_memset")

be reverted additionally?  They were part of a 2 patch patchset.  I
would prefer tglx to revert as few patches as necessary if possible
(to avoid "revert of revert" soup), and I doubt the latter patch needs
to be reverted.  (Even more preferential would be a fix, with no
reverts, but whichever).
