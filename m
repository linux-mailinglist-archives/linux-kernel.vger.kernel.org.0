ok. I don't think Intel folks have this device available, or it's used 
for other things, but if you want to bisect on you may want to use [1] 
to solve DRM issues. I used it to make Broadwell/Samus work again with SOF.

An alternate path would be to switch to SOF. It's still viewed as a 
developer option but Broadwell/Samus work reliably for me and we have a 
Broadwell-rt286 platform used for CI.
