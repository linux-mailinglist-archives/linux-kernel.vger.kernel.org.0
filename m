It will solve RxD case, due to mctrl doesn't count RxD as a "control" line.

Though we have CTS pin defined for the same purpose, which means the hardware
flow control won't work on a subset of Broxton boards.

I understand that. At the same time it should not break existing systems.

As I said already we have to distinguish *the purpose* of these GPIOs.
(like CTS).

Can we apply this if and only if the device has no ACPI companion device?

In this case DT will work as you expect and ACPI won't be broken.
