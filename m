Sorry, it does still exist, just been moved around a bit.

See lib/inflate.c:

STATIC int INIT inflate(void)
{
...
#ifdef ARCH_HAS_DECOMP_WDOG
    arch_decomp_wdog();
#endif

Given that it still exists, maybe this hook name should be used for
this same issue in the LZ4 code?

Well, we'll see whether the arm-soc people have anything to add...
