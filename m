The caller is responsible for ensuring EREMOVE can be safely executed,
e.g. by holding the enclave's lock.

For many ENCLS leafs, EREMOVE included, the CPU requires exclusive access
to the SGX Enclave Control Structures (SECS)[*] and will signal a #GP if
a different logical CPU is already executing an ENCLS leaf that requires
exclusive SECS access.  The SGX subsystem uses a per-enclave mutex to
serialize such ENCLS leafs, among other things.

[*] The SECS is a per-enclave page that resides in the EPC and can only be
    directly accessed by the CPU.  It's used to track metadata about the
    enclave, e.g. number of child pages, base, size, etc...

It was deliberately left as a WARN as having multiple stack traces has
been very helpful for triaging and debugging software bugs.  I agree that
it can and should be changed to a WARN_ONCE() for upstream.

As for why it exists at all, the WARN will only fire if there is a kernel
and/or CPU bug.  In the vast majority of cases, EREMOVE is guaranteed to
be successful (assuming no bugs).  In those situations, if EREMOVE fails
there really isn't a sane option other to WARN and leak the page, e.g.
the kernel can't override the CPUs protection to forcefully EREMOVE the
page.

The non-warn variant, __sgx_free_page(), is provided for the (currently)
one case where EREMOVE failure is expected/tolerable (opportunstically
freeing EPC pages when the enclave is killed).
