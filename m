I would just ignore the overflow. We would just start measuring
the timeout in the next check_hung_task() call. It is not
a big deal and removes few lines of a tricky code.

In this case, the watchdog should get enabled on with
CONFIG_DEBUG_AID_FOR_SYZBOT

Also we should ask/inform Stephen about this. I am not sure
if he is willing to resolve eventual conflicts for these
syzboot-specific patches that are not upstream candidates.

A solution might be to create sysbot-specific for-next branch
that Stephen might simply ignore when there are conflicts.
And you would be responsible for updating it.
