Would you mean "in_kprobe" flag will prevent recursive execution of
kprobes but not prevent other tracer like tracepoint? If so, it is
already done I think. As I pointed, kprobe itself has in_kprobe like
flag for checking re-entrance. Thus the kprobe handler can call the
function which has a tracepoint safely.

Anyway, I agree with you to port all kprobe int3/debug handling parts
to the effect-less (offlimit) area, except for its pre/post handlers.

Yeah, I hope so. The bust_kprobes() is something like an emergency escape
hammer which everyone hopes never be used :)
