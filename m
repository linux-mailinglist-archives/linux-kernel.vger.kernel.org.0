Sorry for confusing. The so called 'gap' is a time window between 
free_irq() and request_irq().

For example, interrupt affinity setting in a VM (with VFIO passthrough 
device) will trigger VFIO to

do free-then-setup interrupt as below. After free_irq(), the target IRTE 
is invalidated, an in-flight

interrupt (buffering in hardware layer which cannot be synchronized in 
software) may cause a

DMAR fault before IRTE being setup again with exactly the same value as 
this entry was before cleared

By using a new function who only updates devid, this gap can actually be 
closed since

this new function won't modify irte.

When posted interrupt is in use, the target IRTE does need to be 
modified because this IRTE

will be used by IOMMU to find the target CPU since hypervisor is 
bypassed. That is also the

reason why still call irq_bypass_register_producer() although the token 
of producer has not

been changed. irq_bypass_register_producer() will modify irte if posted 
interrupt is in use:

ok, will name it to irq_update_devid() in next version.

Thanks to point it out, I will change to the following in next version, 
is that ok?

...
