I think the suggestion is to maintain a nr_free count of the free_list for 
each order for each migratetype so anytime a page is added or deleted from 
the list, the nr_free is adjusted.  Then the free_area's nr_free becomes 
the sum of its migratetype's nr_free at that order.  That's possible to do 
if you track the migratetype per page, as you said, or like pcp pages 
track it as part of page->index.  It's a trade-off on whether you want to 
impact the performance of maintaining these new nr_frees anytime you 
manipulate the freelists.

I think Vlastimil and I discussed per order per migratetype nr_frees in 
the past and it could be a worthwhile improvement for other reasons, 
specifically it leads to heuristics that can be used to determine how 
fragmentated a certain migratetype is for a zone, i.e. a very quick way to 
determine what ratio of pages over all MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE pageblocks are 
free.

Or maybe there are other reasons why these nr_frees can't be maintained 
anymore?  (I had a patch to do it on 4.3.)

You may also find systems where MIGRATE_MOVABLE is not actually the 
longest free_list compared to other migratetypes on a severely fragmented 
system, so special casing MIGRATE_MOVABLE might not be the best way 
forward.
