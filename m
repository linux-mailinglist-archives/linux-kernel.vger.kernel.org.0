Thanks.

All arch_scale_FOO() functions follow the approach to force the arch
(currently x86, arm, arm64) to do

#define arch_scale_FOO BAR

to enable the FOO functionality.

There is no direct link between consumer and provider here.

 consumer (sched) -> arch <- provider (arch, counters, CPUfreq, CPU
                                       cooling, etc.)

So IMHO, FOO=thermal_pressure should follow this design pattern too.

'thermal_pressure' would be the only one which can be disabled by a
kernel config switch at the consumer side.
IMHO, it doesn't make sense to have the provider operating in this case.

You might see thermal_pressure more on the level of irq_load or
[rt/dl]_rq_load and that could be why we have a different opinion here?

Now rt_rq_load and dl_rq_load are scheduler internal providers and
irq_load is driven by 'irq_delta + steal' time (which is much closer to
the scheduler than thermal for instance).

My assumption is that we don't want a direct link between the scheduler
and e.g. a provider 'thermal'.
