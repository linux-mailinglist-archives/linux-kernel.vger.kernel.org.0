Many (most?) bugzilla.kernel.org components result in e-mail getting
sent to vger.kernel.org mailing lists.  So even if they delete the
bugzilla account, there e-mail will be immortalized in lore.kernel.org
and their associated git repositories.

So perhaps a better approach is to put a warning alerting bug
reporters that submitting a bug means their e-mail will end up get
broadcasting in public mailing list archives and public git
repositories?

I assume distro engineers who are fixing bugs from their Distro
bugzillas which support non-public bugs already know that they
shouldn't be revealing their customers' identities.  But
realistically, while I agree it would be nice to ask people if they
don't mind being immortalized in git repositories, we should probably
warn people that when they submit a bug, or for that matter, send
e-mail to a kernel mailing list, they're going to be immortalized in a
git repository *already*.
