When unloading the bochs-drm driver, a warning message is printed by
drm_mode_config_cleanup() because a reference is still held to one of
the drm_connector structs.

Correct this by calling drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() in
bochs_pci_remove().

The issue is caused by the interaction of two previous commits. Both
together are required to cause it:
Fixes: 846c7dfc1193 ("drm/atomic: Try to preserve the crtc enabled state in drm_atomic_remove_fb, v2.")
Fixes: 6579c39594ae ("drm/bochs: atomic: switch planes to atomic, wire up helpers.")

Hello,

This seems to be similar to an issue I recently fixed for the AST driver:
1e613f3c630c ("drm/ast: Fix connector leak during driver unload")
Which is similar to at least one other recent fix:
192b4af6cd28 ("drm/tegra: Shutdown on driver unbind")

The fix seems to be the same, but this time I've tried to dig a little deeper
and use an appropriate Fixes tag to assist backporting.

Bisecting the issue for commits to drivers/gpu/drm/bochs/ points to:
6579c39594ae ("drm/bochs: atomic: switch planes to atomic, wire up helpers.")
... but the issue also seems to be due to a change in the generic drm code
(reverting it separately fixes the issue):
846c7dfc1193 ("drm/atomic: Try to preserve the crtc enabled state in drm_atomic_remove_fb, v2.")
... so I've included both in the commit.  Is that the right thing to do?

I couldn't help wondering if we should also update the comment for
drm_fbdev_generic_setup(), because it says:
"The fbdev is destroyed by drm_dev_unregister()"
... which implies to me that cleanup only requires that call, but actually
since 846c7dfc1193 you will always(?) need to use drm_atomic_helper_shutdown()
as well. (Is it actually always the case?)

Cheers,
Sam.
