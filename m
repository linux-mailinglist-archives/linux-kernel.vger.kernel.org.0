Hello Kees!

It's a pleasure to hear from you!

No I did not actually hit the double-free. I'm just following
the indicators from static analyzer.

I have noticed that. Thanks for clearing it up though.

The `kfree` I was referring to is in `err:` label of function
`persistent_ram_new` in `ram_core.c#595` of `for-next/pstore` tree:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kees/linux.git/tree/fs/pstore/ram_core.c?h=for-next/pstore#n595

Here are the relevant bits:

```
struct persistent_ram_zone *persistent_ram_new(phys_addr_t start, size_t 
size,
			u32 sig, struct persistent_ram_ecc_info *ecc_info,
			unsigned int memtype, u32 flags, char *label)
{
	/* ... */
	/* ... */
	/* ... */
	return prz;
err:
	persistent_ram_free(prz); /* <----- */
	return ERR_PTR(ret);
}
```

So, to my understanding, if our `persistent_ram_new` call in `ram.c#583`
fails, it already does clean up the `label` pointer in itself and 
returns
an ERR_PTR back to us and our skipping logic does its job.

I might be missing something but it seems so.

Thank you for looking into this.
