Yeah, the compete-with-FORTRAN stuff.  :-/

There is some work going on in the C committee on this, where the
theorists would like to restrict strict-alias based optimizations to
enable better analysis tooling.  And no, although the theorists are
pushing in the direction we would like them to, as far as I can see
they are not pushing as far as we would like.  But it might be that
-fno-strict-aliasing needs some upgrades as well.  I expect to learn
more at the next meeting in a few months.

I was hoping that -fno-strict-overflow might go into the C++ (not C)
standard, and even thought that it had at one point, but what went into
the standard was that signed integers are twos complement, not that
overflowing them is well defined.

We are pushing to hopefully end but at least to restrict the current
pointer lifetime-end zap behavior in both C and C++, which is similar
to the pointer provenance/alias analysis that -fno-strict-aliasing at
least partially suppresses.  The zapping invalidates loading, storing,
comparing, or doing arithmetic on a pointer to an object whose lifetime
has ended.  (The WG14 PDF linked to below gives a non-exhaustive list
of problems that this causes.)

The Linux kernel used to avoid this by refusing to tell the compiler about
kmalloc() and friends, but that changed a few years ago.  This zapping
rules out a non-trivial class of concurrent algorithms, but for once
RCU is unaffected.  Some committee members complained that zapping has
been part of the standard since about 1990, but Maged Michael found a
writeup of one of the algorithms dating back to 1973.  ;-)

It would also be nice to downgrade some of the undefined behavior in
the standard itself.  Compiler writers usually hate this because it
would require them to document what their compiler does in each case.
So they would prefer "unspecified" if the could not have "undefined".

Me, I would still want to use WRITE_ONCE() in this case.

Though each of those compiler-generated multiple reads might return a
different value, right?
