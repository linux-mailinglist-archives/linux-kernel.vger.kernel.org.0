I meant kernel, but SGX_IOC_ADD_ENCLAVE_PAGE could be that API.

The only benefit I can see to making the kernel API take an fd instead
of a pointer is that it allows loading an enclave without mapping it
first, but that seems unlikely to be very important.

True, but in 2a it can be scanned even without understanding the
format.  That's probably not terribly important.

They're not orthogonal in the sense that verifying the SIGSTRUCT
implicitly verifies the executable contents.

will be enforced by SGX hardware.

I agree with you except that there's a difference in how the
configuration works.  If the whole .sigstruct is in a file, then
teaching your policy to accept an enclave works just like teaching
your policy to accept a new ELF program -- you just put it in a file
and mark the file trusted (by labeling it, for example).  If the
.sigstruct comes from unverifiable application memory, then an
out-of-band mechanism will likely be needed.

I'm okay with this if the consensus is that having a .sigstruct file
is too annoying.

(Note that a .sigstruct file does not, strictly speaking, require that
it comes from a real file.  It could come from memfd, and it will then
fail to load if the LSM doesn't like it.  So you can still easily
download and run an enclave if you think that's a good idea.)
