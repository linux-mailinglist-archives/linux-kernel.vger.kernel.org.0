Sure. I am up for a further redesign / simplification. I will think more
about your suggestions and can also further discuss at LPC.

And this patch is on LKML archives and is not going anywhere so there's no
rush I guess ;-)

The only other patch in this series is to repurpose the dyntick_nesting
counter to do the job of the dynticks_nmi_nesting counter. Did you mean that
one? Or did you mean the dntick tracing patch? I think I should indeed submit
the tracing patch separately.
