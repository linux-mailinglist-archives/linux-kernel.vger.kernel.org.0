A RTS glitch and data being dropped during the port reconfiguration is a
possiblity. However, with the delay the data that otherwise would cause
the frame reassembly error is received during the delay and discarded
(I don't recall what exactly leads to discarding), but we still receive
the vendor event we are waiting for (to drop it). This strongly suggests
that the data received during the delay is not the vendor event, but
something else. My first guess would be garbage as artifact of the
baudrate switch and/or pin config. My second guess would be an additional
HCI event, but I don't recall having seen that when I investigated the
problem with changing the baudrate on cheza.

Thanks for trying, I'm still wondering if some tweaking is needed, but
apparently just matching cheza/sdm845 doesn't work.
