True, yet my observation was that elf2flt utility assumes that address
space cannot exceed 32-bit (for header and absolute relocations). So,
from my limited point of view straightforward way to guarantee that would
be to build incoming elf in 32-bit mode (it is why I mentioned COMPAT/ILP32).

Also one of your patches expressed somewhat related idea

"binfmt_flat isn't the right binary format for huge executables to
start with"

Since you said there is no support for compat/ilp32, probably I'm missing some
toolchain magic?

Cheers
