The Real-Time Summit is organized by the Linux Foundation Real-Time Linux (RTL)
collaborative project. The event is intended to gather developers and users of
Linux as a Real-Time Operating System. The main intent is to provide room for
discussion between developers, tooling experts, and users.

The summit will take place alongside the Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux
Conference Europe 2019 in Lyon, France. The summit is planned the day after the
main conference, Thursday, October 31st, 2019, from 8:00 to 17:00 at the
conference venue. If you are already considering your travel arrangements for
the Open Source Summit + Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2019 in Lyon, France,
and you have a general interest in this topic, please extend your travel by one
day to be in Lyon on Thursday, 31st.

If you are interested to present, please submit a proposal [1] before September
14th, 2019, at 23:59 EST. Please provide a title, an abstract describing the
proposed talk (900 characters maximum), a short biography (900 characters
maximum), and describe the targeted audience (900 characters maximum). Please
indicate the slot length you are aiming for: The format is a single track with
presentation slots of 30, 45 or 60 minutes long. Considering that the
presentation should use at most half of the slot time, leaving the rest of the
slot reserved for discussion. The focus of this event is the discussion.

We are welcoming presentations from both end-users and developers, on topics
covering, but not limited to:

 - Real-time Linux development
 - Real-time Linux evaluation
 - Real-time Linux use cases (Success and failures)
 - Real-time Linux tooling (tracing, configuration, …)
 - Real-time Linux academic work, already presented or under development, for
   direct feedback from practitioners community.

Those can cover recently available technologies, ongoing work, and new ideas.

Important Notes for Speakers:

 - All speakers are required to adhere to the Linux Foundation events’ Code of
   Conduct. We also highly recommend that speakers take the Linux Foundation
   online Inclusive Speaker Orientation Course.

 - Avoid sales or marketing pitches and discussing unlicensed or potentially
   closed-source technologies when preparing your proposal; these talks are
   almost always rejected due to the fact that they take away from the integrity
   of our events, and are rarely well-received by conference attendees.

 - All accepted speakers are required to submit their slides prior to the
    event.

Submission must be received by 11:59 pm PST on September 14th, 2019
