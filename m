While I would tend to agree, I'm also wary of standardizing on
something which isn't what x86 does today :-)

You know what happens when we break them... interestingly enough they
(like quite a few other drivers) don't even bother trying to mask at
the APIC level unless I misread the code. That means that for endpoints
that don't support masking, they just get those MSIs and
"ignore" them...

But I'll look into it, see what the patch looks like.

I've also looked at trying to make the "inner domain" more generic but
that's looking a tad trickier... not giving up yet though :-)

Cheers,
Ben.
