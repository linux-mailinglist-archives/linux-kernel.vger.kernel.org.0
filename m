The DT bindings are here :

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/arm-dsu-pmu.txt

The concern here is that we are simply trying to replicate the DT
binding here, especially replacing the CPU phandles with MPIDRs.
I am not an expert in the ACPI bindings, but I prefer ACPI
phandle reference to the CPUs (which is much simpler) to
MPIDRs (which is not that intuitive). And this is the same message
that I got from our ACPI folks.

Irrespective of what we end up with, this must be part of the "ACPI 
bindings" document here :

DEN0093 - Generic ACPI for Arm Components x.y Platform Design Document

So that everybody uses the same bindings irrespective of the OS.
You don't need to document the bindings here with the Linux kernel code.


Kind regards
Suzuki
