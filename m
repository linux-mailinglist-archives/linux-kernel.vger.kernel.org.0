Ah, I checked git history, didn't find why it's added. I just Have a
superficial knowledge of the clearing, but in a low-efficiency way.

I see.

It's not added in one time. I am fine with your current change, would be
much better if mention it in log, and also add code comment above the
clearing code. Surely reverting and trying later with more comprehensive
solution is also good to me, this need a little more effort.
