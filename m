The HWMON API I pointed you to is a way for _any_ driver to implement
the necessary bits and pieces to report temperatures, alarms, etc.

It is _not_ restricted to modules under drivers/hwmon/ - you can
implement all parts of the HWMON interface from any driver anywhere.

Which means that all that is required to report alarms is to simply
implement support for that particular type of file.

Yes, but you don't define a cooling device, so there's nothing to
react to those notifications.

Other devices using the thermal zone subsystem implement both "sides"
of the zone: a sensor that monitors the device and cooling device(s)
which should be able to react to that. E.g. lowering the clock speed
of a CPU, slowing the transmission speed of a WiFi card, etc.

Your implementation doesn't do that.
