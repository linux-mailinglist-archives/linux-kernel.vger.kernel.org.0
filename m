sdm835 is the first implementation of the 10nm PLL.  Pretty much
everything after (including sdm845/850) also uses the 10nm PLL.

There is a suspend/resume sequence in the HPG where VCO isn't lost,
but that assumes the GDSC isn't turned off.  If GDSC is turned off,
then we need to go through the entire power-up sequence again.  Feels
like this should be plumbed into runtime PM based on the
suspend/resume usecase, but that's probably more complicated then this
change.

Looking at the HPG for the power up sequence, it seems like we should
be setting the bias in the middle of the dsi_pll_commit(), so the
order of operations is slight off, however I somewhat doubt that will
have a meaningful impact and it does seem like this change is in line
with the spirit of the HPG.

It wasn't clear to me from the commit message what usecase triggered
this.  You've made it clear that its suspend/resume (it would be good
if that was mentioned) and that its impacting an actual target.  To
me, the current description seemed more theoretical and didn't
describe the impact that was being addressed.  Overall, it really
didn't answer the "why should I care if I have this change" question.

Right now, I think my concerns are cosmetic, therefore I don't have
reservations about it being picked up.  If you like:
