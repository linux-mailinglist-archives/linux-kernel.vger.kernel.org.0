Nope, things already went horribly wrong in arm_smmu_device_reset() - 
sure, sometimes for some configurations it might *seem* like they didn't 
and that you can fudge the context bank state at arm's length from core 
code later, but the truth is that impl->cfg_probe is your last chance to 
guarantee that any necessary SMMU state is preserved.

The remainder of the problem involves reworking default domain 
allocation such that we can converge on what iommu_request_dm_for_dev() 
currently does but without the momentary attachment to a translation 
domain to cause hiccups. That's starting here:

The point of RMRR-like-things is that they identify not just the memory 
region but also the specific device accessing them, which means the 
IOMMU driver knows up-front which IDs etc. it must be careful not to 
disrupt. Obviously for SMMU that *would* be some new table (designed to 
encompass everything relevant) since literal RMRRs are specifically an 
Intel VT-d thing.

Careful bringing that up again, or I really will rework the context bank 
allocator to avoid this default domain problem entirely... ;)
