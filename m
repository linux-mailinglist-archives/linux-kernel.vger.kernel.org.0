Ugh, ok, thanks for clarifying and my mistake for not realizing
Denverton already violates that heuristic.

So now I'm trying to grok Christoph's suggestion. Are you saying that
all existing board-ids would assume old PCS format? That would mean
that Denverton gets the wrong format via board_ahci via the class code
matching? Maybe I'm not understanding the suggestion...

Another option might be that controllers >= 1.3.1 will stop using the
PCS twiddling, and then we go add a new board id where / if it happens
to matter in practice.
