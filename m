Subject: ext3/ext4 filesystem corruption under post 5.1.0 kernels
To:     linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
From:   Arthur Marsh <arthur.marsh@internode.on.net>

I have yet to bisect, but have had trouble with recent, post 5.1.0 kernels built from Linus' git head on both i386 (Pentium 4 pc) and amd64 (Athlon II X4 640).

The easiest way to trigger the problem is:

git gc

on the kernel source tree, although the problem can occur without doing a git gc.

The filesystem with the kernel source tree is the root file system, ext3, mounted as:

/dev/sdb7 on / type ext3 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro)

After the "Compressing objects" stage, the following appears in dmesg:

[  848.968550] EXT4-fs error (device sdb7): ext4_get_branch:171: inode #8: block 30343695: comm jbd2/sdb7-8: invalid block
[  849.077426] Aborting journal on device sdb7-8.
[  849.100963] EXT4-fs (sdb7): Remounting filesystem read-only
[  849.100976] jbd2_journal_bmap: journal block not found at offset 989 on sdb7-8

fsck -yv 

then reports:

# fsck -yv
fsck from util-linux 2.33.1
e2fsck 1.45.0 (6-Mar-2019)
/dev/sdb7: recovering journal
/dev/sdb7 contains a file system with errors, check forced.
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
Free blocks count wrong (4619656, counted=4619444).
Fix? yes

Free inodes count wrong (15884075, counted=15884058).
Fix? yes


/dev/sdb7: ***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED *****

Other times, I have gotten:

"Inodes that were part of a corrupted orphan linked list found."
"Block bitmap differences:"
"Free blocks sound wrong for group"

No problems have been observed with the 5.1.0 release kernel.

Any suggestions for narrowing down the issue welcome.

Arthur.
