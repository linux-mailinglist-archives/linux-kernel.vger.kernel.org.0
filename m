It would be nice to have more explanations in the comments as to why we
don't use rcu_assign_pointer() here (the very fast-path issue) and why
it is expected to be fine (the rq_lock() + post spinlock barrier) under
which condition. Some short summary of the changelog. Because that line
implies way too many subtleties.

Thanks.
