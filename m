It was really I was lost: I didn't realize the enabling (or disabling)
is going to be fine-grained as well until I read this changelog:

Disabling the softirqs is currently an all-or-nothing operation: either
all softirqs are enabled or none of them. However we plan to introduce a
per vector granularity of this ability to improve latency response and
make each softirq vector interruptible by the others.

Sorry for the confusion I made :)
