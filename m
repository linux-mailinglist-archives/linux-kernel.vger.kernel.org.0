Well, I thought the principle was that we'd mark generic APIs that had 
*either* a missing access_ok() check or a missing 
user_access_begin()/end() wrapping marked unsafe_*(), right?

__get_user() has __uaccess_begin()/end() on the inside, but doesn't have 
the access_ok() check, so those calls are 'unsafe' with regard to not 
being safe to untrusted (ptr,size) ranges.

I agree that all of these topics need equal attention:

 - leaking of cleared SMAP state (CLAC), which results in a silent 
   failure.

 - running user accesses without STAC, which results in a crash.

 - not doing an access_ok() check on untrusted (pointer,size) ranges, 
   which results in a silent failure as well.

I just think that any API that doesn't guarantee all of these are handled 
right probably needs to be unsafe_*() tagged.

It's much appreciated! In my previous mail I just wanted to inquire about 
the long term plan, whether we are going to get rid of all uses of 
__get_user() - to which the answer appears to be "yes". :-)

Thanks,
