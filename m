Overall makes sense to me. Thanks for the comprehensive commit message and
comments, they definitely help :)

Random musing: It's kind of unfortunate that we don't have a void varient of
drm_modeset_lock for when there's no acquire_ctx since we end up with a mix of
drm_modeset_lock calls with and without return checking.
