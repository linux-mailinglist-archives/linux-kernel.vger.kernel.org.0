Wouldn't be easier to just deinit/init()? ie: treat it like unload/load module.

But you'll lose some info then that maybe you'd like to keep across
suspend/resume cycles.

Sounds reasonable to me. I agree my use case isn't sensible in general. It just
happened because I was testing an operation that affected both hibernation and
rcutorture test and I tend to compile my kernels with everything built-in.
