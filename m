Dearest Friend,

I am Tibo Abdullah, I want to seek your assistance after my discovery
during auditing in my bank as I'm the manager of Bill and Exchange at
the Foreign Remittance Department in African Development Bank
Ouagadougou Burkina Faso.

In my department we discovered a sum of $21.300.000 million in an
account that belonged to one of our foreign customer. Upon maturity,
we sent a routine notifications to his forwarding addresses but got no
response.

After some months, we sent a reminder and finally discovered that our
customer died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I
found out that he did not leave a will and all attempts to trace his
next of kin were fruitless, I therefore, i want to used my position as
the Bill and Exchange Manager to have the fund transferred into your
account in your country.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that the
deceased person did not declare any next of kin in all his official
documents, including his bank deposit paperwork.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided as the head of my
department to make this business proposal to you, to apply for the
money as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement, and you will be given 35% of the total
amount, 60% will be for me and my colleague in my bank, while 5% will
be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of
transferring.

We will conclude this operation within 21 banking days based on the
amount of co-operation you will contribute.

You will apply and start the first transfer with Eleven million
[$11,000.000] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from
your side, then you shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining
amount to your account.

upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who
is deeply involved with me in this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,never let me down.
With my influence and the position of the bank official we can
transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can
provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our
physical arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will
destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence, you can come
immediately to discuss with me face to face.

Thank you for your understanding as I await your urgent response in
order to give you more details, don't forget to give me those
information below before we can go ahead in this business/project.
