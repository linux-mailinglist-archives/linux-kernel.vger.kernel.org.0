Well, if somebody wants to use some PHY driver other than the upstream's
standard one, then that person could simply load the custom driver
module first, such that it will bind to the PHY's device first.

It is also possible to manually unbind the standard driver from PHY's
device and then bind whatever driver you want.

This patch only improves the default behaviour that is common for all
NVIDIA Tegra boards, it doesn't prevent from doing any special
customizations.

Perhaps the Kconfig change could be dropped from this patch in order to
provide a bit more flexibility in regards to kernel's configuration, but
I'm very doubtful that realistically anyone would want to replace the
default driver with anything else on Tegra. The Kconfig change also puts
ChipIdea's UDC driver in line with the Tegra's EHCI driver that selects
USB_TEGRA_PHY, please see drivers/usb/host/Kconfig.

> Do you know are there any other drivers do such things?

I don't think that any of the USB host drivers are currently doing such
things, but in general there are quite a lot of drivers in kernel that
are using request_module [1].

[1] https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/ident/request_module

Please note that drivers/usb/host/ehci-tegra.c uses exported symbols
from usb/phy/phy-tegra-usb.c and that is why the EHCI driver doesn't
need to explicitly load the phy_tegra_usb module, the load happens
automatically because of the missing symbols.

Also, please note that it is possible to squash the Tegra EHCI driver
into ci_hdrc_tegra.c and then the explicit dependency on the
phy_tegra_usb won't be needed anymore since it will be replaced with an
implicit dependency. We (me and Peter Geis) already had some
experimental patches that do the successful squashing of the drivers,
but looks like Peter got sidetracked for a more important things for
now, we'll probably return to that work later on.
