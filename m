I'm not sure this is really for luck. As far as I can see, we need to do it
properly for this size estimation since it's the final size that will be
allocated (and thus needs to be available in whole).

For the other times there is explicit alignment, they seem justified too:
- in psb_gem_create: it is common to pass the aligned size when creating the
  associated GEM object with drm_gem_object_init, even though it's probably=
 not
  crucial given that this is not where allocation actually happens;
- in psbfb_create: the full size is apparently only really used to memset 0
  the allocated buffer. I think this makes sense for security reasons (and =
not
  leak previous contents in the additional space required for alignment).

What strikes me however is that each call to psb_gtt_alloc_range takes the
alignment as a parameter when it's really always PAGE_SIZE, so it should
probably just be hardcoded in the call to allocate_resource.

What do you think?

I'm not seeing this immediately, but I definitely have something strange
after having printed more lines than the smallest display can handle or
scrolling, where more than the actual size of the fb is used.

Maybe this is related to using the PowerVR-accelerated fb ops, that aren't
quite ready for this use case?

I'll give it a try with psbfb_roll_ops and psbfb_unaccel_ops instead to see
if it changes something for me. Maybe it would help for you too?

I suspect that the generic implementation is already bullet-proof for these
kinds of use case.

Cheers and thanks for the feedback,

Paul
