You're looking at the wrong property. You need to look for
'interrupts' and 'interrupts-extended'. Pretty good chance if the
device has interrupts, then it needs them. The latter is easy. It's
just like the others you have (phandle + cells). If you have
'interrupts' then you need to walk the interrupt tree the same way the
OF IRQ code already does.

Yes. both. The interrupt tree may or may not mirror the device node
tree. Or you could have a mixture. You've got to handle both cases.
But really, you just need to use the code that's already there to do
all that and deal with all these conditions. Essentially, you need to
copy of_irq_get(), but get the struct device from the irq_domain.
