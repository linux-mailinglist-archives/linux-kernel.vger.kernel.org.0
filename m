I think it's unlikely to be a QEMU bug, as it starts printing messages from the
payload and then hangs.  By the point QEMU is executing instructions it doesn't
really care about pointers any more and is just doing whatever the instructions
say to do.  It's possible QEMU decided to alias memory and blow everything up,
but I feel like that would manifest after Linux prints some messages.  Writing
this I feel like I've debugged that before...

If I had to bet I'd put the bug in OpenSBI, but only because I don't see any
Linux messages.  Specifically, I'd bet that someone did something like

    for (size_t i = 0; i < get_memory_size_from_fdt(); i += PAGE_SIZE)
       memory_base[i + K], for small values of K

which would blow up for some configurations of 34-bit memory sizes and 32-bit
size_t, given how the compiler likes to optimize things.  That definately
happens early in the kernel boot, but IIRC we print a message after mapping a
fixed number of pages (though that code was changed recently so I don't
remember how it works now).

I'd actually tested this before Olof brought up the issue and just put it in
the "I guess just don't do that" pile, but when he mentioned it was breaking
builds I remember chasing around some early kernel boot issue last time I
accidentally turned on a lot of memory and figured it's probably best to just
bail on the whole thing anyway.  IIRC part of the feedback on the original
and while it'd be nice to have (which is probably why I ignored the feedback) I
feel like there's more important ways to spend our time -- like getting a
32-bit userspace.

That said, I'd be happy to make this selectable by menuconfig.  Presumably it's
not that much work to chase around the drivers that blow up and add something
like "depends 64BIT || PHYS_ADDR_T_32BIT" until randconfig builds stop failing,
but I feel like that's as far as this is likely to go in the forseeable future.

Either way, I guess this is a good reminder it's better to remain causal.  I
suppose I'll try to do so in the future :)
