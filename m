Subject: Regression caused by patch a4f55d8b8c14 "usb: hub: Check device
 descriptor before resusciation"

Hello folks,

The $subject patch causes a regression on my HP EliteBook laptop with a
built-in USB bluetooth adapter. About 50% of the time, a suspend/resume
cycle will cause the bluetooth adapter to stop working.

The dmesg log below shows two suspend/resume cycles. At time 63.928 you can
see the bluetooth adapter being successfully resumed, and at time 140.969
you can see it fail. After reverting the patch, the bluetooth adapter
resumes 100% of the time.

I also included below a lsusb -v of the bluetooth adapter. Is there any
other debugging info you'd like me to send?

This is with Linus's tree as of yesterday, but the misbehavior goes back
to 5.5-rc1.
