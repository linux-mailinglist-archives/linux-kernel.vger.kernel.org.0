The flash unlock at probe was a bad decision, but we can't be backward=20
compatible. kconfig or module param will solve the problem without breaking=

backward compatibility.

I don't take this personally, but I think the discussion went in a wrong=20
direction, and I feel that we waste time on theoretical problems.

I don't want to introduce code which I don't know if it will ever be used.

- generic compatible eases the use. I don't have to check the dtb each time=
 I=20
change a plug-able flash, to see if I gave a wrong hint for the flash in th=
e=20
extended compatible
- people will prefer to use the extended compatible instead of trying to au=
to-
detect the differences at run-time (it's easier, but wrong).

If you possess 2 flashes that we can't correctly detect at run-time and you=
=20
care to fix them, then your suggestion has a good change to be implemented.=
 I=20
will not introduce code that is not used, in the hope that it will be used.=
 No=20
compatible extension if we have a way to auto-detect the flash.
