The microcode argument is not all that comforting :-)

Also what about unaligned accesses, e.g. if a struct member isn't on a
word boundary?  Arnd's godbolt link showed those can get combined too.

I don't see x86 memcpy() doing any destination alignment checks.

Have we audited other arches' memset/memcpy implementations?

It sounds like everybody's in agreement that replacing accesses with
memset/memcpy is bad in a kernel context.  Should we push for a new
fine-grained compiler option to disable it?
