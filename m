I tried this option in the past. Unfortunately, I didn't prevent 
freezes. My understanding is this option reserves some amount of memory 
to not be swapped out but does not prevent the kernel from evicting all 
pages from cache when more memory is needed.

Reclaiming memory is fine, of course, but not all the way to 0 caches. 
No caches means all executable pages, ro pages (e.g. fonts) are evicted 
from memory and have to be constantly reloaded on every user action. All 
this while competing with tasks that are using up all memory. This 
happens with of without swap, although swap does spread this issue in 
time a bit.

Thank you for the explanation. It is indeed a difficult problem - some 
cached pages (streaming IO) will likely not be needed again and should 
be discarded asap, other (like mmapped executable/ro pages of UI 
utilities) will cause thrashing when evicted under high memory pressure. 
Another aspect is that PSI is probably not the best measure of detecting 
imminent thrashing. However, if it can at least detect a freeze that has 
already occurred and force the OOM killer that is still a lot better 
than a dead system, which is the current user experience.

I am giving it as an example of a heuristic that seems to work very well 
for me. Something to look into. And yes, I wouldn't mind having such 
mechanism built into the kernel.

It is indeed a last resort solution - without it the system is unusable. 
Still, accuracy matters because killing a wrong task does not fix the 
problem (a task hogging memory is still running) and may break the 
system anyway if something important is killed instead.

> This is a useful feedback! What was your workload? Which kernel version?

I tested it by running a python script that processes a large amount of 
data in memory (needs around 15GB of RAM). I normally run 2 instances of 
that script in parallel but for testing I started 4 of them. I sometimes 
experience the same issue when using multiple regular memory intensive 
desktop applications in a manner described in the first post but that's 
harder to reproduce because of the user input needed.
