That would seem the proper thing do to.

So I was doing this for legacy hw as a cheap and quick performance 
boost, but I doubt how many other users there would be in future for any 
new API. Also, the effort could be more than the reward and so I may 
consider dropping the whole idea.

But I'll have a play with how the code could look now.

Cheers,
john
