I understand and you have a good point!

However, in my experience, the most common generic case, is that it's
a bad idea to let a device process interrupts once they have been
suspended. This also applies to runtime suspend (via runtime PM).

Again, you have a very good point. The corresponding driver for the
device in question is responsible for dealing with this.

Then, for this particular case, the SDIO func driver scenario, how
would that work?

For example, assume that the SDIO func driver can't process IRQs after
its been system suspended, however it still wants the IRQs to be
re-kicked to consume them once it has been resumed?

Or are you saying that the SDIO func driver for cases when IRQs can't
be consumed during system suspend, that is should call
sdio_release_irq() (then reclaim the IRQ once resumed)?

Kind regards
Uffe
