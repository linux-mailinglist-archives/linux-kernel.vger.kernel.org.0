Sorry just getting back to this.

I think the patch I sent earlier will add to your unhappiness.

Right, so this was done originally for optimizing range locking which
needed to do the iter_first a lot. fwiw pat_rbtree tree could also use
it before insertion. While I did not examine the other users of interval_tree,
I considered it overall worthwhile having; it comes at pretty
much no cost and the extra footprint has not been a problem so far for
users.

I've sent out a patch.

Thanks,
