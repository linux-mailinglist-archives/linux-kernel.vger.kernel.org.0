No, the resistance was against complicated code changes (games with
locks) and against removing useful messages. Such changes might cause
more harm than good.

I am not -mm maintainer so I could not guarantee that a patch
using printk_deferred() will get accepted. But it will have much
bigger chance than the original patch.

Anyway, printk_deferred() is a lost war. It is temporary solution
for one particular scenario. But as you said, there might be many
others. The long term solution is the printk rework.
