It would seem that we hold the moniker of responsibility for this
conversation, since without our provocation regarding cryptographic
verification of enclave source, there would be a driver headed
upstream whose only constraint against W^X sourced executable code,
running with full confidentiality and integrity protections, would be
a character device with o666 permissions.  Given that, a couple of
reflections to facilitate further conversation, if nothing else for
the benefit of Jonathan Corbet and his bystanders... :-)

As the conversations to date have indicated, imposing LSM controls on
enclave executable code is a bit problematic, in no small part since
it is the theological equivalent of driving a square peg into a round
hole.  SGX, as a technology, was designed around the concept of
cryptographic verification of code provenance and origin.

The decision to take that off the table, for reasons of political
idealogy only, means that mainstream Linux will not be a platform that
can achieve the full hardware security capabilities and protections of
SGX, nor will mainstream Linux be able to enjoy full protections from
the technology itself.

We will be dealing with that, from a driver and runtime perspective,
but that is a conversation for another day.

The issue of SGX2 and Enclave Dynamic Memory Management (EDMM) has
come up and to date there doesn't appear to have been a serious
conversation regarding whether or not all of the LSM machinations in
the world will make any difference when this technology goes mainline.
The agenda driving mainlining of the driver is to support Graphene for
cloud based solutions and without EDMM, dynamic code loading support
is decidedly more problematic.

Dynamic enclave code loading isn't problematic from a security
perspective when the code is being loaded from the platform itself,
since presumably, the encompassing conversation will result in LSM
controls being applied to the necessary code paths.  However, with the
ability to exploit SGX2 instructions, an enclave with adverserial
intent could simply setup a mutually attested security context and
pull whatever executable code it wants from the INTERNET at large,
using an encrypted and integrity protected communications channel.

That has at least been our interpretation and experience with the
ENCLU[EMODPE] and ENCLU[EACCEPTCOPY] instructions and the out-of-tree
driver.  Given the use of an encrypted channel, and the fact that
these instructions are ring 3 enclave mode only, it would seem that
all of the LSM controls in the world won't have visibility or control
over code that is being loaded and executed using such a mechanism.

We could have arguably missed something that the new driver will do to
address this issue.  To date the only discussion seems to have been
about controls over ENCLS[EAUG], which are arguably a bit blunt for
this purpose.

In the land of SGX, if one is intellectually honest from an
engineering perspective, the only solid security contract one has to
work with is the notion of cryptographic identity.  Hence our concern
and patches that implemented an absolutely minimal footprint ring-0
control infrastructure over the contents of an enclave's SIGSTRUCT.
Which is where we have arguably circled back to after 3-4 months and
one kernel release cycle.

Wrapping an LSM hook around our policy mechanism would seem to
achieve, from a security perspective, about the same level of security
effect that more major and invasive modifications would achieve, given
Cedric's proposal to inherit page permissions from the source, which
is what our runtime already does.

As always, apologies for excessive verbosity beyond LKML sensibilities.

Best wishes for a pleasant remainder of the spring weekend to
everyone.
