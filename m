Right, so in my patchset there is indeed individual soft vectors masked
so we indeed need per vector checks. For example a lock taken in HRTIMER
softirq shouldn't be a problem if it is concurrently taken while BLOCK softirq
is enabled. And for that we expand the usage_mask so that the 4 bits currently
used for general SOFTIRQ are now multiplied by NR_SOFTIRQ (10) because we need to
track the USED and ENABLED_IN bits for each of them.

The end result is:

4 hard irq bits + 4 * 10 softirq bits + LOCK_USED bit = 45 bits.

Not sure that answers the question as I'm a bit lost in the debate...
