I'm perfectly fine with Link:, however Reported-By: usually has the 
person's name and email address (i.e. PII data per GDPR definition). If 
that person submitted the bug report via bugzilla.kernel.org or a 
similar resource, their expectation is that they can delete their 
account should they choose to to do so. However, if the patch containing 
Reported-By is committed to git, their PII becomes permanently and 
immutably recorded for any reasonable meaning of the word "forever."

Now, I'm pretty sure that a request to rebase git history to edit a 
commit message would be considered "unreasonable" under GDPR provisions, 
but a) it still eats up valuable time handling such requests and b) it's 
a consequence reporters are not aware of when they submit bug reports.  
So, my request to ask for permission before using "Reported-By" is not 
coming from any legal position, but from the perspective of courtesy to 
people submitting those reports.
