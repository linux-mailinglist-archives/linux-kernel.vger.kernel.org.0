Having a little play around with this, I think you can simply remove the
panfrost_regulator_init() call. This at least works for me - the call to
dev_pm_opp_set_regulators() seems to set everything up. However I
suspect you need to do this unconditionally even if there are no
operating points defined.

To be honest this is an area I still don't fully understand. There's a
lot of magic helper functions and very little in the way of helpful
documentation to work out which are the right ones to call. It seems
reasonable to me, hopefully someone more in the know will chime in it
there's something fundamentally wrong!

Thanks,

Steve
