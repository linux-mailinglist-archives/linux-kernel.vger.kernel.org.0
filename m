Could you clarify what this means ? Do you mean that when state 1 is
selected, the probability that the CPU will be in state 1 for the
duration corresponding to state 2's residency is 30% ?

Further more, this means that during idle state selection we have O(n)
complexity if n is the number of idle states, since we want to select
a state where we are more likely to reside ?

So we only update the weight in just one cell ?

To use the example above, if we selected state 1, and we resided in it
for a duration corresponding to state 2's residency, we will only
update state_mat[1][2] ?

Can the effect of this staleless be observed ? For instance, if we
have a particular idle entry/exit pattern for a very long duration,
say a few 10s of minutes and then the idle entry/exit pattern changes,
how bad will the weighted approach be compared to the current TEO
governor ?

Could you also provide power measurements for the duration when the
system is completely idle for each of the variants of TEO governor ?
Is it the case that the benefits that we are seeing above are only due
to Wt. TEO being more conservative than TEO governor by always
choosing a shallower state ?
