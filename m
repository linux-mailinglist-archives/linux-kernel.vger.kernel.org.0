The idea is good, but as Ingo pointed out this needs very careful checking
of 'regs'. get_irq_regs() is really only valid from interrupt context up to
the point where the old irq regs (default NULL) are restored, i.e. after
irq_exit() from where softirqs are invoked.

One slightly related thing I was looking into is that the mixing of
interrupt entropy is always done from hard interrupt context. That has a
few issues:

    1) It's pretty visible in profiles for high frequency interrupt
       scenarios.

    2) The regs content can be pretty boring non-deterministic when the
       interrupt hits idle.

       Not an issue in the try_to_generate_entropy() case probably, but
       that still needs some careful investigation.

For #1 I was looking into a trivial storage model with a per cpu ring
buffer, where each entry contains the entropy data of one interrupt and let
some thread or whatever handle the mixing later.

That would allow to filter out 'constant' data (#) but it would also give
Joerns approach a way to get to some 'random' register content independent
of the context in which the timer softirq is running in.
