Re-reading this today morning, I realize that this isn't entirely 
accurate. SPURR alone is sufficient to understand core resource 
utilization.

Kamalesh is using PURR to display non-normalized utilization values 
(under 'actual' column), as reported by lparstat on AIX. I am not 
entirely sure if it is ok to derive these based on the SPURR busy/idle 
ratio.
