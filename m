I'm more than glad to get the root cause, if you can help on debugging I
would like to share the efi var file etc.

But it is indeed a problem cause weird reset on end user part, but even if we can
not find the root cause (in firmware..)  I think we still need avoid it
with such workaround.

Thanks
