I thought the current status was that we don=E2=80=99t always switch to init=
_mm on idle and instead we use a fancier and actually correct flushing routi=
ne that only flushed idle CPUs when pagetables are freed.  I still think we s=
hould be able to kill active_mm in favor of explicit refcounting in the arch=
 code.=
