Thank you for the feedback, Alan. I understood your comment. It
seems to be a good idea to use sg_tablesize to alleviate the memory
pressure of the host. But I think 16 is too small for USB 3.0 device
because USB 3.0 storage device in my machine usually uses more than
30 SG entries. So, I will set sg_tablesize to 32.
