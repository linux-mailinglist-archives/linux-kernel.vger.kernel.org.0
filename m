Good point, efi_mem_reserve_persistent() has no way of describing what a region is for,
you have to know that from somewhere else.

This would need to go in the chosen node of the DT, like power-pc already does. This would
work on arm64:ACPI systems too (because they have a DT chosen node).


I'd like to understand why removing these entries is needed, it doesn't look like we have
an API call to remove them from the efi mem-reserve...

If it had a fixed position in memory its the sort of thing we'd expect firmware to
reserved during boot. (e.g. ramoops).

From ima_add_kexec_buffer() this really is a transient memory reservation over kexec.
I think the efi mem-reserve and a DT-chosen node entry with the PA is the only way to make
this work smoothly between DT<->ACPI systems.

We'd need a way of removing the efi mem-reserve in ima_free_kexec_buffer(), otherwise the
memory remains lost. The DT-chosen node entry should have its pointer zero'd out once
we've done this. (like we do for the KASLR seed).


Not considered is parsing the DT-chosen node entry as if it were a memreserve during early
boot. This wouldn't work if you kexec something that doesn't know what the node is, it
would overwrite the the memory and may not remove the node for the next kexec, which does.


Thanks,

James
