Yep, that's our intent as well.

Yep.

That makes sense.  I was thinking it'd be helpful to leave the bits set,
e.g. for users to differentiate between "I don't have SGX" and "I can't
use SGX because SGX_LC is disabled".  But I'm probably being slightly
optomistic...

I'm 99% certain this won't even require a change to the proposed KVM
patches, as KVM mostly pulls SGX support directly from CPUID.  The only
thing it checks via cpu_has() is SGX_LC to query whether or not the MSRs
are fully writable.

Keeping the SGX feature bits set was more about reflecting hardware
capabilities than it was a functional requirement.
