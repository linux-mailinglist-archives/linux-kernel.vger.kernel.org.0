I think Roman only test with BIOS configured as single-segment. So he 
hard-code the segment# here.

I'm not sure if Roman can do some test with multiple-segment BIOS. If 
not, I think we should at least print a warning here.

I think we don't need a complete PCI address here. The attr is to 
disclose the mapping information between die and PCI BUS. Segment:BUS 
should be good enough.
