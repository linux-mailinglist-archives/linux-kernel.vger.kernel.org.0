Isn't it more like: "Consider waking task on waking CPU"?

IIRC, with this flag set the wake-up can happen either near prev_cpu or
this_cpu.

Perhaps add +" (SMT)" to the comment to help the uninitiated
understanding it a bit easier?

This flag is set only by 32-bit arm and has never had any effect. I
think it was the beginning of something years ago that hasn't
progressed. Perhaps we can remove it now?

Place busy _tasks_ earlier in the domain?

It is a bit unclear what 'earlier' means here but since the packing
ordering can actually be defined by the architecture, we can't be much
more specific I guess.
