I have been wondering for a while
which version of spdx tags I should use in my work.


I know the 'GPL-2.0' tag is already deprecated.
(https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0.html)


But, I saw negative reaction to this:
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/975394/

Nor "-only" / "-or-later" are documented in
Documentation/process/license-rules.rst


In this patch series, Thomas used 'GPL-2.0-only' and 'GPL-2.0-or-later'
instead of 'GPL-2.0' and 'GPL-2.0+'.

Now, we have a great number of users of spdx v3 tags.
$ git grep -P 'SPDX-License-Identifier.*(?:-or-later|-only)'| wc -l
4135



So, what I understood is:

  For newly added tags, '*-only' and '*-or-later' are preferred.

(But, we do not convert existing spdx v2 tags globally.)



Joe's patch was not merged, but at least
Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
should be updated in my opinion.

(Perhaps, checkpatch.pl can suggest newer tags in case
patch submitters do not even know that deprecation.)


Thanks.
