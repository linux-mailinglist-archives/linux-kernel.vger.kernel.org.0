Please do not use lkml.org links, they tend to break longterm. Use
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/$msg_id instead.

yes this looks sensible. We already do restrict offlining memry blocks
which span multiple zones (e.g. when NUMA nodes are interleaved through
a memblock boundary) so this is not the first restriction like that.
If that allows future changes then let's just try it out and see whether
there are real usecases that needs to handle boottime memory with holes
hotremove.
