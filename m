Agreed.

I wanted you to say that :-) I'll rework along those lines. Just a nit
or two:

Not fan of using -EFAULT here, it's a detail since it's rather kernel
internal, but I'd rather use -ENXIO for no match and -EIO for failed
(or pass the original error code up if any). That said it's really bike
shed painting at this point :-)

So this changes the existing behaviour in one way that may or may not
matter, I don't know:

If setup() fails, the existing code will not exit. That means that if
the console has CON_ENABLED already set (some do set it statically or
set it from outside this function, I haven't looked into details the
various circumstances this can happen), the existing code will still
insert it. Your patch will make us not insert it.

No worries. This isn't super urgent.

Cheers,
Ben.
