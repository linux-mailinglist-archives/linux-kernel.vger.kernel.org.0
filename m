Sorry. I was only ever talking about sched_other as per the original patchset. I realize the term extreme latency 
sensitivity may have caused confusion. What that means to DB people is no doubt different than audio people. :-)

There are existing internal numbers that I will ultimately have to duplicate that show that simply short-cutting these 
idle cpu searches has a significant benefit on DB performance on large hardware. However that was for a different 
patchset involving things I don't like so I'm still exploring how to achieve similar results within the latency_nice 
framework.
