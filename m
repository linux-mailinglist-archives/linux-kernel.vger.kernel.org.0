That'd be fine. As long as there is no duplication and two 
terms/prefixes used for the same thing I am happy.

Right, and it's fine to add a timeout. The question is why add a timeout 
*only* for a broadcast operation? It should be added for every 
transaction IMO, unless you have a reason not to do so.

Right, so it's probably the comment that's too strict. It's not no pings 
it's no pings during a sequence of up to N read/writes.
