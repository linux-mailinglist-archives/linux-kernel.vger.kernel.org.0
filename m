Thanks!  I really like this idea.

I know this is called from arch specific code here to fit in with the timing
of CMA setup/reservation calls.  However, there really is nothing architecture
specific about this functionality.  It would be great IMO if we could make
this architecture independent.  However, I can not think of a straight forward
way to do this.

The alignment is hard coded for x86 gigantic page size.  If this supports
more architectures or becomes arch independent we will need to determine
what this alignment should be.  Perhaps an arch specific call back to get
the alignment for gigantic pages.  That will require a little thought as
some arch's support multiple gigantic page sizes.
