Thing is, we use insn for instruction all over both arch/x86/ and
objtool.

My personal naming preference didn't make it due to CoC reasons :-/

notrace already exists and we didn't want to confuse things further.

Hasn't happened yet, initially we were thinking of using .entry.text for
this as a whole, but decided against that due to how .entry.text is
special for PTI (although exposing most of this code really wouldn't
matter).

The thing with .sched.text is that we really should never call into
scheduling from these contexts anyway. We've not ran into meminit yet.
(all this finicky entry code is ran with IRQs disabled).

The one that could potentially interfere is .cpuidle.text.

Thing is, I really _hate_ that annotation style.

Fair enough I suppose...

but you're ruining things here, see, for a regular x86_64 config, we'd
run this with:

	objtool check -fail vmlinux.o

And I was hoping to get vmlinux.o objtool clean, surprisingly there
really aren't that many complaints. But the -i thing makes it run
significantly faster without duplicating all the bits we've already
checked.

Anyway, let me address and refresh the series while we bicket about
naming later. I'm thikning Thomas would much prefer to get his first
round of patches out first.
