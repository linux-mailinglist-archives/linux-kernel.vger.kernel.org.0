I think you need to clarify access protection rules. Is it only
translation that is bypassed or is any platform-specific
protection mechanism bypassed too?

OK so I think I am beginning to see it in a different light.  Right now the specific
platform creates an identity mapping. That in turn means DMA API can be
fast - it does not need to do anything.  What you are looking for is a
way to tell host it's an identity mapping - just as an optimization.

Is that right?  So this is what I would call this option:

VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM_IDENTITY_ADDRESS

and the explanation should state that all device
addresses are translated by the platform to identical
addresses.

In fact this option then becomes more, not less restrictive
than VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM - it's a promise
by guest to only create identity mappings,
and only before driver_ok is set.
This option then would always be negotiated together with
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.

Host then must verify that
1. full 1:1 mappings are created before driver_ok
    or can we make sure this happens before features_ok?
    that would be ideal as we could require that features_ok fails
2. mappings are not modified between driver_ok and reset
    i guess attempts to change them will fail -
    possibly by causing a guest crash
    or some other kind of platform-specific error

So far so good, but now a question:

how are we handling guest address width limitations?
Is VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM_IDENTITY_ADDRESS subject to
guest address width limitations?
I am guessing we can make them so ...
This needs to be documented.

Not sure how this answers the question.

That's possible in theory but in practice we did not yet teach VFIO not
to attach to legacy devices without VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.  So all
security relies on host denying driver_ok without
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.  New options that bypass guest security are
thus tricky as they can create security holes for existing guests.
I'm open to ideas about how to do this in a safe way,

Right but I wonder how are you going to *actually* implement it on Linux?
Are you adding a new set of DMA APIs that do everything except
translation?
