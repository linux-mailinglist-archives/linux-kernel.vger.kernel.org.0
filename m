OK now I see what causes the confusion.

With SEV, the encryption state is, while *physically* encoded in an 
address bit, from what I can tell, not *logically* encoded in the pfn, 
but in the page_prot for cpu mapping purposes.  That is, page_to_pfn()  
returns the same pfn whether the page is encrypted or unencrypted. Hence 
nobody can't tell from the pfn whether the page is unencrypted or encrypted.

For device DMA address purposes, the encryption status is encoded in the 
dma address by the dma layer in phys_to_dma().

No, from what I can tell the call in these functions to dma_pgprot() 
generates an incorrect page protection since it doesn't take unencrypted 
coherent memory into account. I don't think anybody has used these 
functions yet with SEV.

It looks like that, although there are comments in the code about 
serious performance problems using VM_PFNMAP / vmf_insert_pfn() with 
write-combining and PAT, so that would require some serious testing with 
hardware I don't have. But I guess there is definitely room for 
improvement here. Ideally we'd like to be able to change the 
vma->vm_page_prot within fault(). But we can

Yes, but as a longer term solution I would prefer a general dma_pgprot() 
exported, so that we could, in a dma-compliant way, use coherent pages 
with other apis, like kmap_atomic_prot() and vmap(). That is, basically 
split coherent page allocation in two steps: Allocation and mapping.

I guess you'd have to ask AMD about that. But my understanding is that 
encoding it in an address bit does make it trivial to do decryption / 
encryption on the fly to DMA devices that are not otherwise aware of it, 
just by handing them a special physical address. For cpu mapping 
purposes it might become awkward to encode it in the pfn since 
pfn_to_page and friends would need knowledge about this. Personally I 
think it would have made sense to track it like PAT in track_pfn_insert().

Thanks,
