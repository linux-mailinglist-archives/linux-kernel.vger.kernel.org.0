Hi Nick, Kees, Ard,

Thanks for the responses.

Thanks for having a look. It could be that we've fixed the issue Catalin was
running into in the past -- he was going to see if the problem persists with
mainline, since it was frequent enough that it was causing us to ignore the
results from our testing infrastructure when RANDOMIZE_BASE=y.

I mean, we could have RANDOMIZE_BASE select UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 if you like?
The latter is already default y and hidden behind EXPERT.

That's not a bad idea. If you do that, feel free to add my Ack to the one
adding RANDOMIZE_BASE=y:
