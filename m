Also, your subject line for all of these patches are wrong, it is not
drivers/acrn :(

And you forgot to cc: the staging maintainer :(

As I have said with NUMEROUS Intel patches in the past, I now refuse to
take patches from you all WITHOUT having it signed-off-by someone from
the Intel "OTC" group (or whatever the Intel Linux group is called these
days).  They are a resource you can not ignore, and if you do, you just
end up making the rest of the kernel community grumpy by having us do
their work for them :(

Please work with them.
