Before we get too involved with this, I really don't want to start a trend of
"let's try to rewrite all code using cmpxchg() in Linux because of TX2". At
some point, the hardware needs to play ball. However...

Ard's refcount patch was about moving the overflow check out-of-line. A
side-effect of this, is that we avoid the cmpxchg() operation from many of
the operations (atomic_add_unless() disappears), and it's /this/ which helps
you. So there may well be a middle ground where we avoid the complexity of
the out-of-line {over,under}flow handling but do the saturation post-atomic
inline.

I was hoping we could use LDMIN/LDMAX to maintain the semantics of
REFCOUNT_FULL, but now that I think about it I can't see how we could keep
the arithmetic atomic in that case. Hmm.

Whatever we do, I prefer to keep REFCOUNT_FULL the default option for arm64,
so if we can't keep the semantics when we remove the cmpxchg, you'll need to
opt into this at config time.

Will
