We have been thinking this since we were asked if SMC can be transport.
Generally out of 16 SGIs, 8 are reserved for secure side and non-secure
has 8. Of these 8, IIUC 7 is already being used by kernel. So unless we
manage to get the last one reserved exclusive to SCMI, it makes it
difficult to add SGI support in SCMI.

We have been telling partners/vendors about this limitation if they
use SMC as transport and need to have dedicated h/w interrupt for the
notifications.

Another issue could be with virtualisation(using HVC) and EL handling
so called SCMI SGI. We need to think about those too. I will try to get
more info on this and come back on this.
