After checking, arch_local_save_flags() already has the following
comment above it:

/*



 * Save the current interrupt enable state.



 */


Which suggests you shouldn't rely on having the value of debug state and
other (it just happens to be there, maybe wrongfully...).

And user checking the flags should use arch_irqs_disabled_flags() rather
than "flags & PSR_I_BIT != 0".

Also, those semantics where already changed when we introduced priority
masking and included the PMR value in the irqflags.

I'm not sure there is a lot more explanation to do in this patch in
particular.
