It has taken a while for this to soak in.  This is actually quite an
insidious issue.  If I give an example and perhaps we can come to a
solution.  This example is based on the code (and assumptions) in
mm/slub.c

If a developer has an object that they wish to add to sysfs they go
ahead and embed a kobject in it.  Correctly set up a ktype including
release function that just frees the object (using container of).  Now
assume that the object is already set up and in use when we go to set up
the sysfs entry.  If kobject_init_and_add() fails and we correctly call
kobject_put() the containing object will be free'd.  Yet the calling
code may not be done with the object, more to the point just because
sysfs setup fails the object is now unusable.  Besides the interesting
theoretical discussion this means we cannot just go and willy-nilly add
calls to kobject_put() in the error path of kobject_init_and_add() if
the original code was not written under the assumption that the release
method could be called during the error path (I have found 2 places at
least where behaviour of calling the release method is non-trivial to
ascertain).

I guess, as Greg said, its just a matter that reference counting within
the kernel is a hard problem.  So we fix the easy ones and then look a
bit harder at the hard ones ...

Any better suggestion?

thanks,
Tobin.
