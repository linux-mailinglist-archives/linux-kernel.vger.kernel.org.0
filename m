FYI, archive link below, but the short version is that the patch fixed
a problem seen with SELinux/labeled-NFS and after not hearing anything
from the NFS folks for over a week I went ahead and merged it into the
SELinux tree.  With everything going on in the world at the moment I
didn't want this fix to get lost.  I have no problem reverting the
patch in the SELinux -next branch if you guys would prefer to push
this up to Linus via the NFS tree; I just want to make sure we get
this fixed.
