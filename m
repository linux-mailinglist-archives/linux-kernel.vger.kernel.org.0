Hi,

setup_irq() was used in olden days, nowadays request_irq(). Though
there are exceptions of trying to use setup_irq() even recently, but
there has been pushback when people notice it like Thomas had done
[1], and i saw recently one in mips smp support series & suggested not
to use it (that code iiuc they had it out of upstream for a long time).

So existence of setup_irq() in general i have considered to be legacy
code.

The way i came up with this series is that while trying to understand
irq internals, came across [1], so then decided to do cleanup and i
thought scripting it would make it easy & also had been wanting to
get familiar w/ cocci, so decided to try it, but also realized that i
cannot fully automate it (Julia said my patch is okay, so i felt cocci
cannot fully automate w/o investing considerable effort in cocci), so
even w/ this v2, there are lot of manual changes, though cocci made it
easier.

And Thomas suggested to make improvements over script generated o/p [2]
and only consider scripting as an initial first step. So the way i am
making changes now is to take suggestions from Thomas to be applied
treewide, at the same time also take care of suggestions from
arch/subsytem maintainer/mailing list in the relevant patches, since
arch maintainers are the ones owning it.

Sometimes had a feeling as though the changes in this series is akin
to cutting the foot to fit the shoe ;), but still went ahead as it was
legacy code, easier & less error prone. But now based on the overall
feedback, to proceed, i had to change.

Regards
afzal
