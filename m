Hmm it looks like you are right.  Sorry!

Well this is not what the spec says in the end.
To continue that commit message:

    This patch makes the "tell host first" logic the only case.  This
    should make everybody happy, and reduce the amount of untested or
    untestable code in the kernel.

you can try proposing the change to the virtio TC, see what do others
think.

I'm not sure it's not too late to change what that flag means.  If not
sending deflate messages at all is a useful optimization, it seems
safer to add a feature flag for that.
