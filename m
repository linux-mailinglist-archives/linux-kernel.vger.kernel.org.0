I think the configuration value that settimeofday changes is not
actually a time zone, but an time offset used to interpret various
things, mostly in a dual-boot environment with Windows, apparently
(Like the default time offset for extracting timetamps from FAT
volumes.)

This data has to come from *somewhere*.  The TZ variable and
/etc/localtime cover something else entirely.

Maybe it is possible to replace these things with other mechanisms
which exist today.  For example, the mount program could read a
configuration file to determine the system default for the time_offset
mount option and apply the value automatically.  The real-time clock
offset could be maintained by whatever mechanism hwclock uses.

I think whatever we end up doing, we should maintain consistency after
a system upgrade after architectures.  It does not make sense to keep
using the settimeofday hack on amd64 indefinitely, and switch to a
different mechanism on RV32, so that the two ways of supplying the
offset are never reconciled across architectures.
