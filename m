After having a second look at the code again, I probably misread the
code the first time around. In the sleeping path, there is a check of
queue.status and setting of task state both under the sem lock in the
sleeping path. So as long as setting of queue status is under lock, they
should synchronize properly.

It looks like queue status setting is under lock, but I can't use
lockdep to confirm that as the locking can be done by either the array
lock or in one of the spinlocks in the array. Are you aware of a way of
doing that?

Anyway, I do think we need to add some comment to clarify the situation
to avoid future confusion.
