I meant associating endpoints devices to the IOMMU they are connected
to.

In DT you do it through "iommus", "iommu-map" properties, in ACPI
it is arch specific, doable nonetheless through ACPI (IORT on ARM)
static tables data.

In ACPI (at least on ARM but on x86 I suspect that's the same story with
the DMAR table) an SMMU is presented in FW as an entry in a static
table (eg IORT on ARM). I noticed that your patch series takes into
account for instance eg clock dependencies in DT; this way the OS knows
the clock(s) the SMMU depends on to be activated.

In ACPI there is not a notion of "clock" (hopefully - unless someone
sneaked that in using _DSD properties) but rather every device in the
ACPI namespace (which is part of tables containing code that needs the
ACPI interpreter to be used such as SSDT/DSDT - it is AML code) has ACPI
objects describing power resources (ie ACPI specification 6.3, 7.2).

The SMMU, since it is not itself an ACPI object in the ACPI namespace
but rather an entry in a static ACPI table (IORT on ARM), can't have
PowerResource object in it which means that at the moment there is no
way you can detect a dependency on other power resources to be ON to
build the device links you require to sort out the probe dependencies,
which I *assume* that's the reason why you require to detect
clock dependencies in DT.

Maybe it is not even needed at all but in case it is I was giving
a heads-up to say that clocks (or rather an all encompassing "power
resource" dependency) dependencies in ACPI to build an SMMU as
a module are not straightforward and most certainly will require
firmware specifications updates.

*Hopefully* in the short term all you need to detect is how endpoint
devices are connected to an IOMMU and build device links to describe
that probe dependency, if we need to throw power management into
the picture there is more work to be done.

I hope that's clearer, if it is not please let me know and I will
try to be more precise.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
