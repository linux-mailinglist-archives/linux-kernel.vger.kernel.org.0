My intention is to use this in fs allocators to notify virtual block devices
about allocated blocks (like in patch [3/3]). Filesystems allocators know about
written and unwritten extents, and they don't need a zeroing of allocated blocks.

Since a block range allocation action is less complicated (and faster), than
operation of allocation + zeroing of allocated blocks (at least for some devices),
we just choose it as the fastest. This is the reason we avoid zeroing.

Not introduction a new operation is a good thing. Especially, since we don't
need a specific max_xxx_xxx_sectors != max_write_zeroes_sectors for it.

I'll rework the patch in this way (it seems it will become pretty small
after that).

One more thing to discuss. The new REQ_NOZERO flag won't be supported
by many block devices (their number will be even less, than number of
REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES supporters). Will this be a good thing, in case
of we will be completing BLKDEV_ZERO_ALLOCATE bios in __blkdev_issue_write_zeroes()
before splitting? I mean introduction of some flag in struct request_queue::limits.
Completion of them with -EOPNOTSUPP in block devices drivers looks
suboptimal for me.

Thanks,
Kirill
