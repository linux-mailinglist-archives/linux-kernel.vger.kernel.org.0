I've confirmed that grub-x86 doesn't support devicetree option. I tried
to add it, and tested it.

https://github.com/mhiramat/grub/commit/644c35bfd2d18c772cc353b74215344f8264923a

This works if there is ACPI, if it includes /chosen/linux,ftrace node only.
(Anyway, we don't need other nodes on x86)

At this moment, grub doesn't support DT overlay, so on arm/arm64 user must
decompile DTB, add linux,ftrace node for tracing and compile it again.
But if it supports overlay, I think we can give an overlay for tracer setting
on boot up, that will be handy on arm/arm64 too. :)

Thank you,
