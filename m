Hi,

the new full barrier in desc_reserve() made me to think more about
the existing ones.

If I get it correctly, the used cmpxchg_relaxed() variants does
not provide full barriers. They are just able to prevent parallel
manipulation of the modified variable.

Because of this, I think that we need some more barriers to synchronize
reads and writes of the tail/head values of the three ring buffers.
See below for more details.

It is possible that some of the barriers are superfluous because
some read barriers are hidden in desc_read(). But I think that
barriers are sometimes needed even before the first read or
after the last read in desc_read().

IMHO, we should add smp_wmb() here to make sure that the reusable
state is written before we shuffle the desc_ring->tail_id/head_id.

It would pair with the read part of smp_mb() in desc_reserve()
before the extra check if the descriptor is really in reusable state.

IMHO, we need smp_rmb() here to make sure that we read blk->id
that we written after pushing the tail_lpos.

It would pair with the write barrier in data_alloc() before
before writing blk->id. It is there after updating head_lpos.
But head_lpos could be updated only after updating tail_lpos.
See the comment in data_alloc() below.

IMHO, we need smp_wmb() here so that others see the updated
data_ring->tail_lpos before this thread allocates the space
by pushing head_pos.

It would be paired with a read barrier in data_alloc() between
reading head_lpos and tail_lpos, see below.

IMHO, we need smp_wmb() here so that everyone see updated
desc_ring->tail_id before we push the head as well.

It would pair with read barrier in desc_reserve() between reading
tail_id and head_id.

IMHO, we need smp_rmb() here to to guarantee reading head_id before
desc_ring->tail_id.

It would pair with write barrier in desc_push_tail() after updating
tail_id, see above.

I am a bit confused by the full barrier here. The description is not
clear. All the three tags (data_push_tail:A, desc_push_tail:D and
prb_first_seq:C) refers read barriers. This would suggest that write
barrier would be enough here.

OK, this barrier is between writing desc_ring->head_id and
reading/writing desc->state_var.

A write barrier here would require a code that reads
desc->state_var before reading head_id, tail_id of desc
or data rings when they check if the descriptor was
reused before. It seems that all the mentioned paring
read barriers are correct. So the above description of
the write barrier part looks correct.

Now, the question is why the read barrier would be needed
here. The only reason might be the check of the desc->state_var.
The pairing write barrier should allow reusing of the descriptor.
For this, we might need to add a write barrier either into
prb_commit() or desc_make_reusable() after updating
the state variable.

We check here if the descriptor is really reusable. So it should
be enough to add write barrier into desc_make_reusable().

IMHO, we need smp_rmb() here to read begin_lpos before we read
tail_lpos in data_push_tail()

It would pair with a write barrier in data_push_tail() after
updating data_ring->tail_lpos.

IMHO, we need smp_wmb() here to guarantee that others see the updated
data_ring->head_lpos before we write anything into the data buffer.

It would pair with a read barrier in data_make_reusable
between reading tail_lpos and blk->id in data_make_reusable().
