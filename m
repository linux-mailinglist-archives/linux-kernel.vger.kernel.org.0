I don't care who is malicious and who is not. Of course I can't count
on "first one wins" to do that...
What I care about, is that two different processes won't be able to
send jobs to the device at the same time. That's it.
But I see your point about not using file-descriptors to enforce this
limitation.
I will change my code, but it will take a bit of time. It's not a
trivial change.
