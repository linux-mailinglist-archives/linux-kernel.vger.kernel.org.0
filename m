I think I understand.

It is intentional - currently - that KUnit doesn't generate a new
.config with every invocation. The reason is basically to support
interaction with other methods of generating .configs. Consider that
you might want to use make menuconfig to turn something on. It is a
pretty handy interface if you work on vastly different parts of the
kernel. Or maybe you have a defconfig that you always use for some
platform, I think it is easier to run

make foo_config; tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run

Then having to maintain both your defconfig and a .kunitconfig which
is a superset of the defconfig.

Your change would make it so that you have to have a .kunitconfig for
every test environment that you care about, and you could not as
easily take advantage of menuconfig.

I think what we do now is a bit janky, and the use cases I mentioned
are not super well supported. So I am sympathetic to what you are
trying to do, maybe we could have a config option for it?

I think Ted and Bjorn might have opinions on this; they had some
related opinions in the past.
