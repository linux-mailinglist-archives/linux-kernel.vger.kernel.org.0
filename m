It's a circular dependency. The pinctrl driver requires a regulator, which
is provided by the PMIC, which requires the pinctrl driver to mux a pin
for the bus.

For now there's no way to fix it, other than breaking the dependency.

Yes. That is the preferred and probably only way to deal with it.
Please leave a comment saying why vcc-pl was skipped.
