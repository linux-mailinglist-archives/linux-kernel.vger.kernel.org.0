FWIW, I don't think there is anything to implement; I don't see any
differences in functionality.

I am much more concerned about weakening the already weak detection even further:
As written, each chip with register 0x07 != 0xa1 will be identified as LM75B.
Even if that was strengthened to actually check if the register value is 0xff,
we have no idea what other vendors might implement in those registers. it would
most certainly mis-identify LM75C as LM75B. Not that it really matters if
the chip _is_ a LM75C, but who knows if other chips fit that identification
pattern.

Overall, my suggestion is to add a small startup script to affected systems
to instantiate the chip directly, and avoid weakening the detect function.
