I still don't want to have the kernel have to rely on this.

Then we have the same situation as today and nothing different happens,
right?

What is a debug option?  We need something "for real".

I agree, but that's not the issue here.

Where can the kernel probing be fixed to use it?  What am I missing that
can be done instead of what this patchset does?

That's not my point, I know sane busses are described in DT :)

That's not the issue/point here at all.  I really could care less about
a console, the issue is that we need a way to take a "generic" arm64
kernel, with a load of modules (i.e. allmodconfig) and have it boot in a
sane amount of time.

Other arches do this today, why can't arm64?  That is the issue here,
not console or late init calls.

I totally agree, and yet here we both are typing on Linux machines where
this all "just works" today.  Now to get that to work on a DT-based
system :)
