It solves the safety case (to some extent) where you need to ensure that one device interaction doesn't conflict with another device interaction. It also solves the problem I've tried to solve with the patch here.

Not precisely what is described here, but I am working on a somewhat generic mechanism for preserving pages across kexec based on this old RFC patch set: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/7/1/211.  I expect to post patches soon.
