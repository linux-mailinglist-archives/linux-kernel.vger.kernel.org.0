This needs actual implementation; we can't advertise it until the kernel k=
nows how to consume the data! It probably should be moved to after the 3/3 =
patch=2E

Implementing this has two parts:

1=2E The kernel needs to be augmented so it can find current objects via i=
ndirection=2E

2=2E And this is the main reason for this in the first place: the early co=
de needs to walk the list and map out the memory areas which are occupied s=
o it doesn't clobber anything; this allows this code to be generic as oppos=
ed to having to know what is a pointer and what size it might point to=2E

(The decompressor didn't need this until kaslr entered the picture, but no=
w it does, sadly=2E)

Optional/future enhancements that might be nice:

3=2E Add some kind of description (e=2Eg=2E foo=3Du64 ; bar=3Dstr ; baz=3D=
blob) to make it possible to write a bootloader that can load these kinds o=
f objects without specific enabling=2E

4=2E Add support for mapping initramfs fragments  this way=2E

5=2E Add support for passingload-on-boot kernel modules=2E

6=2E =2E=2E=2E ?
