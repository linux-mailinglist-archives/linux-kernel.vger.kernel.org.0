Looks ok to me.

Yeah, that would probably be better.

Sounds plausible.

Yep.

Is that something we need?  At least we were able to work around this
limitation with tracepoints' usage of static calls.  But I could see how
it could be useful.

One way to solve that would be a completely different implementation:
have a global trampoline which detects the call site of the caller,
associates it with the given key, schedules some work to patch the call
site later, and then jumps to key->func.  So the first call would
trigger the patching.

Then we might not even need objtool :-)  But it might be tricky to pull
off.
