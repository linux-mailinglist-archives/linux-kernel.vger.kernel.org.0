Hello Dear,

I am Mrs. Mercy Frank, executive office holder, General operation and
regional accountant of Standard Bank of United Kingdom, i believe it's
God's will for me to come across you today, also I hope that you will
not expose or betray this trust and confident that I am about to
impose on you. I have been in search of someone with the same last
name of yours, so when I saw your name, I was pushed to contact you
for our mutual benefit.

One of our customers from your country had a fixed deposit account
with our bank in 2004 that valued the Sum of =C2=A36,300,000.00 (Six
million, Three hundred thousand British pounds). The maturity date for
this deposit was on 2007, unfortunately he was among the death victims
of the May 26th, 2006 earthquake disaster in Jawa, Indonesia that
killed about 5,782 people. He was on a business trip in Indonesia
during this disaster that end up his life and entire family. And he
did not state any next of kin Heir-apparent when the account was
opened, although as his account officer, he told me that he will later
forward one of his relative=E2=80=99s name as his next of kin Heir to the
account which he did not fulfilled before he met his death.

And since then, I have been looking for someone from your country with
similar name. I was happy when i saw your name and I am now seeking
for your co-operation to present you as the next of kin Heir to this
account hence you have similar last name with the deceased. Do not be
afraid, there is no risk involved and every legitimate arrangement to
perfect this deal has been put in place. And for your involvement in
this deal, you will receive 50% of the total amount after the money is
transfer to you. Also for confidentiality in this transaction i will
like us to keep via email for now. Should you consider this offer
interesting, kindly send me the below information of yours completely.

Your complete name:
Your full contact address:
Your direct mobile phone number:
Your major occupation:
Your Age:

Thanks in anticipation of your urgent response.

Best Regards
Mrs. Mercy Frank
