Some maintainers have strong opinions about whether change logs should be:

  (1) only in patch 0
  (2) only in the specific patches that are changed
  (3) both in patch 0 and in the specific patches that are changed.

I can adapt to any of the three styles.  But for style "(1)" please
list which specific patch has changed for each item in the change list.
