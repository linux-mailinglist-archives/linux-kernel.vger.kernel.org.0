Yeah, after sending my reply to Ilya I took a quick look and it _seems_
to be as easy as adding a new encode(require_osd_release...) in the
OSDMap.  And handle the versions, of course.  Let me spend some time
playing with that and I'll try to come up with something during the next
few days.

Thanks for your feedback.
