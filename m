Hey Andi,

I was basing them on the stable branch.

It doesn't apply because of commit 440c4983de262f78033ec58f6abcd199a664327d
(platform/x86: wmi: add context argument to the probe function)

One line change in huawei-wmi.c:
-static int huawei_wmi_probe(struct wmi_device *wdev)
+static int huawei_wmi_probe(struct wmi_device *wdev, const void *context)

I'll address that in the next version. For now, feedback is really
appreciated.
