Not quite nice due to the ignoring of rule 2 noticed by Markus.  There is
actually currently no guarantee that the size is right.  I'm testing a new
version.

I could do this.  One might though think that if someone went to the
trouble of computing +=, these would be cases that we don't want to
change?  Still, it's not problem to add all assignment operators.

Sure, I'll do that when all this is working.  I didn't want those results
to drown out these ones.
