I'll see how x86 runs the same testcase, I thought that playing
cacheline ping-pong is not the optimal use case for any CPU.

My assumption was that x86 probably doesn't suffer that much because
of cpu_relax() -> pause insn could slow down the retry rate.

Not really, as I intentionally did not include a patch and sent this as
RFC.

Agreed, your patch would solve the issue for ThunderX2. Limiting the
retry attempts was one of the things I tried beside extending the number
of NOPs in cpu_relax().
