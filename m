Minor nit. Please also add PATCH to the subject line. Something like 
[PATCH v2]

Also will suggest to wait for atleast a couple of days before sending a 
new version of the patchset so as to give sufficient time for reviews to 
happen.

Note that we normally have two dimensions to this (and similar) 
problem(s) - time we spend in relocating the kernel + initramfs v/s the 
memory space we reserve while enabling kexeckernel (in this case) in the 
primary kernel.

Just to give you an example, I have to shrink even the crashkernel 
reservation size in the primary kernel on arm64 systems running fedora 
which have very small memory footprint. I have a amazon ec2 (aarch64) 
for example which runs with 256M memory space and even enabling 
crashkernel on the same was quite a challenge :)

In such a case we need to do a comparison between the space we reserve 
v/s the time we spend while relocating while doing a kexec load.

Note that we recently had issues with OOM in crashkernel boot, because 
of which we had to introduce kernel command-line parameter to allow a 
user to disable device dump to reduce memory usage, see the following 
commit:

a3a3031b384f ("vmcore: Add a kernel parameter novmcoredd")

More on the same below ...

... may be its time to explore this path now with a fresh mind. I know 
Pratyush tried a bit on this and now I am experimenting on the same on 
several aarch64 systems, mainly because we are really short on memory 
resources on several aarch64 systems (used in embedded/cloud domain) and 
frequently run into OOM issues even in the primary kernel.

Some more comments below:

1. I recommend protecting this code under a CONFIG (CONFIG_FAST_KEXEC ?) 
option and make it dependent on ARM64 being enabled (via CONFIG_ARM64 
option) to avoid causing issues on other archs like s390, powerpc, 
x86_64 (which probably don't need these changes).

Also better to make the CONFIG option disabled by default, so that we 
can avoid OOM issues in primary kernel on arm64 systems with smaller 
memory footprints. A user can enabled it, if he needs fast kexec load 
experience..

2. Also, I don't see timing results for kexec_file_load() in this cover 
letter. Can you add some results for the same here, or are they on 
similar lines?

I will give this a go on some aarch64 systems at my end and come back 
with more on the kernel + initramfs relocation time v/s memory space 
taken up results.

Thanks,
Bhupesh
