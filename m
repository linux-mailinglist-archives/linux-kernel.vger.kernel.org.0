I talked to Bjorn in person at the Embedded Linux Conference over a
week ago about this series. He thinks that this series should go through

is fine. I just want to make sure that this series gets picked up for
the following merge window.

I just sent out a fix for a compiler error on MIPS as a separate patch:
