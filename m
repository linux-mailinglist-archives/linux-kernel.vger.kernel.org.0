The way that this works on Tegra is that we want to describe multiple
interconnect paths. A typical device will have a read and a write memory
client, which can be separately "tuned". Both of these paths will target
system memory, so they would both technically be "dma-mem" paths. But
that would make it impossible to treat them separately elsewhere.

So we could choose any of them to be the "dma-mem" path, but then we
need to be very careful about defining which one that is, so that
drivers know how to look them up, which is also not really desirable.

One other things we could do is to duplicate one of the entries, so that
we'd have "read", "write" and "dma-mem" interconnect paths, with
"dma-mem" referencing the same path as "read" or "write". That doesn't
sound *too* bad, but it's still a bit of a hack. Having an explicit
description for this sounds much clearer and less error prone to me.
