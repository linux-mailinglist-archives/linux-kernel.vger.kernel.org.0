Explain what causes a  dependency to be incorrectly added.

Is this a bug in the dependency detection code?

Are there cases where the dependency detection code can not reliably determine
whether there truly is a dependency?

Change comment to:
  
  For example, if device-C is a consumer of device-S and they have phandles
  referencing each other in the devicetree, the following could happen:

  1.  Device-S is added first.
        - The bus add_links() callback will (incorrectly) link device-S
          as a consumer of device-C, and device-S will be put in the
          "wait_for_suppliers" list.

  2.  Device-C is added next.
        - All devices in the "wait_for_suppliers" list are retried for linking.
        - Device-S remains linked as a consumer to device-C.
        - The bus add_links() callback will (correctly) try to link device-C as
          a consumer of device-S.
        - The link attempt will fail because it would create a cyclic device
          link, and device-C will be put in the "wait_for_suppliers" list.

  Device-S will not be probed because it is in the "wait_for_suppliers" list.
  Device-C will not be probed because it is in the "wait_for_suppliers" list.

What is "loaded"?  Does that mean the device-C probe succeeds?

What causes device-C to be probed?  The normal processing of -EPROBE_DEFER
devices?

Misleading function name.
Incorrect description.

Does not remove consumer from list wait_for_suppliers.

At best, consumer might eventually get removed from list wait_for_suppliers
if device_link_check_waiting_consumers() is called again.

For the purposes of the following paragraphs, I refer to dev as "dev_1" to
distinguish it from a new dev that will be encountered later.  The following
paragraphs assume dev_1 has a supplier dependency for a supplier that has
not probed yet.

Q. Why the extra level of indirection?

A. really_probe() does not set dev->driver before returning if
   device_links_check_suppliers() returned -EPROBE_DEFER.  Thus
   device_link_check_waiting_consumers() can not directly check
   "if (dev_1->driver->edit_links)".

   The added driver_probe_device() code is setting dev_1->has_edit_links in the
   probe path, then device_link_check_waiting_consumers() will use the value
   of dev_1->has_edit_links instead of directly checking
   "if (dev_1->driver->edit_links)".

   If really_probe() was modified to set dev->driver in this
   case then the need for dev->has_edit_links is removed and
   driver_edit_links() is not needed, since dev->driver would
   be available.  Removing driver_edit_links() simplifies the
   code.

device_add() calls dev_1->bus->add_links(dev_1), thus dev_1 will have the
supplier links set (for any suppliers not currently available) and be on
list wait_for_suppliers.

Then device_add() calls bus_probe_device(), leading to calling
driver_probe_device().  The above code fragment either sets
dev_1->has_edit_links or removes the needs_suppliers links from dev_1.
dev_1 remains on list wait_for_suppliers.

If (drv->edit_links(dev_1) returns 0 then device_link_remove_from_wfs()
removes the supplier links.  Shouldn't device_link_remove_from_wfs()  also
remove the device from the list wait_for_suppliers?

The next time a device is added, device_link_check_waiting_consumers() will
be called and dev_1 will be on list wait_for_suppliers, thus
device_link_check_waiting_consumers() will find dev_1->has_edit_links true
and thus call driver_edit_links() instead of calling dev->bus->add_links().

The comment in device.h, later in this patch, says that drv->edit_links() is
responsible for editing the device links for dev.  The comment provides no
guidance on how drv->edit_links() is supposed to determine what edits to
perform.  No example drv->edit_links() function is provided in this patch
series.  dev_1->bus->add_links(dev_1) may have added one or more suppliers
to its needs_suppliers link.  drv->edit_links() needs to be able to handle
all possible variants of what suppliers are on the needs_suppliers link.

Where is the value of field edit_links set?

Is it only in an out of tree driver?  If so, I would like to see an
example implementation of the edit_links() function.
