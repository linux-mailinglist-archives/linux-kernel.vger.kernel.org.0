Hi Arnaldo,

Since this patch contains lines longer than 998 characters, I can't
send the big patch via 'git send-email'.

We will apply for an account on kernel.org to provide git pull request.
But it need to wait for long time.

Could you let me to send this patch by attachment to you?
I attached the v2 patch as an attachment in this mail.
Thanks very much for accepting it.

Haiyan Song
