You can read the current printk ringbuffer this way also because the
ASCII strings are sorted and separated by struct binary data. The binary
parts of the structs can even prove useful in this case to act as record
separators.

        dump_area(log_buf, log_buf_len);

Note: To test this, I modified your dump_area() to call trace_printk()
instead of printk().

The _raw_ contents of the ringbuffer I am proposing (dataring.data) is
nearly identical to that of the current ringbuffer. Its raw data is also
sorted and separated by non-ascii data. So using:

        dump_area(prb->dr.data, 1 << prb->dr.size_bits);

produces essentially the same results. Both ringbuffers are structuring
the data similar to yours, but they have the advantage of writer
synchronization.

What is missing is a way for the raw data buffers to be fixed to a
specified address so that they can be recovered after a reset. I will
look into such a feature for my next version.

On a side note, I'm not sure sure if we want kernel code to do the ASCII
dump of the raw buffer. A userspace application grabbing from /dev/mem
might be more desirable. I can imagine that all kinds of "intelligence"
could be added to such an application to try to recover/sanitize as much
meta-data as possible (such as timestamps, CPU ID, task ID, etc). Maybe
we should add CRC or ECC to struct prink_log. :-)
