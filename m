Another solution would be to have the device tree provide a hint for the
actual flash chip. There would be multiple entries in the spi_nor_ids 
with the
same flash id. By default the first one is used (keeping the current
behaviour). If there is for example

   compatible = "jedec,spi-nor", "w25q32jwq";

the flash_info for the w25q32jwq will be chosen.

I know this will conflict with the new rule that there should only be

   compatible = "jedec,spi-nor";

without the actual flash chip. But it seems that it is not always 
possible
to just use the jedec id to match the correct chip.

Also see for example mx25l25635_post_bfpt_fixups() which tries to figure
out different behaviour by looking at "some" SFDP data. In this case we
might have been lucky, but I fear that this won't work in all cases and
for older flashes it won't work at all.

BTW I do not suggest to add the strings to the the spi_nor_dev_ids[].

I guess that would be a less invasive way to fix different flashes with
same jedec ids.
