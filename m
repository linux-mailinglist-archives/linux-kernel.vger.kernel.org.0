As mentioned before, that's not it.  The problem is that we're feeding
UTF8 into Sphinx as an ordinary str, then sphinx is trying to decode it
as ASCII. The attached hack makes things work.

Kees, I can either just keep this fix (breaking bisectability of the docs
build :) or you can send a new version - up to you.

Thanks,

Subject: [PATCH] docs: make maintainers_include work with Python 2

The MAINTAINERS file contains UTF-8 data, so Python 2 code has to be
explicit about moving it into the Unicode realm.  Explicitly decode all
data from the file as soon as we read it.

This hack can go away once we deprecate Python 2 support.
