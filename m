Ordinarily I would hope that the patch was motivated by observed
behaviour so you have a metric for goodness. However, for NUMA balancing
I would typically run basic workloads first -- dbench, tbench, netperf,
hackbench and pipetest. The objective would be to measure the degree
automatic NUMA balancing is interfering with a basic workload to see if
they patch reduces the number of minor faults incurred even though there
is no NUMA balancing to be worried about. This measures the general
overhead of a patch. If your reasoning is correct, you'd expect lower
overhead.

For balancing itself, I usually look at Andrea's original autonuma
benchmark, NAS Parallel Benchmark (D class usually although C class for
much older or smaller machines) and spec JBB 2005 and 2015. Of the JBB
benchmarks, 2005 is usually more reasonable for evaluating NUMA balancing
than 2015 is (which can be unstable for a variety of reasons). In this
case, I would be looking at whether the overhead is reduced, whether the
ratio of local hits is the same or improved and the primary metric of
each (time to completion for Andrea's and NAS, throughput for JBB).

Even if there is no change to locality and the primary metric but there
is less scanning and overhead overall, it would still be an improvement.

If you have trouble doing such an evaluation, I'll queue tests if they
are based on a patch that addresses the specific point of concern (scan
period not updated) as it's still not obvious why flipping the logic of
whether shared or private is considered was necessary.
