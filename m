Not expanding the syscon binding is the point about not having a #*-cells:
In the examples that Orson listed, the cell count would always be
specific to the user of the syscon regmap, and not interpreted by the
syscon itself.

I think generally speaking this would be useful for random registers that
logically belong to one device but are grouped with other unrelated
registers in a syscon, and that are in a different register offset for
each chip that has them. Using named properties instead of a list
of phandle/arg tuples with names is clearly a simpler alternative
and more like we do it today, but I can also see some API simplification
with Orson's patch without the binding getting out of hand.
