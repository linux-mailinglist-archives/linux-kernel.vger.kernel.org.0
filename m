Okay, I see.  This sounds like a problem of communication between 
userspace and the kernel driver; you want to tell the driver to bind 
only to a specific device that is distinguishable only by its path.

In fact, there already is a way to do this in the kernel: write to the
sysfs "bind" file.  The difficulty is that you can't force a driver to
bind to an interface if it doesn't believe it is compatible with the
interface.  And if the driver believes it is compatible, it will
automatically attempt to bind with all such interfaces regardless of
their path.

Perhaps what you need is a usb_device_id flag to indicate that the 
entry should never be used for automatic matches -- only for matches 
made by the user via the "bind" file.  Greg KH would probably be 
willing to accept a new USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_NO_AUTO flag, which 
could be included in your unusual_devs.h entries.

This isn't an issue if you rely on sysfs-directed binding.  You write 
the name of the specific interface to the "bind" file.

No.  But with the NO_AUTO flag in your match flags, this wouldn't 
matter.  Besides, the IDs you want to add aren't really dynamic -- they 
are fixed and known in advance.

Try something like the patch below (completely untested).  You'd
probably divide this up into two separate patches for submission: one
for the NO_AUTO flag and one to modify usb-storage.
