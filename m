The problem is, although it is not used in your configs, it can be selected, and
fwiw some defconfigs in mainline have it enabled, i.e the arm64 defconfig.

I think you're testing the patch on x86 but I suspect we want also the notifier
on some arm64 platforms (like kevin) right? In such case I won't get the
notifier because CONFIG_OF and CONFIG_ACPI is enabled on my defconfig.

My guess is that the logic should be if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_OF) call
cros_ec_check_features, otherwise ACPI will do the magic instead of
(!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ACPI))
