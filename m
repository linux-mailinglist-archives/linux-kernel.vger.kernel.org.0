I don't quite understand what you mean by "isn't a mandatory dependency"
here. I think IIUC, what Rob said will solve the probe order problem,
correct?

Is there a problem if we split this in two and handle the
late_initcall_sync() + regulators separately and solve the probe ordering
here as suggested above?

I know the original intention of the series is to resolve the
late_initcall_sync() assumption and probe order was a "side-effect". However,
I think probing in the dependency order is still extremely valuable and can
resolve boot time issues ahead of time.

Agree and it is going to immediately conflict with 'power-supply' for
example. If we are going this route, then we need to fix and agree on
standard regulator bindings too and make the changes everywhere in the
kernel.

Is the summary here that we need to figure out a different approach / fix
regulator framework, or something else ? It wasn't clear from all other
emails from this thread, sorry for noise if I missed it.
