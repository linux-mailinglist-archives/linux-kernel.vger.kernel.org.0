And looking at this with a more awake brain, the root cause is pretty
obvious.

sched_clock() advances by 24 seconds, but clock MONOTONIC on which the
watchdog timer is based does not. As the timestamps you printed have 7
trailing zeros, it's pretty clear that timekeeping is still jiffies
based at this point and HZ is set to 100.

So while bringing up the non-boot CPUs the boot CPU loses ~2000 timer
interrupts. That needs to be fixed and not papered over.

Thanks,
