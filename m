This is the only LaTeX documentation file inside the documentation.

Instead of having a Latex document directly there, convert
it to ReST format, as this is the format we're using for docs.

For now, let's keep the extension as .txt in order to avoid
warnings when building the documentation with Sphinx.

The next patch patch will rename it to .rst and add it to the
building system.

 manufacturers adopted an existing electrical interface and changed

 interfaces (Aztech, Sanyo, Funai, Vertos, Longshine, Optics Storage and

 drives are either IDE/ATAPI or SCSI, and it is very unlikely that any
 manufacturer will create a new interface. Even finding drives for the
 old proprietary interfaces is getting difficult.
 
 When (in the 1.3.70's) I looked at the existing software interface,
-which was expressed through \cdromh, it appeared to be a rather wild

 others do not. Some drivers lock the door upon opening the device, to
 prevent an incoherent file system, but others don't, to allow software
 ejection. Undoubtedly, the capabilities of the different drives vary,
 but even when two drives have the same capability their drivers'
 behavior was usually different.

+I decided to start a discussion on how to make all the Linux CD-ROM
 drivers behave more uniformly. I began by contacting the developers of
-the many \cdrom\ drivers found in the \linux\ kernel. Their reactions

-describe. The implementation of the \UCD\ is in the file \cdromc. This
-driver is intended to be an additional software layer that sits on top
-of the low-level device drivers for each \cdrom\ drive. By adding this
-additional layer, it is possible to have all the different \cdrom\

-programmer's interface defined in \cdromh. This guide was written to

+Standardizing through another software level
+============================================
 
 At the time this document was conceived, all drivers directly
-implemented the \cdrom\ $ioctl()$ calls through their own routines. This
+implemented the CD-ROM *ioctl()* calls through their own routines. This
 led to the danger of different drivers forgetting to do important things
 like checking that the user was giving the driver valid data. More
 importantly, this led to the divergence of behavior, which has already
 been discussed.
 
-For this reason, the \UCD\ was created to enforce consistent \cdrom\
-drive behavior, and to provide a common set of services to the various
-low-level \cdrom\ device drivers. The \UCD\ now provides another
-software-level, that separates the $ioctl()$ and $open()$ implementation
+For this reason, the Uniform CD-ROM Driver was created to enforce consistent
+CD-ROM drive behavior, and to provide a common set of services to the various
+low-level CD-ROM device drivers. The Uniform CD-ROM Driver now provides another
+software-level, that separates the *ioctl()* and *open()* implementation
 from the actual hardware implementation. Note that this effort has
 made few changes which will affect a user's application programs. The
 greatest change involved moving the contents of the various low-level
-\cdrom\ drivers' header files to the kernel's cdrom directory. This was

+=========================================================
+
+Traditionally, Unix devices can be used in two different `modes`,
 either by reading/writing to the device file, or by issuing
-controlling commands to the device, by the device's $ioctl()$
-call. The problem with \cdrom\ drives, is that they can be used for
+controlling commands to the device, by the device's *ioctl()*
+call. The problem with CD-ROM drives, is that they can be used for
 two entirely different purposes. One is to mount removable
-file systems, \cdrom s, the other is to play audio CD's. Audio commands
-are implemented entirely through $ioctl$s, presumably because the
+file systems, CD-ROM's, the other is to play audio CD's. Audio commands

+*Ioctl*s routed through *audio_ioctl()*
+---------------------------------------
 
-\subsubsection{New $ioctl$s in \cdromc}
+The following set of *ioctl()'s* are all implemented through a call to
+the *cdrom_fops* function *audio_ioctl()*. Memory checks and
+allocation are performed in *cdrom_ioctl()*, and also sanitization of
+address format (*CDROM_LBA*/*CDROM_MSF*) is done.
 
-The following $ioctl$s have been introduced to allow user programs to
-control the behavior of individual \cdrom\ devices. New $ioctl$
+`CDROMSUBCHNL`
+	Get sub-channel data in argument *arg* of type
+	`struct cdrom_subchnl *`.
+`CDROMREADTOCHDR`
+	Read Table of Contents header, in *arg* of type
+	`struct cdrom_tochdr *`.
+`CDROMREADTOCENTRY`
+	Read a Table of Contents entry in *arg* and specified by *arg*
+	of type `struct cdrom_tocentry *`.
+`CDROMPLAYMSF`
+	Play audio fragment specified in Minute, Second, Frame format,
+	delimited by *arg* of type `struct cdrom_msf *`.
+`CDROMPLAYTRKIND`
+	Play audio fragment in track-index format delimited by *arg*
+	of type `struct cdrom_ti *`.
+`CDROMVOLCTRL`
+	Set volume specified by *arg* of type `struct cdrom_volctrl *`.
+`CDROMVOLREAD`
+	Read volume into by *arg* of type `struct cdrom_volctrl *`.
+`CDROMSTART`
+	Spin up disc.
+`CDROMSTOP`
+	Stop playback of audio fragment.
+`CDROMPAUSE`
+	Pause playback of audio fragment.
+`CDROMRESUME`
+	Resume playing.
+
+New *ioctl()'s* in `cdrom.c`
+----------------------------
+
+The following *ioctl()'s* have been introduced to allow user programs to
+control the behavior of individual CD-ROM devices. New *ioctl*
 commands can be identified by the underscores in their names.
-\begin{description}
-\item[CDROM_SET_OPTIONS] Set options specified by $arg$. Returns the
-option flag register after modification. Use  $arg = \rm0$ for reading
-the current flags.
-\item[CDROM_CLEAR_OPTIONS] Clear options specified by $arg$. Returns
-  the option flag register after modification.
-\item[CDROM_SELECT_SPEED] Select head-rate speed of disc specified as
-  by $arg$ in units of standard cdrom speed (176\,kB/sec raw data or
-  150\,kB/sec file system data). The value 0 means `auto-select', \ie,
-  play audio discs at real time and data discs at maximum speed. The value
-  $arg$ is checked against the maximum head rate of the drive found in the
-  $cdrom_dops$.
-\item[CDROM_SELECT_DISC] Select disc numbered $arg$ from a juke-box.
-  First disc is numbered 0. The number $arg$ is checked against the
-  maximum number of discs in the juke-box found in the $cdrom_dops$.
-\item[CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED] Returns 1 if a disc has been changed since
-  the last call. Note that calls to $cdrom_media_changed$ by the VFS
-  are treated by an independent queue, so both mechanisms will detect
-  a media change once. For juke-boxes, an extra argument $arg$
-  specifies the slot for which the information is given. The special
-  value $CDSL_CURRENT$ requests that information about the currently
-  selected slot be returned.
-\item[CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS] Returns the status of the drive by a call to
-  $drive_status()$. Return values are defined in section~\ref{drive
-   status}. Note that this call doesn't return information on the
-  current playing activity of the drive; this can be polled through an
-  $ioctl$ call to $CDROMSUBCHNL$. For juke-boxes, an extra argument
-  $arg$ specifies the slot for which (possibly limited) information is
-  given. The special value $CDSL_CURRENT$ requests that information
-  about the currently selected slot be returned.
-\item[CDROM_DISC_STATUS] Returns the type of the disc currently in the
-  drive.  It should be viewed as a complement to $CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS$.
-  This $ioctl$ can provide \emph {some} information about the current
-  disc that is inserted in the drive.  This functionality used to be
-  implemented in the low level drivers, but is now carried out
-  entirely in \UCD.
-  
-  The history of development of the CD's use as a carrier medium for
-  various digital information has lead to many different disc types.
-  This $ioctl$ is useful only in the case that CDs have \emph {only
-    one} type of data on them.  While this is often the case, it is
-  also very common for CDs to have some tracks with data, and some
-  tracks with audio.  Because this is an existing interface, rather
-  than fixing this interface by changing the assumptions it was made
-  under, thereby breaking all user applications that use this
-  function, the \UCD\ implements this $ioctl$ as follows: If the CD in
-  question has audio tracks on it, and it has absolutely no CD-I, XA,
-  or data tracks on it, it will be reported as $CDS_AUDIO$.  If it has
-  both audio and data tracks, it will return $CDS_MIXED$.  If there
-  are no audio tracks on the disc, and if the CD in question has any
-  CD-I tracks on it, it will be reported as $CDS_XA_2_2$.  Failing
-  that, if the CD in question has any XA tracks on it, it will be
-  reported as $CDS_XA_2_1$.  Finally, if the CD in question has any
-  data tracks on it, it will be reported as a data CD ($CDS_DATA_1$).
 
-  This $ioctl$ can return:
-  $$
-  \halign{$#$\ \hfil&$/*$ \rm# $*/$\hfil\cr
-    CDS_NO_INFO& no information available\cr
-    CDS_NO_DISC& no disc is inserted, or tray is opened\cr
-    CDS_AUDIO& Audio disc (2352 audio bytes/frame)\cr
-    CDS_DATA_1& data disc, mode 1 (2048 user bytes/frame)\cr
-    CDS_XA_2_1& mixed data (XA), mode 2, form 1 (2048 user bytes)\cr
-    CDS_XA_2_2& mixed data (XA), mode 2, form 1 (2324  user bytes)\cr
-    CDS_MIXED& mixed audio/data disc\cr
-    }
-  $$
-  For some information concerning frame layout of the various disc
-  types, see a recent version of \cdromh.
+`CDROM_SET_OPTIONS`
+	Set options specified by *arg*. Returns the option flag register
+	after modification. Use *arg = \rm0* for reading the current flags.
+`CDROM_CLEAR_OPTIONS`
+	Clear options specified by *arg*. Returns the option flag register
+	after modification.
+`CDROM_SELECT_SPEED`

+	i. e., play audio discs at real time and data discs at maximum speed.
+	The value *arg* is checked against the maximum head rate of the
+	drive found in the *cdrom_dops*.
+`CDROM_SELECT_DISC`
+	Select disc numbered *arg* from a juke-box.
 
-\item[CDROM_CHANGER_NSLOTS] Returns the number of slots in a
-  juke-box. 
-\item[CDROMRESET] Reset the drive. 
-\item[CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY] Returns the $capability$ flags for the
-  drive. Refer to section \ref{capability} for more information on
-  these flags.
-\item[CDROM_LOCKDOOR] Locks the door of the drive. $arg == \rm0$
-  unlocks the door, any other value locks it.
-\item[CDROM_DEBUG] Turns on debugging info. Only root is allowed
-  to do this. Same semantics as CDROM_LOCKDOOR.

+
+How to update your driver
+=========================
+
+- Make a backup of your current driver.
+- Get hold of the files `cdrom.c` and `cdrom.h`, they should be in
   the directory tree that came with this documentation.
-\item Make sure you include \cdromh.
-\item Change the 3rd argument of $register_blkdev$ from
-$\&<your-drive>_fops$ to $\&cdrom_fops$. 
-\item Just after that line, add the following to register with the \UCD:
-  $$register_cdrom(\&<your-drive>_info);$$
-  Similarly, add a call to $unregister_cdrom()$ at the appropriate place.
-\item Copy an example of the device-operations $struct$ to your
-  source, \eg, from {\tt {cm206.c}} $cm206_dops$, and change all
+- Make sure you include `cdrom.h`.
+- Change the 3rd argument of *register_blkdev* from `&<your-drive>_fops`

+- Just after that line, add the following to register with the Uniform
+  CD-ROM Driver::
+
+	register_cdrom(&<your-drive>_info);*
+
+  Similarly, add a call to *unregister_cdrom()* at the appropriate place.
+- Copy an example of the device-operations *struct* to your
+  source, e. g., from `cm206.c` *cm206_dops*, and change all
   entries to names corresponding to your driver, or names you just
   happen to like. If your driver doesn't support a certain function,
-  make the entry $NULL$. At the entry $capability$ you should list all
+  make the entry *NULL*. At the entry *capability* you should list all
   capabilities your driver currently supports. If your driver
   has a capability that is not listed, please send me a message.
-\item Copy the $cdrom_device_info$ declaration from the same example
+- Copy the *cdrom_device_info* declaration from the same example
   driver, and modify the entries according to your needs. If your
   driver dynamically determines the capabilities of the hardware, this
-  structure should also be declared dynamically. 
-\item Implement all functions in your $<device>_dops$ structure,
-  according to prototypes listed in \cdromh, and specifications given
-  in section~\ref{cdrom.c}. Most likely you have already implemented

+- Implement all functions in your `<device>_dops` structure,
+  according to prototypes listed in  `cdrom.h`, and specifications given
+  in cdrom_api_. Most likely you have already implemented
   the code in a large part, and you will almost certainly need to adapt the
   prototype and return values.
-\item Rename your $<device>_ioctl()$ function to $audio_ioctl$ and

   change the prototype a little. Remove entries listed in the first
-  part in section~\ref{cdrom-ioctl}, if your code was OK, these are
