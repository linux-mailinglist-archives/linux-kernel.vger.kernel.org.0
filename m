In this case I believe the idea is exactly like you said. The OpRegion
would just be SystemIO OpRegion instead of SystemMemory OpRegion, and
the _DSD may or may not do something.

The goal appears to be to be able to support the same UCSI device
driver (in Windows) regardless of which component actually supplies
the interface (USB PD controller, EC firmware...), and regardless how
that component is attached to the SOC (I2C, PCI, mailbox...). The real
hardware is meant to be hidden in AML. The problem with that is of
course that UCSI now always depends on ACPI.

I think the main problem is that the mailbox was never separated from
the UCSI interface like it should have. If the ACPI mailbox was
separated from the interface (or generalized) it could have been
handled as a bus in the operating system, fake bus that looks like
SMBus (or I2C). We would have needed a separate "fake I2C host
adapter" driver for the mailbox, but now if a real USB PD controller
I2C slave device supplies the UCSI interface (most of them are I2C
slave devices), the same UCSI driver would still work without any
changes needed.

But I guess it's too late to change that now :-(.
