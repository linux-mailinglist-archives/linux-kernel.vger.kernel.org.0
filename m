Tracepoint users should issue "tracepoint_synchronize_unregister()" rather than
expect tracepoints to rely on RCU.

I cannot find a good reason for perf to issue a redundant rcu_read_lock/unlock from
a tracepoint probe already providing RCU or SRCU synchronization. Same goes for BPF.
If they _really_ need to do it, then they could implement their own idle probes
which do an additional rcu_irq_enter/exit_irqson(), but this work-around does not
belong in tracepoint.h.

If out-of-tree modules fail to use the API properly, the burden of getting fixed
is on their shoulders, as it has always been.

Thanks,

Mathieu
