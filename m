Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] Genericize DW MIPI DSI bridge and add i.MX 6 driver

Having a generic Synopsis DesignWare MIPI-DSI host controller bridge
driver is a very good idea, however the current implementation has
hardcoded quite a lot of the register layouts used by the two supported
SoC vendors, STM and Rockchip, which use IP cores v1.30 and v1.31.

This makes it hard to support other SoC vendors like the FSL/NXP i.MX 6
which use older v1.01 cores or future versions because, based on history,
layout changes should also be expected in new DSI versions / SoCs.

This patch series converts the bridge and platform drivers to access
registers via generic regmap APIs then, adds support for the host
controller found on i.MX 6.

I only have i.MX hardware with MIPI-DSI panel and relevant documentation
available for testing so I'll really appreciate it if someone could test
the series on Rockchip and STM... eyeballing register fields could only
get me so far, so sorry in advance for any breakage!

Many thanks to Boris Brezillon <boris.brezillon@collabora.com> for
suggesting the regmap solution and to Liu Ying <Ying.Liu@freescale.com>
for doing the initial i.MX platform driver implementation.

This series applies on top of latest linux-next tree, next-20191106.

v1 -> v2:
  * Moved the register definitions & regmap initialization into the
  bridge module as suggested by Emil. Platform drivers can get the
  regmap via their plat_data after calling the bridge probe() without
  worrying at all about layouts, which are handled by the bridge now.
