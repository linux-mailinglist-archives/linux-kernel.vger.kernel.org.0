indeed, chiptop should not have any child nodes (based on your explanation).
I was referring to VRX200 where the RCU syscon has various children
(one child node for each hardware module that's part of RCU: reset
controller, 2x USB PHY, ...)

back to LGM:
you said that the LGM RCU registers only contain the reset controller.
thus I see no need for the syscon compatible
