Adding the EFI stub on arm64 required very careful consideration of our
Image header and the EFI spec, along with the PE/COFF spec.

For example, to be a compliant PE/COFF header, the first two bytes of
your kernel image need to be "MZ" in ASCII. On arm64 we happened to find
a valid instruction that we could rely upon that met this requirement...

... but it's not clear to me if this instruction meets that requriement.

I would strongly encourage you to consider what you actually need for a
compliant EFI header before you set the rest of this ABI in stone.

On arm64 we also had issues with endianness, and I would strongly
recommend that you define how big/little endian will work ahead of time.
e.g. whether fields are always in a fixed endianness.

Thanks,
Mark.
