Hi all,

statsfs is a proposal for a new Linux kernel synthetic filesystem, to be
mounted in /sys/kernel/stats, which exposes subsystem-level statistics
in sysfs.  Reading need not be particularly lightweight, but writing
must be fast.  Therefore, statistics are gathered at a fine-grain level
in order to avoid locking or atomic operations, and then aggregated by
statsfs until the desired granularity.

The first user of statsfs would be KVM, which is currently exposing its
stats in debugfs.  However, debugfs access is now limited by the
security lock down patches, and in addition statsfs aims to be a
more-or-less stable API, hence the idea of making it a separate
filesystem and mount point.

A few people have already expressed interest in this.  Christian
Borntraeger presented on the kvm_stat tool recently at KVM Forum and was
also thinking about using some high-level API in debugfs.  Google has
KVM patches to gather statistics in a binary format; it may be useful to
add this kind of functionality (and some kind of introspection similar
to what tracing does) to statsfs too in the future, but this is
independent from the kernel API.  I'm also CCing Alex Williamson, in
case VFIO is interested in something similar, and Steven Rostedt because
apparently he has enough free time to write poetry in addition to code.

There are just two concepts in statsfs, namely "values" (aka files) and
"sources" (directories).

A value represents a single quantity that is gathered by the statsfs
client.  It could be the number of vmexits of a given kind, the amount
of memory used by some data structure, the length of the longest hash
table chain, or anything like that.

Values are described by a struct like this one:

	struct statsfs_value {
		const char *name;
		enum stat_type type;	/* STAT_TYPE_{BOOL,U64,...} */
		u16 aggr_kind;		/* Bitmask with zero or more of
					 * STAT_AGGR_{MIN,MAX,SUM,...}
					 */
		u16 mode;		/* File mode */
		int offset;		/* Offset from base address
					 * to field containing the value
					 */
	};

As you can see, values are basically integers stored somewhere in a
struct.   The statsfs_value struct also includes information on which
operations (for example sum, min, max, average, count nonzero) it makes
sense to expose when the values are aggregated.

Sources form the bulk of the statsfs API.  They can include two kinds of
elements:

- values as described above.  The common case is to have many values
with the same base address, which are represented by an array of struct
statsfs_value

- subordinate sources

Adding a subordinate source has two effects:

- it creates a subdirectory for each subordinate source

- for each value in the subordinate sources which has aggr_kind != 0,
corresponding values will be created in the parent directory too.  If
multiple subordinate sources are backed by the same array of struct
statsfs_value, values from all those sources will be aggregated.  That
is, statsfs will compute these from the values of all items in the list
and show them in the parent directory.

Writable values can only be written with a value of zero. Writing zero
to an aggregate zeroes all the corresponding values in the subordinate
sources.

Sources are manipulated with these four functions:

	struct statsfs_source *statsfs_source_create(const char *fmt,
						     ...);
	void statsfs_source_add_values(struct statsfs_source *source,
				       struct statsfs_value *stat,
				       int n, void *ptr);
	void statsfs_source_add_subordinate(
					struct statsfs_source *source,
					struct statsfs_source *sub);
	void statsfs_source_remove_subordinate(
					struct statsfs_source *source,
					struct statsfs_source *sub);

Sources are reference counted, and for this reason there is also a pair
of functions in the usual style:

	void statsfs_source_get(struct statsfs_source *);
	void statsfs_source_put(struct statsfs_source *);

Finally,

	void statsfs_source_register(struct statsfs_source *source);

lets you create a toplevel statsfs directory.

As a practical example, KVM's usage of debugfs could be replaced by
something like this:

/* Globals */
	struct statsfs_value vcpu_stats[] = ...;
	struct statsfs_value vm_stats[] = ...;
	static struct statsfs_source *kvm_source;

/* On module creation */
	kvm_source = statsfs_source_create("kvm");
	statsfs_source_register(kvm_source);

/* On VM creation */
	kvm->src = statsfs_source_create("%d-%d\n",
				         task_pid_nr(current), fd);
	statsfs_source_add_values(kvm->src, vm_stats,
				  ARRAY_SIZE(vm_stats),
				  &kvm->stats);
	statsfs_source_add_subordinate(kvm_source, kvm->src);

/* On vCPU creation */
	vcpu_src = statsfs_source_create("vcpu%d\n", vcpu->vcpu_id);
	statsfs_source_add_values(vcpu_src, vcpu_stats,
				  ARRAY_SIZE(vcpu_stats),
				  &vcpu->stats);
	statsfs_source_add_subordinate(kvm->src, vcpu_src);
	/*
	 * No need to keep the vcpu_src around since there's no
	 * separate vCPU deletion event; rely on refcount
	 * exclusively.
	 */
	statsfs_source_put(vcpu_src);

/* On VM deletion */
	statsfs_source_remove_subordinate(kvm_source, kvm->src);
	statsfs_source_put(kvm->src);

/* On KVM exit */
	statsfs_source_put(kvm_source);

How does this look?

Paolo
