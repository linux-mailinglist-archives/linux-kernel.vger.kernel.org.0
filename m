I'm not sure I follow this: the reason the bzImage currently contains
.bss and a fix for it is in a patch I have out for review at
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200109150218.16544-1-nivedita@alum.mit.edu

This alone shouldn't make much of a difference across compressors. The
entire .bss is just stored uncompressed as 0's in bzImage currently.
The only thing that gets compressed is the original kernel ELF file. Is
the difference above just from this patch, or is it including the
overhead of function-sections?

It is not necessary for it to contain .bss to get the correct init_size.
The latter is calculated (in x86/boot/header.S) based on the offset of
the _end symbol in the compressed vmlinux, so storing the .bss is just a
bug.

I am also confused by this -- the boot heap is not part of the
vmlinux.bin in arch/x86/boot/compressed: that's a stripped copy of the
decompressed kernel, just before we apply the selected compression to it
and vmlinux.relocs.

Do you mean arch/x86/boot/vmlinux.bin? That is an objcopy of
compressed/vmlinux, and it grows in size with increasing .bss for the
same reason as above (rather it's the cause of bzImage growing).
