Is it assigned *by* the EC or *to* the EC.

If it is assigned *by* the EC, can't you ask the EC for it?

I asked this before, but was not given the answer I wanted:

> > Why can't these numbers be assigned at runtime?

Is there a way to call into the EC and request the number?

int cros_ec_allocate_sensor_id(enum cros_sensor_type);

Which allocates the next available ID of the requested type.

OR

If this is not possible AND the sensors of the same type are identical
AND the sensors are always numbered sequentially from the same base
(i.e. 0, 1, 2 OR 1, 2, 3, etc) then you use the ida_ API
(include/linux/idr.h) to provide you with a unique ID for your
sensor(s).

###

The flip side is a situation where the devices of a same type are not
identical and are provided different platform data (by the parent MFD
in this case).  If this true then you may actually need to identify
the specific sensor ahead of time, in which case it's the chosen
nomenclature that is misleading.  What you might really be looking for
is a sensor_id and proper commenting/documentation. 

###

However, looking at this patch, I suspect the former situation to be
the case here, thus there is no requirement for the parent to
pre-allocate 'sensor_num's.
