Fair point. Though at least for the USB5734 hub, I don't believe we've
made use of the i2c on it (at least that I can see).  From the
existing driver, the control is basically just 3 GPIOs:  type-c power,
hub power, and the mux/switch.

Trying to get my head around your suggestion:
ctrl {
    mux-controls = <&usb_gpio_mux>;
    connector@0 {
        // type C connector binding
    };
    hub@1 {
        // USB device binding
    };
};

The usb_gpio_mux would be the gpio mux switch.

For the "type C connector binding", that would probably be the rt1711h
type-c chip.

For the "USB device binding" that would be a yet to be implemented
USB5734 hub driver, I'm guessing?

Though I'm not sure I understand how the hub driver gets a signal to
power-on/power-off its gpio-regulator from the mux state?  I'm maybe
still missing some details on the mux infrastructure.

So this is a little confusing to me. Why is the host controller
involved?  It seems to me all of this is down-stream of the
controller, and it's just taking whatever the switch gives it.

I think the switch needs to be signalled from the rt1711h type-c
connector (when it detects the cable and determines the role). That
said, I'm not sure how it would think to control the mux in that case
(as that's pretty special case for this specific hardware). That's why
we're using the role notifier intermediary trick in the current code.

So I guess we could still have the roll notifier intermediary driver
which then controls the mux?

I know that's more a driver implementation detail and not really
hardware description, :) but I'm just trying to figure out how it's
going to come together and actually work.

My concern is that I suspect the issue we had then was that the order
and the timing that we switch the 3 GPIOs ends up being important. In
the current implementation we can adjust them linearly together, where
as when I took a stab at having the vbus gpio was modeled as a
regulator and controlled independently by the rt1711h, the typec state
machine would get confused as I'm guessing the mux/switch wasn't where
it expected it to be when it wanted to change the state of the type-c
vbus.

Thoughts?

Thanks again for the review and feedback. And sorry to let so much
time (and mental context) pass.
