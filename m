This all looks good to me. I'll plan to merge these into the testing
branch soon, and tag them for stable.

PS: On a related note (and more of a question for Ilya)...

I'm wondering if we get any benefit from having our own ceph_kvmalloc
routine. Why are we not better off using the stock kvmalloc routine
instead? Forcing a vmalloc just because we've gone above 32k allocation
doesn't seem like the right thing to do.

PPS: I also wonder if we ought to put a might_sleep() in kvfree(). I
think that kfree generally doesn't, and I wonder how many uses of this
end up using kfree until memory ends up fragmented.
