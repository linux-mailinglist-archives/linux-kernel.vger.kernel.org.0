Sure.  A problem with leaving it in place is that this leads people to
assume it is tested, which it presumably is not.

I don't think there's any particular downside either way, really.  But
it's presently cruft so I'm inclined to remove it.  If someone has a
need then they can add it back (presumbly reimplement it, actually) and
test it then.
