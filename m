Sorry to skip over a large part of your response. The discussion in this

Please be more specific. If the protected workload is mostly in-memory,
I do not really see how IO controller is relevant. See the example of
the DB setup I've mentioned elsewhere.

No, I am just saying and as explained in reply to Johannes, there are
practical cases where the cgroup hierarchy reflects organizational
structure as well.
