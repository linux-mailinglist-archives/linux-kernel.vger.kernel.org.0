Subject: [PATCH 3/6] dt-bindings: mailbox: add bindings to support ARM MHU doorbells
Date:   Fri, 31 May 2019 15:33:17 +0100

The ARM MHU has mechanism to assert interrupt signals to facilitate
inter-processor message based communication. It drives the signal using
a 32-bit register, with all 32-bits logically ORed together. It also
enables software to set, clear and check the status of each of the bits
of this register independently. Each bit of the register can be
associated with a type of event that can contribute to raising the
interrupt thereby allowing it to be used as independent doorbells.

Since the first version of this binding can't support doorbells,
this patch extends the existing binding to support them by allowing
"#mbox-cells" to be 2.

+The MHU drives the interrupt signal using a 32-bit register, with all
+32-bits logically ORed together. It provides a set of registers to
