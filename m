I don't see libperf in my Debian testing installation, but I did find
libbpf.

Looking at the libbpf Makefile, it is getting the version from the
libbpf.map file.

What's the standard way for distributions to know when to use the
number? Only from Linux stable trees? That way, we can make fixes to the
library, but still need to remember to update the version number before
the release.

How does libbpf handle the version numbers with bug fixes? Does it get
updated one a kernel release if there are changes?

Obviously, we need to update the major number if the API changes in
anyway that is not compatible for a new application, which includes
adding new functions. Right?
