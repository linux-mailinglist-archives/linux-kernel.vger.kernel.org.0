As far as i remember i also need the linked patchset but it does not help completely.
As far is i remember overwriting the timings didn't help because that's the first thing
i tried without the other patches.

I have not tried this yet because i have written out the values calculated by the driver.
My hope is that the error made in the timings can be deduced from the values below.

 As assumed the timings are not correct. But there is one more thing, the timing calculation is being called twice!
