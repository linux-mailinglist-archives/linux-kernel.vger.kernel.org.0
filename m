Thanks for reviewing the patch.

The RNG on Aspeed hardware allows eight different modes for combining 
its four internal Ring Oscillators that together generate a stream of 
random bits. However, the timeriomem-rng driver does not allow for mode 
selection so, the Aspeed RNG with this generic driver runs always on 
mode 'seven' (The default value for mode according to the AspeedTech 
datasheets).

I've performed some testings on this Aspeed RNG using the NIST 
Statistical Test Suite (NIST 800-22r1a) and, the results I got show that 
the default mode 'seven' isn't producing the best entropy and linear 
rank when compared against the other modes available on these SOCs.  On 
the other hand, the driver that I'm proposing here allows for mode 
selection which would help improve the random output for those looking 
to get the best out of this Aspeed RNG.

Thanks and regards,

Oscar A Perez
