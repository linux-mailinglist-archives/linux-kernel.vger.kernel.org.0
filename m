Dunno, I think that if kmalloc() starts failing then it's time to give up!

That's an interesting one -- currently there isn't a way to unregister
an emulation hook afaict. We could add unregister_insn_emulation() to
remove the emulation hook from the insn_emulation list and free it, but
I'm actually now starting to prefer your initial patch after all. The only
way these failures will happen are either because the system is doomed
or kmalloc fault injection is being used; so keeping things simple rather
than add rarely executed complexity is probably best.

What do you expect people to do with that information?

Are you ok with me applying your original patch?
