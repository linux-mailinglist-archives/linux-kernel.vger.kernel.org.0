This is for XEN case. Not sure how relevant it is for you.

Right, but rounded to 2M around the place kernel was decompressed to.
Some of reserved areas from the listing below are smaller then 2M or not
aligned to 2M.

Kernel can start in 64-bit mode directly and in this case we inherit page
tables from bootloader/BIOS. They trusted to provide identity mapping to
cover at least kernel (plus some more essential stuff), but it's free to
map more.

It would be interesting to know which of them are problematic.

Are you sure that it's speculative access to blame? Speculative access
must not cause change in architectural state.
