OK.  I understand that this patchset isn't a universal win, so we need
some way to justify it.  I will try to find some application for that.

Another thought, as proposed by David Hildenbrand, it's may be a
universal win to discard clean MADV_FREE pages when migrating if there are
already memory pressure on the target node.  For example, if the free
memory on the target node is lower than high watermark?
