For low kfree_rcu() loads, yes, it increases overhead due to the need
for context switches instead of softirq running at the tail end of an
interrupt.  But for high kfree_rcu() loads, it gets you realtime priority
(in conjunction with "rcutree.kthread_prio=", that is).

I guess this is helping me to prepare for Plumbers.  ;-)
