Afaict the issues were introduced in 5.3, and my first patch (including
a note [complaint if you will] of the second issue) was sent around
5.4-rc2. This has been blocking osstest's linux-linus forever since, so
even without my mail everyone could have been aware by paying attention
to the flight reports (the bisection ones, unfortunately, are pretty
useless here, as in cases like this one they seem to tend to point at
huge merge commits).
