5.5.0.rc1

As I said in the patch series cover-letter, this patch series address following cases/isssues.

There are following issues in arm64 kdump:
1. We use crashkernel=X to reserve crashkernel below 4G, which will fail
when there is no enough low memory.
2. Currently, crashkernel=Y@X can be used to reserve crashkernel above 4G,
in this case, if swiotlb or DMA buffers are required, crash dump kernel
will boot failure because there is no low memory available for allocation.

From your description, you use crashkernel=768M.
There are enough crashkernel below 4G, so crashkernel will be
reserved successfully and kdump be ok. （This case has no DMA buffers issue.）

or you use crashkernel=2024M@35GB, and this case is ok?
If your driver doesn't need DMA buffers(I am not sure about it), kdump will also be ok.


If i understand your question and explain clearly?

Thanks,
Chen Zhou
