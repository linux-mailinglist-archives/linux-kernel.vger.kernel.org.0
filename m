Yes, this was reported on bugzilla.redhat.com, I'll add you to CC list.

I do not know. Yoji, did you hit this bug or did you find it by code
inspection ?

Yes, I thought about this too. I can be easily wrong, please correct me,
but I came to conclusion the old behaviour (no permission check) is fine
security-wise.

could you explain what exactly you do not like wrt mq_notify/exec ?
I must have missed something.

Eric, please feel free to make another fix you like more. I know that
I can't convince you anyway, I won't argue.
Oleg.
