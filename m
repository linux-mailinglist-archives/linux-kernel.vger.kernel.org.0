As of the 3.6 release of the SPDX License List, we will have added =
markup to denote that the name in the disclaimer can be changed and =
still considered a match. This is a common scenario in other licenses =
(like the BSD family), but I don=E2=80=99t think we=E2=80=99d come =
across it until the work on the kernel and adding SPDX identifiers. So, =
yes, MIT would be the correct SPDX identifier here as of 3.6 (which will =
be posted in a few days).

For reference, the SPDX License List matching guidelines can be found =
here: https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines - see =
Guideline 2.1.3 specifically. Replaceable text is marked up in the =
master files that comprise the SPDX License List according the the XML =
schema and then displayed in color coded text on the website pages (see, =
for example, BSD-3-Clause - https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html

Of course, if anyone finds any other license text that deserves this =
kind of accommodation, you can always make a PR here: =
https://github.com/spdx/license-list-XML :)
