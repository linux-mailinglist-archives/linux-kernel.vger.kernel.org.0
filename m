You are right. But z->nr_reserved_highatomic value is total size of
highatomic migrate type per zone.

nr_reserved_highatomic = (# of allocated of highatomic) + (# of free list of highatomic).

And (# of allocated of hiagatomic) is already excluded at NR_FREE_PAGES.
So, if reducing nr_reserved_highatomic at NR_FREE_PAGES,
the (# of allocated of highatomic) is double reduced.

So I proposal that only (# of free list of highatomic) is reduced at NR_FREE_PAGE.

    if (likely(!alloc_harder)) {
-       free_pages -= z->nr_reserved_highatomic;
+       free_pages -= zone_page_state(z, NR_FREE_HIGHATOMIC_PAGES);
    } else {
