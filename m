Subject: [PATCH] lib/string_helpers: fix some kerneldoc warnings
Message-ID: <20190607110952.409011ba@lwn.net>
Organization: LWN.net
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Due to some sad limitations in how kerneldoc comments are parsed, the
documentation in lib/string_helpers.c generates these warnings:

./lib/string_helpers.c:236: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
./lib/string_helpers.c:241: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./lib/string_helpers.c:446: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.
./lib/string_helpers.c:451: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
./lib/string_helpers.c:474: WARNING: Unexpected indentation.

Rework the comments to obtain something like the desired result.
