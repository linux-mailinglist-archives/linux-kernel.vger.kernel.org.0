We have already done this.  I forget whether the traces are in the
email history available in the archives or whether they are stored 
somewhere else.

In any case, my analysis of the traces is in the archives.  It seemed 
very clear that the only difference which mattered was the ordering of 
the write commands (sequential vs. non-sequential).  This was obviously 
something which the commit in question would affect, and it also seemed 
likely to cause the device to slow down considerably.
