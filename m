IIUC, something like "hA is the interested access, happening within
cD (should have been cC?), which in turn happens within jA".  But I
should defer to John (FWIW, I found that notation quite helpful).

I agree with you that reviewing these comments might be "scary" and
not suitable for a bed-reading  ;-) (I didn't have time to complete
such review yet).  OTOH, from my POV, removing such comments/labels
could only make such (and future) reviews scarier, because then the
(memory-ordering) "intention" would then be _hidden in the code.

From what I've read so far, it _should be relatively straighforward
to write down a litmus test from any such comment (and give this to
the LKMM simulator).

Agreed.  Well, litmus tests (or the comments here in question, that
are intended to convey the same information) have been successfully
adopted by memory model and concurrency people for as long as I can
remember, current architecture reference manuals use these tools to
describe the semantics of fence or atomic instructions, discussions
about memory barriers on LKML, gcc MLs often reduce to a discussion
around one or more litmus tests...

Unfortunately, I don't know of more concise ways to convey the same
information that these comments are intended to provide.  Thoughts?

Please don't get me wrong: I'm all for overall design, external API,
etc., if some improvements can be achieved here.
