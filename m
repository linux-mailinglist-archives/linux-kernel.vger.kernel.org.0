I had a patches, which is why I raised the problem with the core:

6961edfee26d bridge hacks using device links

but it never went further than an experiment at the time because of the
problems in the core.  As it was a hack, it never got posted.  Seems
that kernel tree (for the cubox) is still 5.2 based, so has a lot of
patches and might need updating to a more recent base before anything
can be tested.
