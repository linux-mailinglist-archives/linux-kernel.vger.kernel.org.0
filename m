To put the final driving force behind this project, I   have also 
realized a zén (chan philosophy) name   of the divine, in the project 
"I/T Eon  Enligthenment".

As all information is factorized right in I/T Sys,   with compatibility 
back to Adams tablet, suiting   chan philosophy ("zén"), Islam and 
scientific  monotheism, many will  ofcourse want the  standard paradigm, 
and this is  what this project  is about.

No unnatural restrictions of three-letter  paradigms, but natural 
resources in the right  place, such as monotheism is. And ultimately 
scientific monotheism, and observation of all  things, is realizing one 
creator, and  enligthenment.

So my research on history and philosophy is   concluded in four projects 
now:

I/T Sys - a fair pay interface system for the whole   of internet, 
compatible with all information back   to Adams tablet, the original 
source of what   became fair pay principles, and definer of Shaytan  (or 
psychopath, the enemy of your wording of   choice). Reading also society 
for technocracy,  which means groupings, which take information  further 
to leader, as a filter of relevance, and  product quality.

I/T Eon Enligthenment - Here I realize a chan  philosophy ("zén") - name 
of the divine, answering  the current cultural  dynamic, fusing chan 
philosophy, Varanger faith, Islam and scientific  monotheism as one 
stronger monotheism,  respecting all developed schools.

I/T Partiet - Norwegian for The I/T Party, a  suggestion for a political 
party, where the   democracy is perfected in I/T.

I/T Trance Star - about the original rave culture, an  example of a 
culture that really was a push for the  same. Suggesting fair pay 
integration of tracker  files, which I always found to be a superior 
format.   Still today, the earliest files, can be played back in  24bit 
96khz uncompressed, with modern  (4- band) mastering, level tweakable if 
wanted. With   Polyphase Resampling, without interpolation  errors.
