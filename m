Huh, hibernate... Yeah, this is not expected to work, I'm afraid.

HCC is the least of the problems, and there are plenty more issues:

- I'm not sure what guarantees that the tables are at the same
   address in the booting kernel and the the resumed kernel.
   That covers all the ITS tables and as well as the RDs'.

- It could well be that restoring the ITS base addresses is enough
   for everything to resume correctly, but this needs some serious
   investigation. Worse case, we will need to replay the whole of
   the ITS programming.

- This is going to interact more or less badly with the normal suspend
   to RAM code...

- The ITS is only the tip of the iceberg. The whole of the SMMU setup
   needs to be replayed, or devices won't resume correctly (I just tried
   on a D05).

Anyway, with the hack below, I've been able to get D05 to resume
up to the point where devices try to do DMA, and then it was dead.
There is definitely some work to be done there...
