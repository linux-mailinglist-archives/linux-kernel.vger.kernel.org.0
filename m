In fact, as long as it's not used for test, hotplug will be helpful, e.g
the 2nd use case. We use 'mem=' to skip these bad part of boot memory DIMMs,
while hotplug can help us to extend RAM with good DIMMs. No need to
discard the partly broken memmory board.

Yes, I should hold it a while. Worry it's not clear enough. But in
kernel-parameters.txt, I can't write too many details about use case.

Sure, will hold.  Thanks.
