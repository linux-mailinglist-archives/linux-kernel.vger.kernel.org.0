Ok.

Generally speaking, a 64-bit kernel should work better on 64-bit hardware
even when you are running mostly 32-bit applications. However, you may
have device drivers that do not correctly set compat_ioctl handlers.

As I said, it's no problem to allow both, just explain this in the
changelog text for the driver, along with the need for the textofs
setting.

Ok, perfect!

I'm still unsure about this one. My feeling is that it should not be
in the platform
code, but I don't quite understand which hardware needs it. I see that
Lorenzo Pieralisi added the same code to arm64 in commit 9358d755bd5c
("arm64: kernel: initialize broadcast hrtimer based clock event device"),
but nothing ever calls it on 32-bit arch/arm even though the code does
get built in to the kernel.

My feeling is that either you don't really need it, or this is something
that other platforms should really do as well, and it should be called from
the generic time_init() function in arch/arm/kernel/time.c instead.

Can you try to find out more of the background here, and then
move the call to time_init() assuming it is indeed useful?
