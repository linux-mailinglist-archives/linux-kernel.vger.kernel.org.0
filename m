Right point taken, I was looking at bar()'s stack frame instead of foo()'s.
foo() did not have to save any frame record, so probably my example was
confusing. My bad.

So indeed, it seems an odd ball case.

Yeah, I am in line with that thought as well. I am reviewing the latest patch
from Steve now to understand it better.
