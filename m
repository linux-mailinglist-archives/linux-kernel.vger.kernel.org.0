Yes, I know.

robot showed these two metrics. See below.

  50190319 ± 31%     -35.7%   32291856 ± 14%  proc-vmstat.pswpin
  56429784 ± 21%     -42.6%   32386842 ± 14%  proc-vmstat.pswpout

pswpin/out are improved.

Point is that larger inactive LRU helps to find hot pages and these
hot pages leads to more cache hits.

When a cache hit happens, no swap outs happens. But, if a cache miss
happens, a new page is added to the LRU and then it causes the reclaim
and swap out.

I appreciate your attention. Feel free to ask. :)

Thanks.
