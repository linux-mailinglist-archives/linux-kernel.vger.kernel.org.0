True, but without a bias towards a user at the users request, it's just normal scheduler policy. :-)

One of the experiments I'm planning is basically that; how badly can this be abused by root. Like pretty much everything 
else, if root wants to destroy the system, not much you can do, but I find it useful to look at the pathological cases 
as well.

Agreed.

No problem.
