Yes.

The why is 'mem=3D' is used to restrict the amount of system ram during
boot. We have two ways to add system memory, one is installing DIMMs
before boot, the other is hot adding memory after boot. Without David's=20
use case, we may need redefine 'mem=3D' and change its documentation in
kernel-parameters.txt, if we don't want to fix it like this. Otherwise,
'mem=3D' will limit the system's upper system ram always, that is not
expected.

Yes, agree. As I replied in the v2 thread, I will add that into log, and
also will change text of 'mem=3D' in kernel-parameters.txt.
