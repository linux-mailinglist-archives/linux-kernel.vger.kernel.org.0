As reported by Will Deacon the following compilation warning appears
during the compilation of the vdso32:

                 from ./include/linux/thread_info.h:38,

               ^

This happens because few 64 bit compilation headers are included during
the generation of vdso32.

Fix the issue redefining the __tag_set function.

Note: This fix is meant to be temporary, a more comprehensive solution
based on the refactoring of the generic headers will be provided with a
future patch set. At that point it will be possible to revert this patch.
