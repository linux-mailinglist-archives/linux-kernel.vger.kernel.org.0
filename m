I think these issues somehow are related to the strange way we used to
jump to the out-of-line fallbacks. Since around addfc38672c7 ("arm64:
atomics: avoid out-of-line ll/sc atomics") this approach was removed.

I reproduced your patch on 5.4-rc2 and no longer get the clang build
errors. Therefore this approach is viable option.

This makes me nervous, as we're telling the compiler that the machine
we're building for has LSE - obviously it would be perfectly acceptable
for the compiler to then throw in some LSE instructions at some point.
Thus something may break further down the line.

Keen to hear Will's thoughts - but I'd suggest this is probably the
safest way forward.

Thanks,
