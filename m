I kind of had a feeling this would be the case, thanks for checking.

First I thought so. Alas it does not hold for DP MST, where you can have
connectors added and removed dynamically. I think we could ensure they
stay the same for all other connectors though. I'm pretty sure this is
already the case; they get added/removed after all others.

Another thought, from the ACPI perspective, I'm not sure the dynamically
added/removed DP MST connectors should even have acpi handles. But
again, tying all this together with ACPI stuff is not something I am an
expert on.

If a DP MST connector gets removed, should the other ACPI display
indexes after that shift, or remain the same? I really don't know.
