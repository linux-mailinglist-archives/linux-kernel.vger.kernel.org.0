Sorry, I referring to the set of properties above. In particular,
xylon,display-interface and xylon,display-colorspace, though I don't
know if the latter is talking in memory format or on the wire format.

Actually for xylon,layers-count, You should just count the child nodes
of 'layers'.

Not sure what to tell you then. You'll see it becomes a bit messy to
describe in schema. Ideally we define the exact number, order, and
values possible (or sets of those).

Certainly atomic can fail on anything not supported. My question is
more whether userspace has some minimum requirements. A cursor
couldn't deal with can_position=false for example.

Document what the h/w supports to the extent you can. Then we can make
better decisions.

Fair enough. I'd feel differently if I thought this would be common,
but this seems to be a pretty specific usecase. I guess there could be
other fixed at synthesis h/w.
