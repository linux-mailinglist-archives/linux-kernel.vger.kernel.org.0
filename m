I think they may have submitted the "fixed rate from PHY parameter"
support. I merged it because I suspected it would help in those rare
cases where an MMIO register is used to express information about the
configuration and the bootloader does nothing to help create a fixed
rate clk in DT.

Ok. Will you resend or should I look at the latest binding patch and
remove always-on? I don't see it there so maybe everything is fine.

Ok. Good to know it's not as high a priority as these other things.
