Right.  And that works for architectures without weird DMA offsets and
devices that exactly have a 32-bit DMA limit.  It falls flat for all
the more complex ones unfortunately.

At the very lowest level all goes down to the same three primitives we
talked about anyway, but there are different ways how they are combined.
For the streaming mappins looks at the table in arch/arc/mm/dma.c I
mentioned earlier.  For memory that is prepared for just mmaping to
userspace without a kernel user we'll always do a wb+inv.  But as the
other subthread shows we'll need to eventually look into unmapping
(or remapping with the same attributes) of that memory in kernel space
to avoid speculation bugs (or just invalid combination on x86 where
we check for that), so the API will be a little more complex.

Btw, are all DRM drivers using vmf_insert_* to pre-populate the mapping
like the MSM case, or are some doing dynamic faulting from
vm_ops->fault?
