I think that a lot of this might also be an argument for slowing down just
a little bit.  I really don't think that blasting through and reformatting
all of our text documents is the most urgent problem right now and, in
cases like this, it might create others.

Organization of the documentation tree is important; it has never really
gotten any attention so far, and we're trying to make it better.  But
moving documents will, by its nature, annoy people.  We can generally get
past that, but I'd really like to avoid moving things twice.  In general,
I would rather see a single document converted, read critically and
updated, and carefully integrated with the rest than a hundred of them
swept into different piles...

See what I'm getting at?

Thanks,

jon
