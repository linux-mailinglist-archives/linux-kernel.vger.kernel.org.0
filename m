Oops! wrong stack trace, this is the one where it shows that the timer handler
is running from softirq, not hardirq. Both the rcu_torture_timer() and
rcu_torture_timer_cb() run from softirq context. ftrace confirms:

[   27.949671] rcu_tort-182     8..s1 7268705us : <stack trace>
[   27.949671]  => __ftrace_trace_stack
[   27.949671]  => rcu_torture_timer
[   27.949671]  => call_timer_fn
[   27.949671]  => run_timer_softirq
[   27.949671]  => __do_softirq
[   27.949671]  => irq_exit
[   27.949671]  => smp_apic_timer_interrupt
[   27.949671]  => apic_timer_interrupt
[   27.949671]  => rcutorture_one_extend
[   27.949671]  => rcu_torture_one_read
[   27.949671]  => rcu_torture_reader
[   27.949671]  => kthread
[   27.949671]  => ret_from_fork

So looks like torture testing modifications are called for, to run them in
hard interrupt context as well to provide this additional coverage.. Or am I
way off in the woods?

thanks,
