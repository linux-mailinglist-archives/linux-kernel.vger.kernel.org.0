As stated in my v2 patch, the soft lockup problem is caused by a clock
slowdown in during the init_smp() call. This is likely to be hardware
specific and I don't have enough information about the hardware to do an
in-depth investigation of this slow down. So I opt to do just a delay of
the init call as a workaround.

This change is not actually necessary. So it is taken out from the v2 patch.
