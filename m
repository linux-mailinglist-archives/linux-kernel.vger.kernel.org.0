Yeah, I think we are all in agreement here.

I didn't advocate for making this possible (though I can see how this
would be a neat hacking tool).
Though this whole paragraph highlights one of my concerns with this
whole feature. As it stands it is _only_ useful to CRIU. Which as I said
before is fine but it still makes me queasy when an interface really
just is designed to serve a single use-case; this specific feature even
just a single user.
I'm hopeful that we can find other use-cases for testing. It's probably
already a fun feature for making pid-reuse based kernel exploits way
easier.
