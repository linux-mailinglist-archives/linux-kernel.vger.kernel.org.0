The original question was whether the kexec command line should ONLY
be measured.  That decision impacts whether a new function
(process_buffer_measurement) is needed or whether you should still
call process_measurement().

Even if it was agreed that you were adding the ability to measure and
audit the kexec boot command line, the cover letter, the patch
descriptions and the patches themselves would need to reflect that.
 The call to ima_audit_measurement() would not be hidden like this,
but included as a separate patch.
