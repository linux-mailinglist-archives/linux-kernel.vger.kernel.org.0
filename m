I just read an article about WINE on Mac OS doing more or less this.
I'm wondering if we should wire up set_thread_area() on x86_64 for
uses like this.  It even has a syscall number already -- it's just not
wired up.

Anyway, this isn't particularly high priority, IMO -- I don't think
many people set IA32_EMULATION=3Dn.  What we really ought to do is to
get rid of the special ignore_sysret path and instead go through the
normal syscall path but just do:

if (!IS_ENABLED(IA32_EMULATION))
  return -ENOSYS;

or equivalent.  The last thing we need is a whole special asm path
that essentially no one uses.
