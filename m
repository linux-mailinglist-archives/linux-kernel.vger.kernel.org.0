Well, assuming always unencrypted would obviously break on a real device 
with encrypted coherent memory?

dma_mmap_coherent() would work from the encryption point of view 
(although I think it's currently buggy and will send out an RFC for what 
I believe is a fix for that).

OK, would that mean us ditching other memory modes completely? And 
on-the-fly caching transitions? or is it just for the special case of 
cached coherent memory? Do we need to cache the coherent kernel mappings 
in TTM as well, for ttm_bo_kmap()?
