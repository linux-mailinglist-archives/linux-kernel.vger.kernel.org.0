Yes a somewhat enforced default makes more sense to me. I assume you no longer
want to put the kthreads that just need to be above OTHER in FIFO-1?

While at it, since we will cram all kthreads on the same priority, isn't
a SCHED_RR a better choice now? I think the probability of a clash is pretty
low, but when it happens, shouldn't we try to guarantee some fairness?
