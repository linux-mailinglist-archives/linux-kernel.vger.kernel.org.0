OK, that's a case I can understand :)

Given that we already have DMA_ATTR_ALOC_SINGLE_PAGES for video drivers 
and suchlike that know enough to know they want "large buffer" 
allocation behaviour, would it suffice to have a similar attribute that 
says "I'm not too fussed about alignment"? That way there's no visible 
change for anyone who doesn't opt in and might be relying on the 
existing behaviour, intentionally or otherwise.

Then if necessary, the implementation can consider both flags together 
to decide whether to try to round down to the next block size or just 
shove it in anywhere.
