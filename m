Subject: [PATCH] erofs: fix compile warnings when moving out include/trace/events/erofs.h

As Stephon reported [1], many compile warnings are raised when
moving out include/trace/events/erofs.h:

In file included from include/trace/events/erofs.h:8,
                 from <command-line>:
include/trace/events/erofs.h:28:37: warning: 'struct dentry' declared inside parameter list will not be visible outside of this definition or declaration

That makes me very confused since most original EROFS tracepoint code
was taken from f2fs, and finally I found

commit 43c78d88036e ("kbuild: compile-test kernel headers to ensure they are self-contained")

It seems these warnings are generated from KERNEL_HEADER_TEST feature and
ext4/f2fs tracepoint files were in blacklist.

Anyway, let's fix these issues for KERNEL_HEADER_TEST feature instead
of adding to blacklist...

Hi Chao and Greg,
 It seems the root cause reported by Stephen is the following (sorry for
 taking some time...) could you kindly review and merge this patch?

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
