Small correction: it is EMODPR.

Anyway, it is good to mention that these would require EACCEPT from the
enclave side. In order to take advantage of this is in a malicous
enclave, one would require SELinux/IMA/whatnot policy to have permitted
it in the first place.

Thus, it cannot be said that it breaks the security policy if this would
happen because policy has allowed to use the particular enclave.

If the security policy can define who can create legit SIGSTRUCT files,
this should not be a problem. Neither should be how EEXTEND is used.

This brings me to an open question in Andy's model: lets say that we
change the source for SIGSTRUCT from memory address to fd. How can the
policy prevent the use not creating a file containing a SIGSTRUCT and
passing fd of that to the EINIT ioctl?

If we can sort this question out, then SIGSTRUCT-centered way to control
enclave would actually be robust.
