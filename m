I have no idea.

It is not a drop-in replacement for RCU Tasks Rude because
preempt_disable() acts as a reader for Rude but not for Trace, which
needs explicit rcu_read_lock_trace() and rcu_read_unlock_trace() markers.
But it might well be that all of the schedule_on_each_cpu(ftrace_sync)
users could be adapted to use RCU Tasks Trace instead.

I would have to defer to you.  ;-)

Both removed, thank you!

Indeed I did, good catch!  Huh.  I guess the easiest fix is to back out
this change, rebase, then apply it to the earlier commit in a second
rebase.  I guess git -might- figure it out in one pass.  ;-)

Good point.  If interrupts are disabled, it will need to use some
other mechanism.  One approach is irqwork.  Another is a timer.

Suggestions?
