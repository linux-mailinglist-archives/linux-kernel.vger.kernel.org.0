Sure thing.

struct devres {
	struct devres_node node;
	u8 __aligned(ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN) data[];
};

struct devres_node = 3 pointers
kmalloc dishes out memory in multiples of ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN bytes.
On arm64, ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN = 128
(Everything written below assumes ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN = 128)

In alloc_dr() we request sizeof(struct devres) + sizeof(data) from kmalloc.
sizeof(struct devres) = 128 because of the alignment directive.
I.e. the 'data' field is automatically padded to 128 by the compiler.

For most devm allocs (non-devm_kmalloc allocs), data is just 1 or 2 pointers.
So kmalloc(128 + 16) allocates 256 bytes.

(My commit message probably requires improvement & refining.)

Yes, the objective of my patch is to keep the same behavior for
devm_kmalloc() while reverting to the old behavior for all other
uses of struct devres.

With my patch, a "non-kmalloc" struct devres would take 128 bytes, instead
of 256.

I meant the wider subject of dynamic allocation granularity.

The 128-byte requirement is only for DMA. Some (most?) uses of kmalloc
are not for DMA. If the user could provide a flag ("this is to be used
for DMA") we could save lots of memory for small non-DMA allocs.

To handle the case where sizeof(struct devres) > ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN

e.g ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN = 8 and sizeof(struct devres) = 12

Yes, it's better to let the compiler handle the padding... But, we don't
want any padding in the non-devm_kmalloc use-case.

We could add a pointer to the data field, but arches with small ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN
will have to pay the size increase, which doesn't seem fair to them (x86, amd64).

Basically, every call to devres_alloc() or devm_add_action() allocates
256 bytes instead of 128. A typical arm64 system will call these
thousands of times during driver probe.
