We can avoid this entirely by going straight for an active balance when
we are balancing misfit tasks (which we really should be doing TBH).

If we *really* want to be surgical about misfit migration, we could track
the task itself via a pointer to its task_struct, but IIRC Morten
purposely avoided this due to all the fun synchronization issues that
come with it.

With that out of the way, I still believe we should maximize the migrated
load when dealing with several misfit tasks - there's not much else you can
look at anyway to make a decision.

It sort of makes sense when e.g. you have two misfit tasks stuck on LITTLE
CPUs and you finally have a big CPU being freed, it would seem fair to pick
the one that's been "throttled" the longest - at equal niceness, that would
be the one with the highest load.

Since misfit is about migrating running tasks, a `migrate_task` imbalance
with a flag that goes straight to active balancing should work, no?

What if there is spare capacity but no idle CPUs? In scenarios like this
we should balance utilization. We could wait for a newidle balance to
happen, but it'd be a shame to repeatedly do this when we could
preemptively balance utilization.
