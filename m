This warning can come for borrowed WAKE_TCS as well.

We have a patch on downstream variant to optimize this by only checking 
tcs_in_use flag (SW check) and HW check is removed.

  static bool tcs_is_free(struct rsc_drv *drv, int tcs_id)
  {
-       return !test_bit(tcs_id, drv->tcs_in_use) &&
-              read_tcs_reg(drv, RSC_DRV_STATUS, tcs_id, 0);
+       return !test_bit(tcs_id, drv->tcs_in_use);
  }

With this we are good and don't require to put above warning as well.

if you want me to upload, i can post it and then you can drop this 
change from your series.

Or if you want to modify it as above and keep in this series i am ok.

Thanks,
Maulik
