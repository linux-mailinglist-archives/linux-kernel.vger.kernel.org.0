Sure, but if you solely rely binderfs to be used to provide binder
devices having them pre-created on each mount makes quite some sense,
imho.

This is something that Hridya and Todd can speak better to given that
they suggested this change. :)
From my perspective, binderfs binder devices and the regular binder
driver are mostly used mutually exclusive in practice atm so that this
change has little chance of breaking anyone.

Now I really need to go back to vacation time - which I suck at
apparently. :)
