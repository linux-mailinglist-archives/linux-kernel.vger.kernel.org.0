I think that all the code involved when hitting a breakpoint which would
be the minimal subset required to act as if the kprobe was not there in the
first place (single-step, fixup) should be hidden from kprobes
instrumentation. I suspect this is the current intent today with noprobe
annotations, but Thomas' proposal brings this a step further.

However, any other kprobe code (and tracer callbacks) beyond that
minimalistic "effect-less" kprobe could be protected by a
per-recursion-context in_kprobe flag.

As long as we provide a minimalistic "effect-less" kprobe implementation
in a non-instrumentable section which can be used whenever we are in a
recursion scenario, I think we could achieve something recursion-free without
requiring a bust_kprobes() work-around.

Thanks,
