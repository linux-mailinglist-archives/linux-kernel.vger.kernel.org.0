Hi,

(Thanks for that good commit log)

I'm not sure the reasoning about the fact that the clock is outside of
OS control and therefore cannot change rate is correct.

Using crust as an example, if you were to all the PRCM clocks handling
code in it, you would have already a number of cases where we would
need to change the rate. I2C bus rate and IR comes to my mind. CPUFreq
is another common example of a setup where the clock itself is outside
of the OS control, but still the OS initiates the rate change.

The RPi also has a PLL to control the whole display block that needs
to be configured depending on the resolution being displayed (and
other things), and is handled by the videocore firmware.

Of course, once the OS has asked for that new rate, the firmware is
entirely free to ignore it as long as it's properly reported to the
clock framework. But completely disabling the rates changes seems a
bit overkill.

>   - CLK_GET_RATE_NOCACHE: allows the rate to change behind the OS's back
>   - CLK_GET_ACCURACY_NOCACHE: ditto for the accuracy

So I was part of the discussions of the protected-clocks stuff a few
years ago and IIRC the discussions were only about the OS not
disabling the clocks.

I guess the arguments are sound though, but at the same time it's
pretty easy (and cheap) to do it at the driver level, and that would
make sense too. So I don't really know what to think here :)

Thanks for starting that discussion!
Maxime
