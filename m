Oh come on.  0.9 is not 12-years old.  virtio 1.0 is 3.5 years old
(March 2016).  Anything older than 2017 is going to use 0.9.

Your tables give:

	Samples	  Samples%  Time%     Min Time  Max time       Avg time
HLT     101128    75.33%    99.66%    0.43us    901000.66us    310.88us
HLT     118474    19.11%    95.88%    0.33us    707693.05us    43.56us

If "avg time" means the average time to serve an HLT vmexit, I don't
understand how you can have an average time of 0.3ms (1/3000th of a
second) and 100000 samples per second.  Can you explain that to me?

Anyway, if the average time is indeed 310us and 43us, it is orders of
magnitude more than the time spent executing a retpoline.  That time
will be spent in an indirect branch miss (retpoline) instead of doing
while(!kvm_vcpu_check_block()), but it doesn't change anything.

outl is more or less the same as cpuid and vmcall.  You can measure it
with vmexit.flat.  inl is slower.

Again: what is the real workload that does thousands of CPUIDs per second?
