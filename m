Good spot!

My logic was that drm_sched_main() would call again and that would
re-arm the timeout after the job has been completed.

But looking at this more closely I see that isn't actually going to work
reliably - if the work has been cancelled the first time then
cancel_delayed_work() will return false causing an early out and the
timeout isn't re-armed.

Is it as simple as moving drm_sched_start_timeout() out of the else case
and unconditionally re-arming the timeout? I'm worried about races with
the job that is being returned, although it has already been removed
from ring_mirror_list so perhaps it's safe to do?

Alternatively the caller could manually re-arm the timeout after
handling the job free.
