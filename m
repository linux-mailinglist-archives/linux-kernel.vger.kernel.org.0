I believe this was published in the Cortex-A77 SDEN v9.0. I will chase
it internally.

Yes, but it hurts performance.

The workaround suggested is actually invalidating the branch history
but in a costly way. I am unaware of any.

IIUC, The MOP cache is flushed on I-cache invalidate, thus it is fine.

AFAICS, yes and on top of that, it should also miss "addr" in MOP-cache
and hit "bar" before the I-cache invalidate is received. This may cause
the "bar" to be fetched from mop (and is not canceled even though there
was a mop-flush triggered by the i-cache invalidate after the hit) and
"addr" should miss in I-cache, causing it to fetch the updated instruction.

Also this means that the new context must not have executed "addr"
(which would give a hit in MOP-cache) while "bar" was fetched. So,
this adds on more constraints to actually hit it.

No :-)
