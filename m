This patch does help in the 2 RT task test case. Without it I can see a big
delay for the task to migrate from a little CPU to a big one, although the big
is free.

Maybe my test is too short (1 second). The delay I've seen is 0.5-0.7s..

Maybe I missed the real root cause. Let me dig more.

In find_lowest_rq() there's a check if the task_cpu(p) is in the lowest_mask
and prefer it if it is.

But yeah I see it happening too

Tasks on CPU 0 and 3 swap. Note that my tasks are periodic but the plots don't
show that.

I shouldn't have changed something to affect this bias. Do you think it's
something I introduced?

It's something maybe worth digging into though. I'll try to have a look.

Thanks
