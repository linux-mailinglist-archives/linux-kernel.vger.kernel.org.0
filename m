yeah, it isn't pretty, but there *are* some other similar cases where
efi-stub is populating DT.. (like update_fdt_memmap() and
kaslr-seed)..

it would be kinda nice to have an early-quirks mechanism where this
could fit, but I thought that might be equally unpopular ;-)

I defn can add this under kconfig.. is it ok if that option is
select'd by ARCH_QCOM?

(Just trying to minimize the things that can go wrong and the "I get a
blank screen at boot" bug reports I get ;-))

I think this will be nice, but it also doesn't address the need for a
quirk to get this into /chosen..  I guess we *could* use a shim or
something that runs before the kernel to do this.  But that just seems
like a logistical/support nightmare.  There is one kernel, and there
are N distro's, so debugging a users "I don't get a screen at boot"
problem because their distro missed some shim patch really just
doesn't seem like a headache I want to have.
