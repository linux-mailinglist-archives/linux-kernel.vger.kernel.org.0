Subject: [PATCH 4/6] efi/arm: clean EFI stub exit code from cache instead of avoiding it

Commit c7225494b ("efi/arm: Work around missing cache maintenance in
decompressor handover") modified the handover code written in assembler
to work around the missing cache maintenance of the piece of code that
is executed after the MMU and caches are turned off. Due to the fact
that this sequence incorporates a subroutine call, cleaning that code
from the cache is not a matter of simply passing the start and end of
the currently running subroutine into cache_clean_flush(), which is why
instead, the code jumps across into the cleaned copy of the image.

However, this assumes that this copy is executable, and this means we
expect EFI_LOADER_DATA regions to be executable as well, which is not
a reasonable assumption to make, even if this is true for most UEFI
implementations today.

So change this back, and add a cache_clean_flush() call to cover the
remaining code in the subroutine, and any code it may execute in the
context of cache_off().
