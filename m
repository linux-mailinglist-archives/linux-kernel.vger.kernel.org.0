In that case, there is no deactivation or removal of events, so yes, my patch
will not help that case. I said his patch is still useful. You gave one example,
even though in this case the rotate will not yield a reschedule of that flexible
event because fixed2 is used by a pinned event. So checking for it, will not
really help.

Yes, it will unblock the case where active events are deactivated or
removed. But it will delay the unblocking until the next mux timer
expires. And I am saying this is too far away in many cases. For instance,
we do not run with the 1ms timer for uncore, this is way too much overhead.
Imagine this timer is set to 10ms or event 100ms, just with Song's patch, the
inactive events would have to wait for up to 100ms to be scheduled again.
This is not acceptable for us.

My take is that if you have free counters and "idling" events, the kernel
should take every effort to schedule them as soon as they become available.
In the situation I described in the patch, once I remove the active
events, there
is no more reasons for multiplexing, all the counters are free (ignore
watchdog).
Now you may be arguing, that it may take more time to ctx_resched() then to
wait for the timer to expire. But I am not sure I buy that. Similarly,
I am not sure
there is code to cancel an active mux hrtimer when we clear rotate_necessary.
Maybe we just let it lapse and clear itself via a ctx_sched_out() in
the rotation code.

Sure it removed the infinite blocking of schedulable events. My patch addresses
the issue of having free counters following a deactivation/removal and
not scheduling
the idling events on them, thereby creating a blind spot where no
event is monitoring.

Only on deactivation/removal AND multiplexing so it is not every time but
only where there is an opportunity to keep the counters busy.

I think the patches are not mutually exclusive. They sort of complement each
other. My problem was that if you have free counters and idling events, you may
not need to do one more rotation and wait for it to resume active
collection, especially
when the timer may be set to a value larger than default. In my case,
I debug my issue
without Song's patch. I discovered it at the time I was ready to
submit my patch to LKML.
My patch by itself solved the problem I was seeing. Song patch is
needed to solve the
problem of the first flexible event not schedulable while other could
be. My patch does
not address that. It would address the case where that ref-cycles
pinned event is removed
and the flexible ref-cycles could take the counter immediately. So, I
am okay with you saying
this is an optimization and I think it is useful.
