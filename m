It has, previous versions had that. Somehow a lot of things went missing
and we're back to a broken neutered useless mess.

The problem appears to be that due to hardware design the feature cannot
be virtualized, and instead of then disabling it when a VM runs/exists
they just threw in the towel and went back to useless mode.. :-(

This feature MUST be default enabled, otherwise everything will
be/remain broken and we'll end up in the situation where you can't use
it even if you wanted to.

Imagine the BIOS/EFI/firmware containing an #AC exception. At that point
the feature becomes useless, because you cannot enable it without your
machine dying.

Now, from long and painful experience we all know that if a BIOS can be
wrong, it will be. Therefore this feature will be/is useless as
presented.

And I can't be arsed to look it up, but we've been making this very same
argument since very early (possible the very first) version.

So this version goes straight into the bit bucket. Please try again.
