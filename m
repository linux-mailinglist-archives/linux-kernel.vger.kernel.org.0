If understand correctly what you want is on some devices (usually the ones that
use ACPI to instantiate the devices) use the notify ACPI callback, otherwise, on
devices using OF to instantiate the devices, create a notifier. The driver
should work on both cases. The problem is that CONFIG_OF and CONFIG_ACPI are not
 exclusive and select one does not imply not select the other. So yes I'm fine
on have both ifdef blocks, but in the cros_ec_dev (patch 2/2) you should
register the notifier only if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_OF)
