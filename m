Thanks for thinking about this. I still believe it is problematic. And I 
don't like releasing "pages that should not be used" to the buddy. It 
comes with some problems if offlining fails (see below).

pfn_to_online_page() does not check against PG_offline. (which is 
correct IMHO. As documented, PG_offline means "logically offline".

The memmap is valid, however the page content should not be accessed. 
(PG_logically_offline would have been ugly ;) ).

But that shouldn't be an issue right now.

> admin might want to offline/hotremove the whole memory block via sysfs.

The admin can only trigger offlining via sysfs. Hotremove is under 
control of the driver. (removing the whole memory block)

And with the current virtio-mem prototype, this works like a charm.

And here is the thing: The owner of the page does not have to do 
anything to untrack the page. I mean that's what a reference count of 
zero actually means - no direct reference.

I could emphasize how this is to be used in the documentation:

PageOffline() pages that have a reference count of 0 will be treated
like free pages when offlining pages, allowing the containing memory
block to get offlined. In case a driver wants to revive such a page, it 
has to synchronize against memory onlining/offlining (e.g., using memory 
notifiers) while incrementing the reference count. Also, a driver that 
relies in this feature is aware that re-onlining the memory will require 
to re-set the pages PageOffline() - e.g., via the online_page_callback_t.

As I explained, this is too late and fragile. I post again what I posted 
before with some further explanations

__offline_pages() works like this:

1) start_isolate_page_range()
-> offline pages with a reference count of one will be detected as
unmovable -> offlining aborted. (see below on the memory isolation notifier)

2) memory_notify(MEM_GOING_OFFLINE, &arg);
-> Here, we could release all pages to the buddy, clearing PG_offline
-> PF_offline must not be cleared so dumping tools will not touch
    these pages. There is a time where pages are !PageBuddy() and
    !PageOffline().

3) scan_movable_pages() ...

4a) Memory offlining succeeded: memory_notify(MEM_OFFLINE, &arg);

Perfect, it worked. Sections are offline.

4b) Memory offlining failed

     undo_isolate_page_range(start_pfn, end_pfn, MIGRATE_MOVABLE);
     memory_notify(MEM_CANCEL_OFFLINE, &arg);

-> Offlining failed for whatever reason. Once we reach the notifier, the
    pages are already back in use by the buddy.
-> Pages are in the buddy, they are no longer under control of the
    driver.


To summarize the important parts

1. PG_offline has to remain set until the section is offline.

2. When we reach MEM_GOING_OFFLINE, it is too late. The pages were 
already detected as unmovable.

3. When we release pages that are supposed to be PG_offline to the buddy 
and offlining fails, we are in big trouble.

We do have one hack in current MM code, which is the memory isolation 
notifier only used by CMM on PPC. It allows to "cheat" 
has_unmovable_pages() to skip over unmovable pages. But quite frankly, I 
rather want to get rid of that crap (something I am working on right 
now) than introduce new users. This stuff is racy as hell and for CMM, 
if memory offlining fails, the ballooned pages are suddenly part of the 
buddy. Fragile.

The driver still has to synchronize against onlining/offlining requests 
and track the state of the memory blocks.

Simple example: virtio-mem wants to try yo unplug a 4MB chunk. If the 
memory block is online, it has to use alloc contig_range(). If the 
memory block is offline (e.g., user space has not onlined it yet), it is 
sufficient to update metadata. It has to be aware of the state of the 
memory blocks and synchronize against onlining/offlining.

Yes :) I could hack something via the memory isolation notifier (which 
is ugly) and MEM_GOING_OFFLINE. But if offlining fails, the pages are in 
the buddy and the driver lost control (which is one issue with PPC CMA 
implementation right now).

Again, I think routing pages via the buddy is the problematic part. (if 
offlining fails, but also the period where the pages are neither 
PageBuddy() nor PageOffline()))
