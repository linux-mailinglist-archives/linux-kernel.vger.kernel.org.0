Sure, but I'd say that it would be a more common scenario to have a 
mixture of both.

On my D06CS board (128 core), there seems to be something wrong, as the 
q0 affinity mask looks incorrect:

PCI name is 81:00.0: nvme0n1 
 

         irq 322, cpu list 69, effective list 69 
 

         irq 325, cpu list 32-38, effective list 32 
 

         irq 326, cpu list 39-45, effective list 40 
 

         irq 327, cpu list 46-51, effective list 47 
 

         irq 328, cpu list 52-57, effective list 53 
 

         irq 329, cpu list 58-63, effective list 59


And something stranger for my colleague Luo Jiaxing, specifically the 
effective affinity:

PCI name is 85:00.0: nvme2n1
irq 196, cpu list 0-31, effective list 82
irq 377, cpu list 32-38, effective list 32
irq 378, cpu list 39-45, effective list 39
irq 379, cpu list 46-51, effective list 46

But then v5.6-rc5 vanilla also looks to have this issue when I tested on 
my board:

john@ubuntu:~$ more /proc/irq/322/smp_affinity_list 
 

69

My D06ES (96 core) board looks sensible for the affinity in this regard 
(I did not try vanilla v5.6-rc5, but only with your patches on top). 
I'll need to debug this.

Cheers,
John
