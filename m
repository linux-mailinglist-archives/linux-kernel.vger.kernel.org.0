    reaper is now blocked on completion of that memory allocation
    and cannot provide the guarantee of the OOM forward progress.

OK.

Well, I do not have a strong opinion here. A simple check for the value
seems to be trivial. There are quite some holes in task_struct to hide
this counter without increasing the size.
