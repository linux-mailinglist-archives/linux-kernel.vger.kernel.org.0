I didn't mean for codegen to say "this is not important", but rather "this IS
important". And for the other ones, "this may not be important, or it may
be very important, I don't know".

Why do you say a missed atomic anotation is lower priority? A bug is a bug,
and ought to be fixed IMHO. Arguably missing lock acquisition can be detected
more easily due to lockdep assertions and using lockdep, than missing _ONCE
annotations. The latter has no way of being detected at runtime easily and
can be causing failures in mysterious ways.

I think you can divide the problem up.. One set of bugs that are because of
codegen changes and data races and are "important" for that reason. Another
one that is less clear whether they are important or not -- until you have a
better way of providing a signal for categorizing those.

Did I miss something?
