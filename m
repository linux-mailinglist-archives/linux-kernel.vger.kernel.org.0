My lack of PCI knowledge might be showing, but without the pcieport
device itself being functional (I'm assuming this is the PCIe
controller) how does a PCI scan work? In anyway, I understand that all
devices are added at the same time as of today.

Thanks. Got it.

I guess one nice thing that came out of devicetree world is that the
child devices are never probed without the parent probing first (I'm
ignoring the simple-bus devices). It also kinda makes sense to me --
without a USB port device being added and probed, it doesn't make
sense to add the (keyboard, mouse, USB-HDD, etc) devices connected to
the USB port. But this is an orthogonal debate.
