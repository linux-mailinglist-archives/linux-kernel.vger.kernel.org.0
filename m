A mini analysis of memory leaks bisection:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WdBAN54-csaZpD3LgmTcIMR7NDFuQoOZZqPZ-CUqQgA/edit#gid=1421280815

Out of 12 leak bisections that happened so far only 2 are semi-correct:
1. The bug is too old, so syzbot just proved that it happens back to
the horizon (v4.1):
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=ecc7f04cd94b5c062c000865d43bfb682d718b8e
2. The bug requires both leak detection and fault injection, was
bisected to the commit that allows them to work together:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=58c436c13ed984480edba66a224daff9c184de12
Both results are not too useful.

The remaining 10 were all diverged due to other unrelated memory leaks
and other non-leak bugs. It seems the main 2 reasons for this:
1. Lots of leaks are old (kernel is under-tested with KMEMLEAK).
2. Lots of unrelated bugs.
It's unclear how much KMEMLEAK potential for false positives is in
play. For example, lots of bisections are diverged by "memory leak in
batadv_tvlv_handler_register", but this is a true bug reported at:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=0654529ad3cc1d67a6d9812d8b75489c03dfb983
However, some are diverged by e.g. "memory leak in __neigh_create" and
"memory leak in copy_process" and these were not reported as separate
leaks, so either false positives or true leaks fixed in previous
releases.

I am going to turn off leak bisection for now (easiest way to raise
average bisection precision).
Maybe when we get overall bug levels down, and in particular number of
memory leaks, then newly-introduced leaks will be at least as
bisectable as other bug types. But this will probably require at least
several years of active work.
