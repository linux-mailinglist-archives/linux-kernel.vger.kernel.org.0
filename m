Yes, we need to wait for a setup callback to finish.  But dummy_timer 
should not be stopped; otherwise URBs that have already been submitted 
would never be given back.

The big problem is that usb_gadget_disconnect() can be called in
interrupt context.  In general, a UDC driver will need to call
synchronize_irq() to make sure there aren't any callbacks still
running, and that can be done only in process context.  dummy-hcd is
slightly different since it doesn't manage actual hardware; it calls
usleep_range() instead of synchronize_irq() -- but that also requires
process context.

We could change the gadget API to require that usb_gadget_disconnect()  
and related routines always be called in process context.  I don't know
if that's such a good idea though.  A gadget driver might want to
disconnect from within its setup handler or a completion routine, for
example.

A better approach would be to add a new synchronize_callbacks()  
pointer in the usb_gadget_ops structure.  But to work properly it 
would have to be mandatory for every UDC driver, and that's not so easy 
to accomplish.

Suggestions?
