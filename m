Great, then use that instead :)

They live on a bus, and do so in bus-specific ways, right?

Then put it on the bus it lives on, and the bus that the drivers for
that device are being controlled with.  That sounds like the sane place
to do so, right?

Almost 2 years ago?  I can't remember something written 1 week ago...

Yes, don't abuse the notifier chain.  I hate that thing as it is.

The bus controller should do this, right?  Why not just do it there?
