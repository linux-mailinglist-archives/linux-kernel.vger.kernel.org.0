I think this is the only sane way of doing things: the DT loader,
which is tied much more closely to the platform, does whatever it
needs to do to infer from UEFI variables and/or ACPI or SMBIOS tables
which bundled DT it installs, and whether/how it needs to fix things
up. This indeed constitutes a moving part separate from the OS, but
this is the only way that scales. Getting DTs for these devices into
distros is *not* what we should be doing.

The whole point of the discussion we have been having for years is
that for production use cases, we should not be dealing with evolving
in-flight DT binding in the first place. If we ship a DT loader with a
certain version of the binding and there is a need to change it, we
can only do so if we retain support for the old binding as well.

I'd prefer it if the DT loader were in charge of creating the
UEFIDisplayInfo config tables, but given that we'll need to deal with
platforms that don't implement runtime variable services, it is
something I would be able to live with in the stub.

In summary, working around platform limitations that prevent us from
delivering an accurate DT to the OS should preferably be addressed in
a platform specific pre-OS component. I haven't had the chance to look
at leif's code yet, but from what I understand, we have pretty much
what we need with the exception of the panel/gop variable handling,
no?
