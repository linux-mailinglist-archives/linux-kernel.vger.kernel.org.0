I'm torn here ... on one side, doing missing sorting might be nice
on the other hand, there is the moving without functional changes
paradigm, which is generally nice to adhere to.

But I guess sorting would generally be ok.

In general I don't "enforce" the sorting, so don't reject patches but instead
just do sorting myself if necessary ;-).

The general rule-of-thumb for nodes we came up with during the rk3288-veyron
era is something like:

compatible
reg
interrupts
[alphabetical properties]
status

as this makes it somewhat easier to parse the core properties (compatible,
reg, ints, status] when scrolling through a devicetree :-) .

Pinctrl position is at the discretion of the dt author :-D .
Position at the end has just the advantage that a long pin-group list does
not get in the way so much.

Don't change too much when moving stuff around :-)
