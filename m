The prior vDSO behavior was identical except that it was
clock_gettime, not clock_gettime64.  It's a little bit more subtle:
the syscall only happens sometimes, mostly depending on hypervisor
details, hardware, and hardware configuration.  In the preferred TSC
clock mode, we will not do the syscall for most clock ids.

The emulated vsyscall behavior is that, if the gettimeofday() vsyscall
is issued, we fake a seccomp event and we make a somewhat credible
effort to honor the result.  See arch/x86/entry/vsyscall_64.c.  In
general, I consider the combination of PR_SET_TSC to PR_TSC_DISABLE +
seccomp blocking timing syscalls to mean that fine-grained timing is
genuinely disabled.  So I don't love bypassing seccomp in this type of
context.  Also, there are a few ways that programs could fake the
return address as coming from the vDSO, the simplest of which is to
simply jump to that syscall instruction.

This is horrible but: what if we added a new parameter passed when a
seccomp filter is registered that indicates that the kernel should
remap syscalls with numbers above the given parameter.  The default
value for legacy users would be clock_gettime64 - 1 :)  The idea being
that an old trace-everything filter will sometimes get clock_gettime64
wrong, but a new one can opt in to more accurate behavior.  Ditto for
a hypothetical restart_syscall_renumbered().  I admit I still don't
love this either.
