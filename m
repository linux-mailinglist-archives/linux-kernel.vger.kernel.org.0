But that is also what /proc/slabinfo does by doing mutex_lock() at
slab_start() and mutex_unlock() at slab_stop(). So the same problem will
happen when /proc/slabinfo is being read.

When you are in a situation that reading /proc/slabinfo take a long time
because of the large number of memcg's, the system is in some kind of
trouble anyway. I am saying that we should not improve the scalability
of this patch. It is just that some nasty race conditions may pop up if
we release the lock and re-acquire it latter. That will greatly
complicate the code to handle all those edge cases.

For cgroup v1, the setting of the CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG option will allow
you to iterate and display slabinfo just for that particular memcg. I am
thinking of extending the debug controller to do similar thing for
cgroup v2.

I need to play with Roman's kmem cache reparenting patch a bit more to
see how to properly recognize a reparent'ed kmem cache. What I have
noticed is that the dead kmem caches that I saw at boot up were gone
after applying his patch. So that is a good thing.

For now, I think the current patch is good enough for its purpose. I may
send follow-up if I see something that can be improved.

Cheers,
Longman
