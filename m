I feel like I repeated myself too many times. A call trace for one lock =
dependency
is sometimes from early boot process because lockdep will save the first =
one it
encountered, but it does not mean the lock dependency will only not =
happen in
early boot. I spent some time to study those early boot call traces in =
the given
lockdep splats, and it looks to me the lock dependency is also possible =
after
the boot.

Looks like a better version. Maybe Andrew could squash that in?

Yes, I have never triggered the warning there before, so I don=E2=80=99t =
think that is a problem
belong to here.
