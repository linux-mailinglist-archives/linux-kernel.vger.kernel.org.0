No it's not poisoned AFAIK. It should be initialized - and I remember=20
that PG_reserved on memory holes is relevant to detect MMIO pages.=20
(e.g., looking at KVM code ...)

Alright, I'll prepare a simple patch that rejects offlining memory with=20
memory holes. We can apply that and see if anybody screams out loud. If=20
not, we can clean up that crap.
