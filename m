Well, SCHED_FIFO is a broken scheduler model; that is, it is
fundamentally incapable of resource management, which is the one thing
an OS really should be doing.

This is of course the reason it is limited to privileged users only.

Worse still; it is fundamentally impossible to compose static priority
workloads. You cannot take two correctly working static prio workloads
and smash them together and still expect them to work.

For this reason 'all' FIFO tasks the kernel creates are basically at:

  MAX_RT_PRIO / 2

The administrator _MUST_ configure the system, the kernel simply doesn't
know enough information to make a sensible choice.

Now, Geert suggested so make make a define for that, but how about we do
something like:

/*
 * ${the above explanation}
 */
int kernel_setscheduler_fifo(struct task_struct *p)
{
	struct sched_param sp = { .sched_priority = MAX_RT_PRIO / 2 };
	return sched_setscheduler_nocheck(p, SCHED_FIFO, &sp);
}

And then take away sched_setscheduler*().
