OK, zen1 is f17h, models 0 through 0x2f, inclusive.  We can assume the rest - 0x30 and higher - are zen2.

So historically, we've kept the source of the events for a specific model in its PPR.  I realize that that may not sound very efficient, and in fact would increase redundancy under pmu-events/, but looking at the data volume figures for each of their family names, that is how Intel does it, too.

Right, I'm just saying ideally we'd have to do this for each public PPR, not just zen1 vs. zen2.

Here is a list of publicly available PPRs, in chronological publication date order:

PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 01h B1
54945 Rev 1.14 - April 15, 2017
[used to be here: https://support.amd.com/TechDocs/54945_PPR_Family_17h_Models_00h-0Fh.pdf , but not found there any more]

https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/54945_3.03_ppr_ZP_B2_pub.zip

OSRR for AMD Family 17h processors, Models 00h-2Fh
56255 Rev 3.03 - July, 2018
https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/56255_OSRR.pdf

54945 Rev 3.03 - Jun 14, 2019
https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/54945_3.03_ppr_ZP_B2_pub.zip

^^^ those first three are zen1.

PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 71h B0
56176 Rev 3.06 - Jul 17, 2019
https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/56176_ppr_Family_17h_Model_71h_B0_pub_Rev_3.06.zip

PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 31h B0
55803 Rev 0.54 - Sep 12, 2019
https://developer.amd.com/wp-content/resources/55803_0.54-PUB.pdf

^^^ these two are zen2.

PPR for AMD Family 17h Model 18h B1
55570-B1 Rev 3.14 - Sep 26, 2019
https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/55570-B1_PUB.zip

^^^ and that's a zen1 again.

I'm sure the different PPRs for the same zen generation change their supposedly identical event descriptions, too.

The problem with that is I don't want to have to update perf every time AMD comes out with a new model.  We have the zen1 vs zen2 model range figures now, and for now this seems a good fit, until something more automated is developed against the PPRs, which have the more restrictive model ranges.

The most restrictive pattern should be first, for zen1, and to match models 0-2f, it should be something like this:

AuthenticAMD-23-([12][0-9A-F]|[0-9A-F]),,amdzen1,core

Then zen2 can be the catch-all for the rest:

AuthenticAMD-23-[[:xdigit:]]+,,amdzen2,core

Technically that family check can also be changed to make it even more future proof, e.g., 23 or higher.

As its own new patch series, but after I reply with my review for patches 2 & 3 out of 3, please.

Thanks,
