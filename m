If you've verified in some way that this driver works on A83T, I'd appreciate
your Tested-by, so I can send a patch for the A83T device tree node.

Funny you mention that. That's what I did originally for v1, but it got NAKed by
Maxime, Andre, and Jassi:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/2/28/125
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/2/28/944

Yes, you can use the existence of the mbox-names property to determine if the
driver needs one mailbox or two, as I did in this driver:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/1/789

I'll have a patch available soon that implements this for arm_scpi.

Cheers,
Samuel
