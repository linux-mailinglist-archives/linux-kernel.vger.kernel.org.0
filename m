OK, I shall try to refactor the patch within this weekend in the latest
linux-next tree.

I should abey the GPL license, so it is my duty to send my modification
to upstream and try my best to let the patch OK. If the patch can not be
merged, I can understand (especially, the patch is too late).

Oh, sorry, I missunderstood. For me, reserving the original blank line
is OK.

OK, in the latest linux tree, if necessary, I will send 2 patches.

Yes, refactoring and cleaning up the code is the patch sender's
resposibility.

And thank you for reviewing the patch.
