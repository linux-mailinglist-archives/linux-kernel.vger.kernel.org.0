I do not have an example of a bad user experience.  This observation came
about when I was modifying min_free_kbytes while working on some other
issue.  To me, it seems like the current behavior is not what one would
expect.  Logging messages when we do not overwrite the user value and not
logging anything when we do seems a bit backward.

Changing this is not important to me.  It has been like this for quite some
time and I am not aware of any user complaints/issues.

I'm happy to update the documentation to match current behavior.  Changing
the documentation may prompt people to ask if we should change the code. :)
