Thanks for acknowledging that limitation. But lets also address it.

We can not change DT bindings again when we feel like updating the driver.
The bindings should precisely and completely define the h/w, not what
mode we currently implement.
It is not for pure idealism, it actually makes the code simpler and futureproof.

I don't see why the driver should worry -- the channel carries 32-bit
message or some random value just to trigger an interrupt is purely
upto the client driver.

Not sure about that, that would be implementing virtual channels. Each
window carries one signal, and that is the minimum bandwidth assigned
to a channel.
