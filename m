Since most drivers don't need the struct device, my patch sets the
flag in the timer core. And for the few exception cases where the
device is needed, we can clear the flag in the driver. That'll reduce
the number of places mucking with OF_POPULATED.

Does this seem okay to you?

Keep in mind that struct devices cost more than one struct device of
memory. They also create a bunch of sysfs nodes, uevents, etc.

I agree with this. I'm definitely not asking to create a node just
because we want another struct device.

Right, I agree it's too late to fix this DT for vexpress-sysreg now.

If we have a timer MFD, it'd technically consume a fixed-clock and not
be empty. vexpress-sysreg just assumes the clock is 24 MHz right now.

My point about the vexpress DT nodes being weird is not about Linux
devices, rather it's that:
1. It's already a MFD
2. Most of the functions are separated clearly into their functional
device nodes
3. However, the timer functionality is combined with the parent MFD
device when the parent MFD device implements a completely separate
function (gpio?). Why?

If one wants to split out the functions, do it fully. If one wants it
all under one mega driver (ugh!) then combine it all. Going halfway
causes these weird issues. That's my complaint about how the DT layout
is for this device.

Having said all that, I'd rather manipulate the OF_POPULATED flag than
break DT backward compatibility at this point.

But in general, I think we should try to reject two separate drivers
claiming to be compatible with the same device and expecting to work
at the same time. That's just weird.
