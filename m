I think I misunderstood your feedback. You did mention issues on locking
between NMI and !NMI contexts. However, that was in the context of using the
generic irq code to do things such as set the affinity of the interrupt and
requesting an irq. I understood that I should instead program things directly.
I extrapolated this to the IOMMU driver in which I also added code directly
instead of using the existing layering.

Also, at the time, the question regarding the IOMMU, as I understood, was
whether it was posible to reserve a IOMMU remapping entry upfront. I believe
my patches achieve that, even if they are hacky and ugly, and have locking
issues. I see now that the locking issues are also part of the IOMMU
discussion. Perhaps that was also implicit.

Yes, Thomas, I should have checked first with the IOMMU maintainers
first on the issues in the paragraph above. It is not my intention to
waste your time; your feedback has been valuable and has contributed to
improve the code.

Stephane has already commented the rationale.

Thanks and BR,
