Perf metrics event doesn't support sampling.
SLOTs/FIXED3 event + Perf metrics event don't support sampling either.

Only the case SLOTs/FIXED3 event without Perf metrics events support 
sampling. But the case doesn't reach this code path. It is handled by 
the normal routing, like other sampling events.

So there is no sampling event in this code path.

Right, it looks like there is a corner case we cannot handle. The NMI 
hit can happen right after rdpmcl, but before reset.

My current thought is to disable the METRICS and SLOTs counter for first 
read. I will think about it.

Thanks,
