There is still the possibility of load fusing.  And the possibility
of defending against possible future changes as well as the current
snapshot of the code base.

The problem is that "the code is fine" is highly subjective and varies
over time.  :-/

But in this case there was a real problem, just that I got confused
when analyzing.

Before responding further, I have to ask...

Are you intending your "every KCSAN report should be analyzed" to apply
globally or just when someone creates a patch based on such a report?

In any case, you have acked this patch's successor (thank you very
much!), so on this specific patch (or more accurately, its successor)
I presume that we are all good.
