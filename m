That is exactly what I do in the following patch! Let me know if you
have further suggestions for it.

I had two minutes initially as, due to other delays I still have to
chase, booting all the way to UI on the db845c can sometimes take
almost a minute. So it was just a rough safety estimate. But in v2, I
tested with the 30 second time used by the regulator code, and that
seemed to work ok.

As long as 30 seconds is working well, I'm ok with it for now (and it
can be overrided via boot arg). Though from past experience with
enterprise distros running on servers with tons of disks (which might
take many minutes to initialize), I'd suspect its likely some
environments may need much longer.
