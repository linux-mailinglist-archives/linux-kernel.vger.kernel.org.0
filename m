I probably used wrong words. For me the most weird thing was
that the original code temporary released a lock that
was originally taken in another function.

My proposal is just a refactoring. It allows to do all
the locking/unlocking operations in a single function.
It makes is easier to track.

It was the 1st patch that changed the behavior. It moved
the pr_info() under console_lock. Therefore it never
appears on the console.

The 4th patch tries to fix this but it looks racy. I am going
to comment the race in the thread about the 4th patch.

I agree that we should make sure that the message is printed on
the console that is being disabled.

Sigh, I am afraid that a proper solution would result in a messy
code. It would be pity. The original problem is rather theoretical.
The fix is not worth making the code even more hairy.
