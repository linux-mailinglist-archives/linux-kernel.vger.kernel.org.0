I got a bit confused reading this and Doug straightened me out in a
sideband conversation.

To summarize, the drm_display_mode_from_videomode() call referenced
above is from panel-simple, and this downslotting is specific to
rockchip's clock driver. So I've asked to clarify these 2 points so
it's clear from the commit message that this patch is the best
solution. With that addressed,
