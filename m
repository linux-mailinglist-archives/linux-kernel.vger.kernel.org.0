Thanks for sending a new iteration of this. I had a look at the
licenses texts associated to the SPDX tag in the LICENSES folder, and
it turns out that the tag we should be using for that text is
MIT. While we mention X11 in the header, the text associated to the
X11 license isn't the one we have in our headers.

I guess we should make very clear in the commit log that even though
the tag now reports MIT, this maps to the same license text and is not
therefore a license change.

Thanks!
Maxime
