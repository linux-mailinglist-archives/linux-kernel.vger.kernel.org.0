I think specifically the property that the matrix allocator will try to 
find a CPU for irq affinity which "has the lowest number of managed IRQs 
allocated" - I'm quoting the comment on matrix_find_best_cpu_managed().

The ITS code will make the lowest online CPU in the affinity mask the 
target CPU for the interrupt, which may result in some CPUs handling so 
many interrupts.

Thanks,
John
