I agree with your later comment that this should NOT go to stable.

I know it's long already, but prefixing this with FTRACE_ would be good so
that other code doesn't use it for anything. It's not the end of the world
if the ftrace stack usage statistics are wonky, but if people tried to use
this for crazy things like livepatching then we'd be in trouble.

Maybe FTRACE_ARCH_FRAME_AFTER_LOCALS, which is the same length as what
you currently have?
