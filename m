Hi Laurent,

Thanks for fixing this, just a few comments.

Missing panic :)

Also can you put that detail in the 2nd commit, so that it's obvious
that it is a fix for an oops.

Can you give a section/page number for the PAPR reference.

                 "pair of" is better than "couple" I think

But the hardware that is exhibiting it, by crashing and not booting, is
mostly (all?) older hardware. So I think we probably should send it back
to stable, otherwise those machines may never get an updated kernel.

Can you add Fixes: tags to the commits, they should point at the commit
that added H_BLOCK_REMOVE support.

cheers
