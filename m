Ok, I think I have a fully and complete view of operating systems philosoph=
y.

Basically a good O.S. philosophy can be traced back to 1000 A.D. and the Sa=
xons forcing the bible, and "god" on people in Norway. Still Norway never r=
eally did not become un-varangian.
Today contemplating a background on a good O.S. based on my research, I und=
erstand that varangian culture was quite good, and building further on it, =
ridding oneself of the christian trinitarian god, we can also have a good O=
.S.

Therefore the system is now named Varanger Sys, with Cider as the original =
drink of T=C3=B3r. And the EDM culture of the 90s that Norway was largely i=
nfluental in, I have named =C3=9App Varanger EDM, that went all the way up =
to Kygo (and Maren), that represents types already established in the 90s, =
which I was part of. Very Norwegian, Scandinavian, probably European, and m=
aybe other places. And we fully support EU.

This is the final basis of my operating system philosophy, and cultural asp=
ect. Small changes may come, if it improves things.
