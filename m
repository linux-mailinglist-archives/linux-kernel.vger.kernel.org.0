Yes it won't report this with KCSAN_REPORT_VALUE_CHANGE_ONLY.  (There
was one case I missed, and just sent a patch to fix.)

It might sound like a simple rule, but implementing this is anything
but simple: This would require changing the compiler, which we said
we'd like to avoid as it introduces new problems. This particular rule
relies on semantic analysis that is beyond what the TSAN
instrumentation currently supports. Right now we support GCC and
Clang; changing the compiler probably means we'd end up with only one
(probably Clang), and many more years before the change has propagated
to the majority of used compiler versions. It'd be good if we can do
this purely as a change in the kernel's codebase.

Keeping the bigger picture in mind, how frequent is this case, and
what are we really trying to accomplish? Is it only to avoid a
READ_ONCE? Why is the READ_ONCE bad here? If there is a racing access,
why not be explicit about it?

I can see that maybe this particular file probably doesn't need more
hints that there is concurrency here (given its osq_lock), but as a
general rule for the remainder of the kernel it appears to add more
inconsistencies.

Thanks,
