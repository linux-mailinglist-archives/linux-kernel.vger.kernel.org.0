Subject: [PATCH 13/24] perf vendor events amd: Update Zen1 events to V2

From: Vijay Thakkar <vijaythakkar@me.com>

This patch updates the PMCs for AMD Zen1 core based processors (Family
17h; Models 0 through 2F) to be in accordance with PMCs as
documented in the latest versions of the AMD Processor Programming
Reference [1], [2] and [3]. Note that some events, such as FPU pipe
assignment are missing in [1], and therefore [3] is included for full
coverage of events.

PMCs added:

  fpu_pipe_assignment.dual{0|1|2|3}
  fpu_pipe_assignment.total{0|1|2|3}
  ls_mab_alloc.dc_prefetcher
  ls_mab_alloc.stores
  ls_mab_alloc.loads
  bp_dyn_ind_pred
  bp_de_redirect

PMC removed:

  ex_ret_cond_misp

Cumulative counts, fpu_pipe_assignment.total and
fpu_pipe_assignment.dual, existed in v1, but did expose port-level
counters.

ex_ret_cond_misp has been removed as it has been removed from the latest
versions of the PPR, and when tested, always seems to sample zero as
tested on a Ryzen 3400G system.

[1]: Processor Programming Reference (PPR) for AMD Family 17h Models
01h,08h, Revision B2 Processors, 54945 Rev 3.03 - Jun 14, 2019.

[2]: Processor Programming Reference (PPR) for AMD Family 17h Model 18h,
Revision B1 Processors, 55570-B1 Rev 3.14 - Sep 26, 2019.

[3]: OSRR for AMD Family 17h processors, Models 00h-2Fh, 56255 Rev 3.03 - July, 2018
