No, I meant introducing a deferred printk context that would behave
like printk_deferred().

printk safe context is more limiting. It prevents deadlock on
logbuf_lock by temporary saving the messages into per-CPU
buffers.

In scheduler, we could store the messages directly into
the main log buffer. We just need to deffer the console
handling to avoid deadlock on the scheduler locks.

printk safe context would help only when try_to_wake_up()
and all other functions using the same locks _all over
the system_ are called printk safe (or deferred) context.

By other words, printk safe context solves only printk()
recursion. It does not solve recursion of the scheduler
operations.
