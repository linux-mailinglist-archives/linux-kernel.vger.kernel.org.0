I'm still in favor for this. And Vincent seems to be OK as well:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAKfTPtBzoLnvAJ7sjPogMYS=WwBbdzWO07Kj=KDFVpO4=Su5ow@mail.gmail.com

The 'v6->v7' change note:

- Renamed arch_scale_thermal_capacity to arch_cpu_thermal_pressure
  as per review comments from Peter, Dietmar and Ionela.

is really not saying from which review comment the individual changes in
the function name are coming from. And I don't see an answer to Ionela's
email saying that her proposal will manifest in a particular part of
this change.

Cpu-invariant accounting can't be guarded with a kernel CONFIG switch.
Frequency-invariant accounting could be with CONFIG_CPU_FREQ but this is
enabled by default by Arm64 defconfig.
Thermal pressure (accounting) (CONFIG_HAVE_SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE) is
disabled by default so why should a per-cpu thermal_pressure be
maintained on such a system (CONFIG_CPU_THERMAL=y by default)?
