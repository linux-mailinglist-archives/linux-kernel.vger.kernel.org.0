Got it, All the functions are traversing through device only. I will 
change intel_cbphy_dt_parse() to intel_cbphy_fwnode_parse().
(PS: My intention is something different. As the function is fetching 
device tree node entries so kept is as *_dt_parse() )

Understand. I will follow the same and keep a note for future drivers too.

Thanks for detail explanation.
