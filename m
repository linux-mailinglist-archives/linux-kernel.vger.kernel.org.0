It's a whole new API to address processes. We already have
clone(CLONE_PIDFD) and pidfd_send_signal() as you have seen since you
exported pidfd_to_pid(). And we're going to have pidfd_open(). Your
syscall works only with pidfds so it's tied to this api as well so it
should follow the naming scheme. This also makes life easier for
userspace and is consistent.
