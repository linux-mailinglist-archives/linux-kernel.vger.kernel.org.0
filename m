Hi, Andrew!

Is this patchset good to go? Or do you have any remaining concerns?

It has been carefully reviewed by Shakeel; and also Christoph and Waiman
gave some attention to it.

Since commit 172b06c32b94 ("mm: slowly shrink slabs with a relatively")
has been reverted, the memcg "leak" problem is open again, and I've heard
from several independent people and companies that it's a real problem
for them. So it will be nice to close it asap.

I suspect that the fix is too heavy for stable, unfortunately.

Please, let me know if you have any issues that preventing you
from pulling it into the tree.

Thank you!
