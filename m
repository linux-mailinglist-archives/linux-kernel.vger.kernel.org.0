This sounds like it should be handled at the machine driver level, it's
possible some system integrator will wire things up differently.

OK, this should explicitly say that this is for use during calibration
then.

That still doesn't mean you should have control over things like if the
microphone is single ended or differential at runtime.  This at least
needs to be a higher level control, it should be integrated with both
board data and DAPM.  You can at least select idle mode with DAPM, and
you may be able to select voice wakeup that way too (by looking at where
things are routed).

You can set the gains of stereo pairs independently, that's not a
problem.

Why bother with the value mapping at all?

But how does the designer know when the sequence starts?  Don't they
mean to have a delay *after* power down?

Yes, you're unconditionally registering these so there's no sense in
splitting them.
