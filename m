Sure.

Agreed, but I was paranoid. The BUILD_BUG_ON() would also work.

Well, this is a sticky point. I allow up to 16 users at a time
(although I can't imagine more than 5, but you never know), and each
user adds a long and up to 4 more words (which is probably unlikely
anyway). And then we can have deep call stacks (we are getting deeper
each release it seems).

I figured, I start with a page size, and then in the future we can make
it dynamic, or shrink it if it proves to be too much.

Due to races with interrupts, and this not being an atomic operation, I
had to play tricks with moving the stack pointer and adding data to it.
So I wanted to keep the changing of the stack pointer and adding and
retrieving of the stack data separate.

Later patches remove the RET_STACK_INC/DEC() anyway.

Thanks for taking the time to look at these patches!
