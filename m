Totally agreed, which is why I changed the reporting to call out a
"TIMEOUT" instead of just having it enter the general failure noise.

Even something that looks like it's making progress may still be hung or
won't finish in a reasonable amount of time.

I don't think it's unreasonable to declare that no test should take
longer than some default amount of time that can be tweaked via a
"settings" file. It gives the framework the option of easily removing
tests that take "too long", etc. If the "timeout=..." value was made
mandatory for each test directory, then the framework could actually
filter based on expected worst-case run time.

This patch seeks to implement a "timeout for a single test from
kselftest's perspective". Some "individual" tests have many subtests
(e.g. anything built with kselftest_harness.h) giving us the whole
subtest issue. I think my solution here is a good middle ground: we
specify the max run time for each executed test binary/script.

It's not clear to me if a v2 is needed? Is this patch fine as-is?

Thanks!
