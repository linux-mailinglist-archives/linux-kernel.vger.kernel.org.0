As per your suggestion I tried making this driver a statically compiled 
one.
I tried various approaches with this -

1. Using arch_inticall(..) - When I used this call, I saw that once the
clients were removed, I don't see the IRQs requested by them (in 
/proc/interrupts).

2. Using module_init(..) (statically compiled) - When I used this call, 
I saw that
even after the clients were removed, I do see their requested IRQs in 
/proc/interrupts.
This behavior in #2 is the same as the one I saw when I compiled my 
driver as a module
and used arch_initcall(..).

Is there any reason why this is seen only with arch_initcall(..) used 
statically?
