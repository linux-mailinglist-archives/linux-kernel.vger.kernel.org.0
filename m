As I said I'm not an ACPI expert, so thanks in advance for your help.

I am trying to look if I can get from userspace the value of the HWID entry
exported from the driver.

$ cat /sys/devices/platform/chromeos_acpi/HWID
SAMUS E25-G7R-W35

Using acpiexec I get the element list of the MLST method, but I don't know how
to get the HWID value.

- evaluate crhw.mlst
Evaluating \CRHW.MLST
Evaluation of \CRHW.MLST returned object 0x55f17a7aed60, external buffer length 158
  [Package] Contains 10 Elements:
    [String] Length 04 = "CHSW"
    [String] Length 04 = "FWID"
    [String] Length 04 = "HWID"
    [String] Length 04 = "FRID"
    [String] Length 04 = "BINF"
    [String] Length 04 = "GPIO"
    [String] Length 04 = "VBNV"
    [String] Length 04 = "VDAT"
    [String] Length 04 = "FMAP"
    [String] Length 04 = "MECK"

Any clue?

Thanks in advance,
Enric
