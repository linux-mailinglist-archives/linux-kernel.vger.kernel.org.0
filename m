I'll add a new namespace called 'coreboot'.

It's difficult for userspace tools to find out how to access the flash
and then to find the FMAP, which resides somewhere in it on 4KiB boundary.
The "boot media params" usually give the offset to the FMAP from beginning
of the flash, but tell nothing about how to access it.

I don't even consider using binaries that operate on /dev/mem.
In my opinion CBMEM is something coreboot internal, the OS or userspace
shouldn't even known about.

I'll expose the coreboot tables using a sysfs driver, which then can be
used by coreboot tools instead of accessing /dev/mem. As it holds the
FMAP and "boot media params" that's all I need for now.

The downside is that the userspace tools need to be keep in sync with
the binary interface the coreboot tables are providing.
