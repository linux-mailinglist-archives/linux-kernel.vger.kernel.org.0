In this case, that's true for both of them. The workload runs at the
root cgroup level, so per definition the local and the recursive
counters at that level are identical and written to at the same
rate. Adding the new counter obviously caused the regression, but
they're contributing equally to the cost, and we could
remove/per-cpuify either of them for the fix.

So why did I unshare the old counter instead of the new one? Well, the
old counter *used* to be unshared for the longest time, and was only
made into a shared one to make recursive aggregation cheaper - before
there was a dedicated recursive counter. But now that we have that
recursive counter, there isn't much reason to keep the local counter
shared and bounce it around on updates.

Essentially, this fix-up is a revert of a983b5ebee57 ("mm: memcontrol:
fix excessive complexity in memory.stat reporting") since the problem
described in that patch is now solved from the other end.

Right, I reduce the *shared* data back to how it was before the patch,
but it still adds a second (per-cpu) counter that needs to get bumped,
and the loop adds a branch as well.

But while I would expect that to show up in a case like will-it-scale,
I'd be surprised if the remaining difference would be noticeable for
real workloads that actually work with the memory they allocate.
