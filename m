The main functionality of these registers is to switch the DW APB SSI
controller registers utilization: either make them being normally mapped
to the spi0:reg MMIO space (see spi0 node below) or set them being utilized
by the SPI ROM RTL, which is mapped to the spi_rom:reg ROM space. So in
first case the SPI-interface is handled by a generic SPI-controller,
while in the second one - it's purely subject of the SPI-flash access.

BTW Normally I add an SPI-flash subnode to the SPI-controller, which
will refer to the same SPI-flash as spi_rom:

Now both spi_rom and spi_flash devices can be used to access the same
memory device. But in first case it would be the read-only access in
4-bytes chunks, while in the second case - read-write in up to the page
chunks. But in addition to the spi_flash, I could place there any other
SPI-slave device, like SPI-UART controller or SPI-SD selected by a GPIO
chip-select line, and normally this should work.

NOTE also that by adding the SPI-flash sub-node of spi0 in addition to
the spi_rom I totally follow the device tree requirement to reflect the
real hardware devices structure. So from DT point of view such
construction is totally allowable and even required.

No. int_rom is embedded into the Boot Controller firmware. It has
nothing concerning SPI. boot_rom is just a mirror of either spi_rom or int_rom
depending on the system bootup mode (selected by external pins settings).
So if SPI BOOT mode is enabled at the system startup, then boot_rom =
spi_rom (at first 4MB range), if ROM BOOT mode is enabled, then boot_rom = int_rom.

Does this mean that accepting Qcom SPMI PMIC and Atmel flexcom drivers
to the MFD would be a mistake from current MFD point of view? What
changed since then?

If it was like this I wouldn't have had it submitted to the MFD subsystem.
Boot Controller has multiple sub-blocks embedded not only ROMs. By
saying so I refer to the DW APB SSI-based SPI-controller and it'
sub-nodes. See the next comment for details.

Here what the Boot Controller is from hardware point of view. It's an RTL,
which includes the next functionality/subblocks:
1) Basic system initialization at the chip startup stage, when it's
powered on (like resetting the subblocks, strapping the boot mode, etc).
2) Internal ROM with a default firmware, which is embedded into the chip
and is run at the system startup when the corresponding boot mode is enabled.
Firmware is mapped to the int_rom:reg registers.
3) DW APB SSI-based SPI-controller, though with very limited resources
(no IRQ, no DMA, just 8 bytes FIFO). So it's just a normal SPI-controller.
4) SPI ROM RTL, which allows to access an externally attached 16MB SPI-nor at
SPI chip-select #0 via the spi_rom:reg memory space. When the
corresponding flag in the Boot Controller register is set the DW APB SSI
registers are acquired by this RTL and unattached from the spi0:reg
space to access the external SPI flash.
5) Boot ROM memory space, which is just a mirror of either SPI ROM or
Internal ROM depending on the boot mode pins state strapped at the chip
startup stage.

NOTE SPI ROM RTL (spi_rom) allows just READ-only access to the SPI-flash
and makes it in 4-bytes data chunks at a time which isn't very efficient.
While by means of the direct DW APB SSI controller usage (via spi0) the
SPI-flash can be read in much bigger chunks and, which is crucial, can be
written. Moreover if GPIO chip-select is available the SPI-controller can be
attached to any other SPI-slave (not only SPI-flash).

So, yes, Baikal-T1 Boot Controller is less complex than Qcom SPMI or
Atmel Flexcom, but as I see it, the controller still has multi-function
nature: ROMs + a specific SPI-controller.

If you are still in doubts whether the Boot Controller should be
identified as MFD and don't agree to have the driver here, then where
do you think it is supposed to go? To an SPI subsystem? No, because
it has embedded ROMs. To MTD? No, It has the SPI-controller. I thought,
that MFD is for any device, which includes blocks of different
functionalities (I2C, GPIO, SPI, ROMs, RTC, UART, etc). Which as I see it
Baikal-T1 Boot Controller is.
