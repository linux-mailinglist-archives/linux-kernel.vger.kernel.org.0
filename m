As I understand it, this is handled by the patches: when a new device
shows up, this triggers the creation of the userspace interface and
also the event that leads to the kernel driver to get loaded. If there
is a kernel driver for the device, that should still load and bind to the
device, at which point the user space interface will go away again.

This may waste CPU cycles for first creating and then destroying
the user space interface, but I don't see how it requires extra work.
If it does require manual configuration or unbinding, that would
indeed be a bad design.
