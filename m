BTW, in 2.6.12 drivers/char/Kconfig has
config VT
	bool "Virtual terminal" if EMBEDDED

so the syntax appears to be identical all way back to 2005.  Going to the historical
tree, we have

So application of that particular syntax to VT goes back to 2003.  I've no idea
how far back the syntax itself goes.

One change that might be relevant appears to have happened circa 3.15, when
allnoconfig started playing odd games with EXPERT; bisect points to

Mind explaining what exactly are you talking about and how exactly have
I been involved in it?  My only involvement with kconfig (thorough all
its history) had been

    fix allmodconfig breakage

Neither of those has happened within the last couple of years and if either
has caused any breakage relevant to whatever you are doing, I would rather
hear details.  Certainly no syntax changes had been intended by either
commit and rereading those I see no likely candidates.
