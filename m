Actually I thought a bit more about the locking story, and it's a bit
worse than my simple plan here. I think better to just have that
floating around, and not make it look like it's an easy simple
cleanup.

The case I forgot about is that any places that has a printk can
recurse through the console_lock, which means we need a lot more
try_lock than I originally thought we'd need.
