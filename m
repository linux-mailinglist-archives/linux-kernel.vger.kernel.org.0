I see. You're defining "legacy code" in this case to mean code that uses a 
deprecated API, that needs to be modernized.

Thanks for the detailed explanation.

I had assumed that your intention was to find a consensus so that the 
whole tree could be consistently and automatically improved. My mistake.

Not based on feedback from me I hope -- I have no veto in this case, as 
you can see from MAINTAINERS.
