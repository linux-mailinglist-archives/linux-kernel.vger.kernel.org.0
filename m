I'm glad to hear that worked, I was going to be *very* confused if you
came back and said you were still seeing NTP records.

I would suggest that regardless of what happens with audit_enabled you
likely want to keep this audit rule as part of your boot
configuration, not only does it squelch the audit records, but it
should improve performance as well (at the cost of no syscall
auditing).  A number of Linux distros have this as their default at
boot.
