BTW, the current comment said (note, it is called =E2=80=9Caccess=E2=80=9D=
 which in this case it does read the whole word
rather than those 3 bits, even though it is only those bits are of =
interested for us),

/*
 * data_race(): macro to document that accesses in an expression may =
conflict with
 * other concurrent accesses resulting in data races, but the resulting
 * behaviour is deemed safe regardless.
 *
 * This macro *does not* affect normal code generation, but is a hint to =
tooling
 * that data races here should be ignored.
 */

Macro might have more to say.=
