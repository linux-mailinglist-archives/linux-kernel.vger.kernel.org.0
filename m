I totally don't understand what solver mode is for and when it's used,
but I'm willing to set that aside for now I guess.  From looking at
what you did for v12 it looks like the way you're expecting things to
function is this:

* ACTIVE: set wake state and trigger active change right away.

* SLEEP: set only sleep state

* WAKE: set only wake state, will take effect after next sleep/wake
unless changed again before that happens.


...I'll look at the code with this understanding, now.  Presumably also:

* We should document this.

* If we see clients that are explicitly setting _both_ active and wake
to the same thing then we can change the clients.  That means the only
people using "WAKE" mode would be those clients that explicitly want
the deferred action (presumably those using "solver" mode).

Do those seem correct?


If that's correct, I guess one subtle corner-case bug in
is_req_valid().  Specifically if it's ever valid to do this:

rpmh_write(RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x99);
rpmh_write(RPMH_SLEEP_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x0);
rpmh_write(RPMH_WAKE_ONLY_STATE, addr=3D0x10, data=3D0x0);

...then it won't work.  You'll transition between sleep/wake and stay
with "data=3D0x99".  Since "sleep =3D=3D wake" then is_req_valid() will
return "false" and we won't bother programming the commands for
sleep/wake.  One simple way to solve this is remove the
"req->sleep_val !=3D req->wake_val" optimization in is_req_valid().


I guess we should also document that "batch" doesn't work like this.
The "batch" API is really designed around having exactly one "batch"
caller (the interconnect code) and we assume that the batch code will
be sending us pre-optimized commands I guess?  Specifically there
doesn't seem to be anything trying to catch batch writes to "active"
and also applying them to "wake".
