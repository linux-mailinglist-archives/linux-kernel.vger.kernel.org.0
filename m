By double checking what NR_ANON_THPS really means, 
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt says "Non-file backed huge pages 
mapped into userspace page tables". Then it makes some sense to dec 
NR_ANON_THPS when removing rmap even though they are still THPs.

I don't think we would like to change the definition, if so a new 
counter may make more sense.
