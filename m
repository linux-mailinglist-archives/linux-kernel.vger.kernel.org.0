For example:

  + ip22zilog_console_setup() calls  __ip22zilog_startup() that does
    some initialization of the device

  + pl011_console_setup() does some non-trivial things as well.

Honestly, I am not familiar with these devices. I am not sure if it is
dangerous or safe to call these functions twice.

I am not sure if anybody would know this for sure. Therefore I suggest a
conservative approach and avoid calling setup() twice().

I think that it is dangerous and error-prone design. The best solution
would be to split setup() and match() functionality.

Petr
