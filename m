Maybe adding a dummy slot in cpuid_leafs in patch 0002 to avoid the
compilation errors?

Those KVM BUILD_BUG_ON() want to find out any empty leaf in
reverse_cpuid (and also cpuid_leafs).

The patch 0002 actually creates such empty leaf 12 in cpuid_leafs. So
CPUID_7_EDX=17 instead of NCAPINTS-1=18 in cpuid_leafs. It's not
desired.

After applying patch 0003, the hole is filled in and there is no
compilation error from the KVM BUILD_BUG_ON() checks. So the compilation
errors only happens in bisect.

Is it OK to add the above patch to the patch 0002 to solve the
compilation errors? If it's ok, I will explain in commit message why add
CPUID_DUMMY.

Thanks.
