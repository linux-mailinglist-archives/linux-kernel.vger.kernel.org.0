Good questions. It would be great to check the usage on some real
systems.

In each case, we should inform users when messages and/or dictionaries
were lost.

Also it would be great to have a way (function) that would show how
big parts of the two ring buffers are occupied by valid data. It might
be useful also to detect problems with the ring buffer:

   + too many space reserved but not commited

   + too many records invalidated because of different ordering
     in desc ring and data ring.

I wish the dictionaries were never added ;-) They complicate the code
and nobody knows how many people actually use the information.
