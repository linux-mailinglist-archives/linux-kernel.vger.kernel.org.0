Thanks for working to improve the documentation.  There are some problems
here, none of which are your creation, but I would sure like to resolve
them while working with this document.

The first of these is that Documentation/filesystems is really the wrong
place for this file - it's covering the internal API for subsystems that
want to create entries in sysfs.  IMO, it belongs in either the driver-API
manual or the core-API manual - probably the latter.

Nits: We can really just drop emphasis like that, it doesn't really help
anybody.  Also the period can go on section headers.

I would be absolutely amazed if either of those email addresses works at
this point.  I'd take them out.

Dates like that are a red flag.  See below.

In the spirit of minimal markup, I'd do the above as:

   it by doing::

	mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys

But then I know that others are much more fond of .. code-block and syntax
highlighting than I am.

Here is where we go pretty far off the rails.  If you go looking in
include/linux/sysfs.h, the actual definition of this structure is:

struct attribute {
	const char		*name;
	umode_t			mode;
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC
	bool			ignore_lockdep:1;
	struct lock_class_key	*key;
	struct lock_class_key	skey;
#endif
};

Most notably, the owner field went away quite some time ago.

Documentation like this is not really useful to anybody; once a reader
realizes it doesn't describe current reality, they will justifiably
disregard it.  This isn't your fault, of course, but converting something
like this to RST gives the illusion that it has been updated, when that is
very much not the case.

At a bare minimum, an effort like this needs to put a big flashing warning
at the top of the file.  But it would be soooooo much better to actually
update the content as well.

The best way to do that would be to annotate the source with proper
kerneldoc comments, then pull them into the documentation rather than
repeating the information here.  Is there any chance you might be up for
taking on a task like this?

Thanks,

jon
