No problem.

They're not setup as such, but my testing infrastructure is heavily
automated so it's easy to do and I think it's worth looking at. If you
update your patch to target just the scan period aspects, I'll queue it
up and get back to you. It usually takes a few days for the automation
to finish whatever it's doing and pick up a patch for evaluation.
