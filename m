Excellent question.  It would be really nice to have a CPU-stopper stall
warning, wouldn't it?  But who knows?  Maybe I am the only one to have
run into this.  However, the comment in multi_cpu_stop() just before
the call to touch_nmi_watchdog() leads me to believe otherwise.  ;-)

Indeed.  Your point being?

Thank you, that is what I needed to know.
