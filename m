This is not 10nm specific. It is applicable for other nms also.
Its specific to the frequency being set. If vco_recalc returns the same 
value as being set by vco_set_rate,
vco_set_rate will not be invoked second time onwards.

For example: Lets take below devices:

Cheza is based on SDM845 which is 10nm only.
Clk frequency:206016
dsi_pll_10nm_vco_set_rate - DSI PLL0 rate=1236096000
dsi_pll_10nm_vco_recalc_rate - DSI PLL0 returning vco rate = 1236095947

Trogdor is based on sc7180 which is also 10nm.
Clk frequency:69300
dsi_pll_10nm_vco_set_rate - DSI PLL0 rate=1663200000
dsi_pll_10nm_vco_recalc_rate - DSI PLL0 returning vco rate = 1663200000

In same trogdor device, we slightly changed the clock frequency and the 
values actually differ which will not cause any issue.
Clk frequency:69310
dsi_pll_10nm_vco_set_rate - DSI PLL0 rate=1663440000
dsi_pll_10nm_vco_recalc_rate - DSI PLL0 returning vco rate = 1663439941
