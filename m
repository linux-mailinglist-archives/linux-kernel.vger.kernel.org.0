There was always a problem with handoff from the bootloader. tcpm_init() calls
tcpm_reset_port() which turns vbus and vconn off, which I imagine can
trigger the situation.

Unfortunately I was never able to solve the puzzle. The Type-C protocol does
not support any kind of "hand-off" from one component in the system to another.
If the state machine doesn't start from a clean state, there is pretty
much no guarantee that it ever synchronizes.

Maybe someone can find a better solution, but when I wrote the code I just
could not get it to work reliably without resetting everything during
registration.

Note that v4.4 did not include the upstream tcpm code, suggesting the
code in the vendor kernel was possibly using a different or backported
state machine. Impossible to say what was done there without access
to the code.
