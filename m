Not frequently. Just once. I couldn't afford FS corruption during update,
so I reverted the compression support shortly after.

But I wasn't stressing the system much with FS activity after applying the
initial fix.

Yes, AFAIK. I reverted it and run a few cycles of install 500MiB worth of
packages, uninstall the packages with pacman. And it didn't re-occur. I never
saw any issues with compression support patch reverted.

Yes, but I didn't ever see it on anything else. Just on two 8 core cortexes A7.
