+Boot configuration expands the current kernel command line to support
+additional key-value data while booting the kernel in an efficient way.
+This allows administrators to pass a structured key configuration file
+as a way to supplement the kernel command line to pass system boot parameters.
 
-Config File Syntax
-==================
+Compared with the kernel command line, the boot configuration can provide
+scalability (up to 32 KiB configuration data including comments), readability
+(structured configuration with comments) and compact expression of option
+groups.
+
+When to Use the Boot Configuration?
+-----------------------------------
+
+The boot configuration supports kernel command line options and init daemon
+boot options. All sub-keys under "kernel" root key are passed as a part of
+the kernel command line [1]_, and ones under "init" root key are passed as
+a part of the init daemon's command line. For example, ::
+
+   root=UUID=8cd79b08-bda0-4b9d-954c-5d5f34b98c82 ro quiet splash console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty0
+
+This can be written as following boot configuration file.::
+
+   kernel {
+      root = "UUID=8cd79b08-bda0-4b9d-954c-5d5f34b98c82" # nvme0n1p3
+      ro       # mount rootfs as read only
+      quiet    # No console log
+      splash   # show splash image on boot screen
+      console = "ttyS0,115200n8" # 1st console to serial device
+      console += tty0            # add 2nd console
+   }
+
+If you think that kernel/init options becomes too long to write in boot-loader
+configuration file or you want to comment on each option, the boot
+configuration may be suitable. If unsure, you can still continue to use the
+legacy kernel command line.
 
-The boot config syntax is a simple structured key-value. Each key consists
-of dot-connected-words, and key and value are connected by ``=``. The value
-has to be terminated by semi-colon (``;``) or newline (``\n``).
-For array value, array entries are separated by comma (``,``). ::
+Also, some features may depend on the boot configuration, and each such
+feature has its own root key. For example, ftrace boot-time tracer uses
+"ftrace" root key to describe its options [2]_. If you want to use such
+features, you need to enable the boot configuration.

+
+
+How to Use the Boot Configuration?
+----------------------------------
+
+To enable the boot configuration support on your kernel, it must be built with
+``CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG=y`` and ``CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y``.
+
+Next, you can write a boot configuration file and attach it to initrd image.
+
+The boot configuration file is attached to the end of the initrd (initramfs)
+image file with size, checksum and 12-byte magic word as below.
+
+[initrd][bootconfig][size(u32)][checksum(u32)][#BOOTCONFIG\n]
+
+The Linux kernel decodes the last part of the initrd image in memory to
+get the boot configuration data.
+Because of this "piggyback" method, there is no need to change or
+update the boot loader or the kernel image itself.
+
+To do this operation, Linux kernel provides the "bootconfig" command under
+tools/bootconfig, which allows admin to apply or delete the configuration
+file to/from an initrd image. You can build it by the following command::
+
+ # make -C tools/bootconfig
+
+To add your boot configuration file to an initrd image, run bootconfig as
+below (Old bootconfig is removed automatically if it exists)::
+
+ # tools/bootconfig/bootconfig -a your-config /boot/initrd.img-X.Y.Z
+
+To remove the configuration from the image, you can use the ``-d`` option
+as below::
+
+ # tools/bootconfig/bootconfig -d /boot/initrd.img-X.Y.Z
+
+At last, add ``bootconfig`` on the normal kernel command line to tell the
+kernel to look for the bootconfig at the end of the initrd file. For example::
+
+  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="bootconfig"
+
+
+Boot Configuration Syntax
+=========================
+
+The boot configuration syntax is a simple structured key-value. Each key
+consists of dot-connected-words, and key and value are connected by ``=``.
+The value has to be terminated by semicolon (``;``) or newline (``\n``).
+For an array, its entries are separated by comma (``,``). ::
+
+  KEY[.WORD[...]] = VALUE[, VALUE2[...]][;]
 
 Unlike the kernel command line syntax, spaces are OK around the comma and ``=``.
 
 Each key word must contain only alphabets, numbers, dash (``-``) or underscore
 (``_``). And each value only contains printable characters or spaces except
-for delimiters such as semi-colon (``;``), new-line (``\n``), comma (``,``),
+for delimiters such as semicolon (``;``), new-line (``\n``), comma (``,``),
 hash (``#``) and closing brace (``}``).

-Key-Value Syntax
-----------------
+Tree Structured Key
+-------------------
 
-The boot config file syntax allows user to merge partially same word keys
-by brace. For example::
+The user can group identical parent keys together and use braces to list child
+keys under them. For example::
 
  foo.bar.baz = value1
  foo.bar.qux.quux = value2
+ foo.bar.qux.quuz = value3
 
 These can be written also in::
 
  foo.bar {
-    baz = value1
-    qux.quux = value2
+   baz = value1
+   qux {
+      quux = value2
+      quuz = value3
+   }
  }
 
 Or more shorter, written as following::
 
- foo.bar { baz = value1; qux.quux = value2 }
+ foo.bar { baz = value1; qux { quux = value2; quuz = value3 } }
 
 In both styles, same key words are automatically merged when parsing it
 at boot time. So you can append similar trees or key-values.

 Config File Limitation
 ======================
 
-Currently the maximum config size size is 32KB and the total key-words (not
-key-value entries) must be under 1024 nodes.
-Note: this is not the number of entries but nodes, an entry must consume
-more than 2 nodes (a key-word and a value). So theoretically, it will be
-up to 512 key-value pairs. If keys contains 3 words in average, it can
-contain 256 key-value pairs. In most cases, the number of config items
-will be under 100 entries and smaller than 8KB, so it would be enough.
-If the node number exceeds 1024, parser returns an error even if the file
-size is smaller than 32KB.
-Anyway, since bootconfig command verifies it when appending a boot config
-to initrd image, user can notice it before boot.
