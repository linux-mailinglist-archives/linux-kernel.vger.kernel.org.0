I am all for naming/framing this as a more generic option (good it at
least does not have SYZ in the name :)).

Re making it a single config vs a set of fine-grained configs. I think
making it fine-grained is a proper way to do it, but the point Tetsuo
raised is very real and painful as well -- when a kernel developer
adds another option, they will not go and update configs on all
external testing systems. This problem is also common for "enable all
boot tests that can run on this kernel", or "configure a 'standard'
debug build". Currently doing these things require all of expertise,
sacred knowledge, checking all configs one-by-one as well as checking
every new kernel patch and that needs to be done by everybody doing
any kernel testing.
I wonder if this can be solved by doing fine-grained configs, but also
adding some umbrella uber-config that will select all of the
individual options. Config system allows this, right? With "select" or
"default if" clauses. What would be better: have the umbrella option
select all individual, or all individual default to y if umbrella is
selected?

FTR, some of the things we would like to disable are collected here:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/1622

Steve, I am not sure if by lockdown you mean the existing lockdown
mechanism, or just something similar in nature. As Tetsuo pointed, the
possibility of using the existing lockdown mechanism for this was
discussed here (and rejected):
