Yes, if the provider is registered before the clock registration, it
will reparent successfully.

OK, I have exchanged the position for devm_clk_hw_register and 
devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider in meson-eeclk.c.

It reparents successfully for orphan clock.

Is is ok that put devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider ahead?

As far as I am concerned, there is no any effect.
