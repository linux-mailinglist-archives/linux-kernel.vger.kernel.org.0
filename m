okay, the remaining question is that in vgic_v3_save_pending_tables():

	stored = val & (1U << bit_nr);
	if (stored == irq->pending_latch)
		continue;

	if (irq->pending_latch)
		val |= 1 << bit_nr;
	else
		val &= ~(1 << bit_nr);

Do we really have a scenario where irq->pending_latch==false and
stored==true (corresponds to the above "else") and then we clear
pending status of this LPI in guest memory?
I can not think out one now.

Thanks for pointing it out.
