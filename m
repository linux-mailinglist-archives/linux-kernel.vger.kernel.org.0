I agree the hardware description becomes inaccurate with this change.

In the current setup complete 0x3000_0000 to 0x3005_0000 range is being mapped
as normal memory (MT_NORMAL_NC). Though only 0x3004_E000 to 0x3005_0000 are
accessible by the kernel. I am seeing an issue where a read access (which I
believe is speculative) to inaccessible range causes an SError. Another 
solution for this problem could be to add "no-memory-wc" to SysRAM node so that
it is mapped as device memory (MT_DEVICE_nGnRE). Would that be acceptable?

Secure-OS addresses are not of interest here. SysRAM is partitioned
between secure-OS and BPMP and kernel is only interested in the BPMP
part. The firmware can update these addresses in the device-tree if it
wants to. Would you prefer something similar implemented in u-boot so
that it updates SysRAM node to only expose kernel accessible part of it
to the kernel?

Can u-boot dynamically figure out the Secure-OS vs BPMP partition?
