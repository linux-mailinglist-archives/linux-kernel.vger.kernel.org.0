I like this idea. console_loglevel is temporary manipulated only
when some messages should or should never appear on the console.
Storing this information in the message flags would help
to solve all the related races.

Yes, this would be useful for the other situations when all printk's
in a particular context should be handled this way. We could build
it on top of this patch.

printk_safe buffer preserves KERN_* headers. It should be
possible to insert KERN_UNSUPPRESSED there.

The patch itself looks fine on the first sight. If we go
forward, please, split the printk and sysrq part
into two patches.
