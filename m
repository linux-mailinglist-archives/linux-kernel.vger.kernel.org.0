This is one of those places the ISA has drifted around a bit: in the user ISA 
there is a time CSR, and CSRs are all per-hart state so logically there is a 
timer per hart.  We used to actually build systems this way (with an SOC agent 
what would actively increment each CSR whenever the RTC fired), but it ended up 
being impractical for a bunch of reasons.  There was never a way to actually 
write these time CSRs from supervisor mode, but machine-mode software could 
write them so it would have been possible to build system that had different 
time values on different harts.

As a result we ended up with per-CPU timers in Linux, but they never actually 
worked correctly: there's a bunch of per-CPU state in the driver, but nothing 
to actually enforce that timer reads go to the correct hart.  For example, get 
the time on hart 0 you'd have to IPI over to that hart, do a local CSR read, 
and then IPI the time back.  As a result the per-CPU state never really made 
any sense, but it kind of just hung around because it worked fine on the 
systems we were building (which always had time synced up anyway) and was 
closer to what the spec allowed -- we didn't IPI over because time was always 
synchronized on systems that actually existed and the IPIs are super slow, but 
the scaffolding stuck around.

As part of cleaning up the privileged ISA for ratification we decided to 
mandate that the time CSRs on every hart are always within a single tick of 
each other, effectively mandating a single time across the system.  This was 
partially motivated by Linux, but mostly by a new approach we were taking to 
the hypervisor specification -- rather than a hypervisor mode, we decided to 
just extend supervisor mode to support fast nested virtualization, which means 
we now have "htimedelta" (a per-hart timer offset) rather than per-hart timers.  
This is more efficient because the per-state stays constant so we don't need to 
actively tick it, and since it makes the per-hart time state unnecessary we 
decided to drop that extra state.

The change to global time on RISC-V systems rendered the per-CPU timers 
defunct, but since they weren't really doing anything they just stuck around.  
The cleanup seems perfectly reasonable to me, modulo the issue I've pointed out 
below...

Someone's client has mangled the patches, but I think there's an issue here: 
we're still calling the init code for every "riscv" DT entry, but there's now 
only a single "struct clocksource".  This will result in a single clocksource 
being initialized multiple times, which I assume is an issue.
