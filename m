Right, I see. I misunderstood what was meant by "cc" indicating that the
assembly modified the flags.

Due to the context I interpreted it as irqflags whereas it concerns the
condition flags (hence the 'c' I presume...). It all makes more sense now.

Yes, definitely seems like it would be better! I'll take that
suggestion, thanks.
