I wouldn't be so sure about only setting the SYSCLK once - if you've got
an input clock you can configure then you might for example want to
switch between 44.1kHz and 48kHz bases, and disable it or run it at very
low frequency when idle.  In some systems it's as dynamic as a PLL is.

Things like simple-card are good for 90% of systems but I'm fairly sure
we'll never be able to handle more complex setups entirely
automatically.  What we *should* be doing over time is transitioning all
this clock stuff into the actual clock framework but that's a big, long
term thing which nobody is currently actually working on.
