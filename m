[Looks like everyone's going all-in in this thread, so be it]

I am glad RMS made past pro-paedophile statements. I support them, as a 
man, and as an enemy of women who want men to be equal or servile to 
women.

The Torah explicitly allows men to marry female children, including in 
cases of the rape (tahphas) of the girl child: Devarim chapter 22, verse 
28. Key words: Na'ar (child (hebrew masoretic text)), Padia (child: 
padia+philos = paedophillia (greek septuagint)) Puella (young girl 
(latin vulgate))

> Nachmanides points out that a child may be called na'ar from the moment

Sunni Islam also allows child brides: Bukari Hadith book 5. Ashia was a 
child when she married Muhammed:
Sahih Bukhari 5:58:236
Sahih Bukhari 7:62:64
Sahih Bukhari 8:73:151

The vedic traditions also allow, or require, child marraige: saying that 
if a man fails to marry his daughter off by 9 or 12 he goes to hell.

I am a prolific free-software hacker and have been so for 20 years. (My 
current project is: libregamewiki.org/Chaos_Esque_Anthology , where I 
brought the project from 18 weapons to over 200, added spell casting, 
city generation, built many maps(50+) and 3d models (100+), along with 
textures, music, etc)
I am also a licensed attorney.

I support RMS' past statements regarding paedophillia, and am saddened 
and hurt that he has retracted them and has stepped away on the path to 
eventually presumably endorsing the jailing, torture, and killing of 
man-on-girl (AKA: virgin marraige) paedophiles: in keeping with the 
religion of his despicable country and the rulers there-of (said 
country's women)

Why RMS? Why?
Man+girl is GOOD for men.
It's BAD for women.
Man being an economic slave to woman is GOOD for women, and BAD for men. 
There is no happy middle ground.
