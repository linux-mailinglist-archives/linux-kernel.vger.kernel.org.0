I was trying to convey that the nature of SGX itself requires that an
enclave's pages are shared between process.  E.g. {MAP,VM}_SHARED would be
required even if we modified the mmu to handle EPC memory in such a way
that it didn't have to be tagged with VM_PFNMAP.

Future is referring to the timeline of a running kernel, not the future
of the kernel code.

Rather than trying to explain all of the above with words, I'll provide
code examples to show how ->may_protect() will be used by SGX and why it
is the preferred solution.
