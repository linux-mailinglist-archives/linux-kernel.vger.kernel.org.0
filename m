So how do we move this forward?

To sum up his regulator needs to be able to bypass accesses to
SPMI_COMMON_REG_VOLTAGE_RANGE and provide the range in some other way
hence the change below

I can't find a simpler solution than this since the function does now
what is supposed to do for all the regulator types supported in the driver
