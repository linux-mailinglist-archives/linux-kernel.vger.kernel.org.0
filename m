I looked into this issue the last time I mentioned split mm
accounting. See [1]. It's my sense that the original change was
inadequately justified; Michal Hocko seems to agree. I've tried
disabling split rss accounting locally on a variety of systems ---
Android, laptop, desktop --- and failed to notice any difference. It's
possible that some difference appears at a scale beyond that to which
I have access, but if the benefit of split rss accounting is limited
to these cases, split rss accounting shouldn't be on by default, since
it comes at a cost in consistency.

This position doesn't seem to be the thread consensus yet.

There's no build-time configuration for split RSS accounting. It's not
reasonable to expect people to carry patches just to get their memory
usage numbers to add up.

If a thread incurs TASK_RSS_EVENTS_THRESH - 1 page faults and then
sleeps for a week, all memory counters observable from userspace will
be wrong for a week. Multiply this potential error by the number of
threads on a typical system and you have to conclude that split RSS
accounting produces a lot of potential uncertainty. What are we
getting in exchange for this uncertainty?

The intended use is measuring memory levels of various processes over
time, not just detecting "spikes". In order to make sense of the
resulting data series, we need to be able to place error bars on it.
The presence of split RSS accounting makes those error bars much
larger than they have to be.

I think we should just delete the split RSS accounting code unless
someone can demonstrate that it's a measurable win on a typical
system. The first priority of any system should be correctness.
Consistency is a kind of correctness. Departures from correctness
coming only from quantitatively-justifiable need.
