Well, sort of. Depends on whether this is plain %p or %p<something>.

In the former case, the pointer would have been treated as any other
"valid" kernel pointer, hence passed through the ptr_to_id() and printed
as the result of, roughly, siphash((long)ptr) - i.e. some hex number
that has nothing directly to do with the -EIO that was passed in.
Moreover, while the printed value would be the same for a given error
code during a given boot, on the next boot, the hashing would use a
different seed, so would result in another "random" hex value being
printed - which one can easily imagine makes debugging harder. With my
patch, these would always result in "EIO" (or its decimal
representation) being printed.

In the latter case, yes, all the %p extensions that would somehow
dereference ptr would then be caught in the check_pointer() and instead
of printing (efault), we'd (again) get the symbolic error code.

In both cases, I see printing the symbolic errno as a clear improvement
- completely independent of whether we somehow want to make it
"officially allowed" to deliberately pass ERR_PTRs (and I see that I
forgot to update Documentation). So while that is really the main point
of the patch, IMO the patch can already be justified by the above.

[A few of the %p extensions do not dereference ptr (e.g. the %pS aka
print the symbol name) - I think they just print ptr as a hex value if
no symbol is found (or !CONFIG_KALLSYMS). I can't imagine how an ERR_PTR
would be passed to %pS, though, and again, getting the symbolic error
(or the decimal -22) should be better than getting -22 printed as a hex
string.]

Maybe. Or one could make it default y and then only make it possible to
deselect if CONFIG_EXPERT - only really space-constrained embedded
devices would want this disabled, I think. But I prefer keeping it
simple, i.e. keeping it as-is for now.

Thanks. The buildbot apparently tried to compile the errcode.h header by
itself and complained that NULL was not defined, so I'll respin to make
it happy, and add a note to Documentation/. Can I include that ack even
if I don't change the Kconfig logic?

Thanks,
Rasmus
