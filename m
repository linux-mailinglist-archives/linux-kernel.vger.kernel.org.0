It appears that the GPU expects to use a specific region of ocmem,
specifically starting at 0. The freedreno driver allocates 1MB of
ocmem on the Nexus 5 starting at ocmem address 0. As a test, I
changed the starting address to 0.5MB and kmscube shows only half the
cube, and four wide black bars across the screen:

That's my understanding as well.

Given that the GPU is expecting a fixed address in ocmem, perhaps it
makes sense to have the child node. How about this based on the
sram/sram.txt bindings?

  ocmem: ocmem@fdd00000 {
    compatible = "qcom,msm8974-ocmem";

    reg = <0xfdd00000 0x2000>, <0xfec00000 0x180000>;
    reg-names = "ctrl", "mem";

    clocks = <&rpmcc RPM_SMD_OCMEMGX_CLK>, <&mmcc OCMEMCX_OCMEMNOC_CLK>;
    clock-names = "core", "iface";

    gmu-sram@0 {
      reg = <0x0 0x100000>;
      pool;
    };

    misc-sram@0 {
      reg = <0x100000 0x080000>;
      export;
    };
  };

I marked the misc pool as export since I've seen in the downstream ocmem
sources a reference to their closed libsensors that runs in userspace.

Looking at the sram bindings led me to the genalloc API
(Documentation/core-api/genalloc.rst). I wonder if this is the way that
this should be done?
