I would at least hope that there are some quick wins with some cases that 
are pretty obvious to be added to existing entries. A first scan suggested 
that it should not take too much detective work to figure it out for some 
of those files.

For files that have not been touched in years---which I hope are not the 
majority of the cases---it would be nice to see if I can find out that 
these files are part of a entry/subsystem that actually maintains them, 
but did not need to touch them in years, or if these files are orphaned 
(or even meaningless left-overs) but nobody noticed because it was never 
made explicit in the MAINTAINERS file.

After those quick wins, getting this done for ALL files could turn out to 
be impossible, and just checking for future changes and reacting to those 
is the better approach to ensure that new files have an entry in  
MAINTAINERS, but I guess I will find out how much is quickly and easily 
allocated to a MAINTAINERS entry and what cannot be determined as outsider 
and relying on get_maintainer.pl is more reliable than getting a 
confirmation for a dedicated entry in MAINTAINERS.

If the feedback is consistently discouraging to update existing entries 
with additions for currently non-assigned files, I will stop figuring out 
the changes and relying on get_maintainers.pl without making use of any 
data from the MAINTAINERS file for those cases remains the best option, 
just as it is today.

I am willing to investigate if this point can be improved in the 
MAINTAINERS file. If it is all good, as it is right now, or it simply 
cannot be improved without a lot of attention from many developers, 
everything can stay as-is and I will look into other topics.
