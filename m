If you just try to do 1:1 replacement with the legacy functions you stop 
being v6 compliant. You after that need to go through quite a lot of 
hoops and extra code to get that back.

You cannot use kernel functions - this is on the host userspace side of UML.

It is using shared code for (at present) tap (two forms - one optimized 
for throughput, one using a tap/socket pair optimized for packets per 
second), raw sockets, gre, l2tpv3 (both raw and over udp) and one 
flavour unix domain sockets.

Both gre and l2tpv3 support v4 and v6.

While it is possible to replace getaddrinfo with a sequence of 
gethostbyname, etc it will:

1. Grow the size of the code by at least 100 lines if not more. If I 
take care of all corner cases which getaddrinfo() does - more.

2. Defeat one of the purposes of the exercise - to make it easy to add 
new socket transports.

3. There is no guarantee that the glibc guys will not make gethostbyname 
and friends fallback to getaddrinfo internally one day (in fact I am 
surprised they have not done it yet).
