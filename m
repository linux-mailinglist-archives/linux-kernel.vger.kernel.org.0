See, I disagree. The WAIT/WAKE pair is an implementation of the MONITOR
pattern. Similar to x86's MONITOR/MWAIT or ARMv8's LDXR/WFE. It allows a
(task vs cpu) blocking implementation of:


  WAIT:
	while (READ_ONCE(*ptr) != val)
		cpu_relax;

  WAKE:
	WRITE_ONCE(*ptr, val);


With futex that turns into:


  WAIT:
	for (;;) {
		u32 t = READ_ONCE(*ptr);
		if (t == val)
			break;
		futex(WAIT, ptr, t);
	}

  WAKE:
	WRITE_ONCE(*ptr, val);
	futex(WAKE, ptr);


IOW, each WAKE corresponds to a STORE.

Extending the above to variable width, you'll see that:

	u32 var = 0xff;
	u32 *ptr = &var, val = 0xffff;

  WAIT:
	while (READ_ONCE(*ptr) != val)
		cpu_relax();

  WAKE:
	WRITE_ONCE(*(u8*)ptr+1, 0xff); // let's assume LE

will in fact release the WAIT. IOW, all WAIT cares about is that the
value it went to sleep on has changed. It doesn't care how many bits of
the variable changed or what size store made it happen.

It also works the other way:

	u8 var = 0, val = 1;
	u8 *ptr = &var;

  WAIT:
	while (READ_ONCE(*ptr) != val)
		cpu_relax();

  WAKE:
	WRITE_ONCE(*(u32 *)((unsigned long)ptr & ~0x3), 0x01010101);

That u32 store fills our @var with 1 and the WAIT terminates.

In neither example does @ptr (necessarily) match.

So I'll argue that, while the pure address mode is perhaps convenient,
it is not consistent.  In particular it allows some but disallows other
mixed size overlapping operations. Consistency would either allow or
disallow all.

Yes, being strict is perhaps a little more expensive, but I so prefer
strict and narrow semantics over weird and fuzzy semantics. Also, I
don't think it is actually that much more expensive.

Specifically, as you found, we have available space in
futex_key::offset, 2 more FUT_OFF_ bits would allow encoding 4 different
sizes (1,2,4,8 bytes).

Re REQUEUE, using 4 instead of 2 extra bits in the command word would
allow encoding 2 sizes, one for uaddr and one for uaddr2.

Thomas?
