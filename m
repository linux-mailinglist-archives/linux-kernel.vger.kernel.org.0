Yes, I think that you're right. IIUC the absence of
ARM64_CPUCAP_PERMITTED_FOR_LATE_CPU is what prevents that from
happening.

I'm afraid so!

I believe we need both ARM64_CPUCAP_OPTIONAL_FOR_LATE_CPU and
ARM64_CPUCAP_PERMITTED_FOR_LATE_CPU, so I guess we should be using
ARM64_CPUCAP_WEAK_LOCAL_CPU_FEATURE.

Does that sound right to you? ... or have I confused myself again?

Thanks,
Mark.
