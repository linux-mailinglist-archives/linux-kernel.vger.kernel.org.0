/dev/kmsg is one interface passing dictionary. The other is
netconsole. It is the only console with CON_EXTENDED flag set.

It just complicates the code because we need to store and read
the information separately.

I would double check with Linus that he would consider this as
breaking userspace.

IMHO, it is perfectly fine to add this support later in separate patch(set) if
really necessary. I can't imagine that anyone would depend on this
feature when bisecting kernel. We could discuss and handle this later.
At least after the merge window.

Interesting idea. I like it if it does not complicate the code too much.
