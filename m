It's not HW specific flag (like AMD freesync), I think can use this standar=

Yes, we can.
But DRM-KMS (the helpers) default doesn't support such light mode-set.
we can not rely on the helpers, but need to implement by ourselves.
Is it worth to do it?

My plan is:

First:
I think the key problem here is not how to enable VRR for our display,
but how to pass the VRR caps from the connector to our display.

And it's not only the VRR prblem but like the command_mode/dual-link
all the none standard connector features that needed by our HW.

Unlike the intel/amd/NV mostly they have their own transmitter HW
(and connector driver), So they can easily pass the info between
connector and display.

But for us that's the third part, and we can not do any assumption to
them, and for us they are the drm_connector, but we can not got these
infos via a drm_connector.

So I think we need a standard way to pass these private infos.

I plan to add a new query function to drm_bridge like

  (*query)(u64 query_id, xxx-type return_va);

and query_id is like the modifiers: first 8bit is vendor_id.

when the third part connector integrats to our display, if the
transmitter HW support the features that our display needed, they
can supply this query function to notify the caps support to us.
If the connector doesn't have this query, or query fail we treat
the feature is not support by this connector.

And For this VRR.

User only need to En/Dis VRR, Once komeda received Enable command
- query the connector for VFP range
  1. connector doesn't support VRR,  ignore or return error ?.
  2. got the VFP range, configure the display according the range.

Once the disable received, restore the mode vfp.

Thanks
