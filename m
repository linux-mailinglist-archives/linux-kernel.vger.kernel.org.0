Keep in mind that we generate a standalone DT only tree[1] with the
documentation, dts files and headers. So things should be structured
such that all the DT documentation could be built by itself without
dependencies on the 'kernel documentation'. I'm not asking for that to
be done in this series, but just don't do anything to make that
harder. I don't *think* have, but just want to make sure that's clear.

I was wondering what happened to the cover letter on v2...
