This and few other comments below are really valuable explanation.
I misunderstood how the list worked. I have to revisit it and
rethink my view on the patchset.

I think that we are talking about the same. If I remember correctly,
the main problem is that cmpxchg() is not reliable when the same
address might be used by the metadata and data.

For example, the code never know if it compared previous seq number
of it another CPU/NMI wrote there data (string) in the meantime.

It is quite likely.

I personally like /** */ description of public API functions. Also
html/pdf version looks nice even though I do not use them.

The thing is that both /** */ and .rst formats can be well readable
even in the source code. I guess that most existing developers read
only the source code.

Well, this discussion probably belongs to another thread. My wish
was just to make the commit message more verbose, please.

As I said, I do not have strong opinion. I could live with oldest, newest.
