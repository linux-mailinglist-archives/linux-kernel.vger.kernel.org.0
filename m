Eh, this would assume that someone hasn't compiled RPCC out of tree,
but this is probably me being pedantic.

So, I thought about this, and I don't think it works.  This appears to be a
solution for if RPM is not present.  If, in patch 3, I check for the clocks
property in the gcc DT and don't see it, and I add the fake XO as a result,
I'll end up with a namespace conflict with either GCC or RPMCC failing
to register XO since both will attempt it.

The issue is do we have RPM providing XO (ie patch 3) without a DT
routing it to GCC (ie patch 2).  Since we have patch 3, we know RPM is
going to provide XO.  We just might not have a handle to it to do the
probe_defer logic.

I think the solution is check the DT for the clocks property, if present use
that to attempt to grab XO.  Otherwise, attempt to grab XO from the system
map.  I'll try this in the next rev.

I'm not sure attempting to sidestep the RPM dependency is worthwhile.
Its not just GCC, but every clock controller that depends on XO, and thus
implicitly RPM.

I suspect any real system is going to have to have the RPM, just by the
nature of what the RPM controls that cannot be managed elsewhere,
such as BIMC.  At some point, a system is going to want to ramp up the
memory bus and DDR speeds to something more than the bare minimum.

Putting in a bunch of code to try to avoid depending on the RPM seems
like effort not well spent as its unlikely such code is going to be active.
