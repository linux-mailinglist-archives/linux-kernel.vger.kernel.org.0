Then this patch is not ok, as you are flooding the kernel log saying the
system is "broken" when this is just what it always has been like.  How
is anyone going to "fix" things?

You can adjust the default node to 0 as isn't that what always has
happened, but you can not claim it is a "error" that this is happening
because it is not an error, it's just the default operation.
