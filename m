Agree for the latter, but not the former - I do want to explain why it's
possible to configure out; see also below.

Yes, it's of course way too late now. Perhaps I should ask you to take
it via the printk tree? Anyway, let's see what we can agree to.

OK. I wasn't too happy about errcode anyway - but I wanted to avoid
"str" being in there to avoid anyone thinking it was a strerror(). So
"CONFIG_SYMBOLIC_ERRNAME" and errname() seems fine with the above
justification.

I am one such person, and while 3K may not be a lot, death by a thousand
paper cuts...

> I would personally enable it when CONFIG_PRINTK is enabled.

Agree. So let's make it 'default y if PRINTK'? These are only/mostly
useful when destined for dmesg, I can't imagine any of the sysfs/procfs
uses of vsprintf() to want this. So if somebody has gone to the rather
extremely length of disabling printk (which even I rarely do), they
really want the absolute minimal kernel, and would not benefit from this
anyway. While for the common case, it gets enabled for anyone that just
updates their defconfig and accepts new default values.

No, because by the time the kernel has grown too large for some target,
it's almost impossible to start figuring out which small pieces can be
chopped away with suitable config options, and even harder to get
upstream to accept such configurability ("why, that would only gain you
3K...").

Hm, ok, but I actually do it this way on purpose - I want to ensure that
the test where one passes a random not-zero-but-too-small buffer size
sometimes hits in the middle of the %p output, sometimes just before and
sometimes just after. The very reason I added test_printf was because
there were some %p extensions that violated the basic rule of
snprintf()'s return value and/or wrote beyond the provided buffer.

Not a big deal, so if you insist I'll break it up.

Well, we can certainly do that. However, I didn't want that for two
reasons: (1) I want plain %p to be more useful when passed an ERR_PTR.
Printing the value, possibly symbolically, doesn't leak anything about
kernel addresses, so the hashing is pointless and just makes the
printk() less useful - and non-repeatable across reboots, making
debugging needlessly harder. (2) With a dedicated extension, we have to
define what happens if a non-ERR_PTR gets passed as %pe argument. [and
(3), we're running out of %p<foo> namespace].

So, if you have some good answer to (2) I can do that - but if the
answer is "fall through to handling it as just a normal %p", well, then
we haven't really won much. And I don't see what else we could do -
print "(!ERR_PTR)"?

Yes, I think this is a good idea. But only for ERR_PTRs, for other
obviously-not-a-kernel-address pointer values (i.e. the < PAGE_SIZE
case) we still need some other string.

So how about I try to add something like this so that
would-be-dereferenced ERR_PTRs get printed symbolically in brackets,
while I move the check for IS_ERR() to after the switch() (i.e. before
handing over to do the hashing)? Then all ERR_PTRs get printed
symbolically - except for %px and possibly %pK which are explicitly
"print this value".

Yes, that's better. But somewhat out of scope for this patch.

Oh, yes, I never was a fan of the (einval) (efault) strings.
