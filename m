For the current arm64 implementation, probably not. For 32-bit it's 
still a DSB, which might in theory generate a bunch of coherency traffic 
synchronising with all the other CPUs each time, although unless you're 
counting every last microWatt even that's unlikely to be anything to 
worry about in practice. You *could* keep consistency with 
readl_relaxed_poll_timeout() instead, but you could equally argue the 
"use regular accessors for simplicity unless there's a provable benefit 
to using relaxed ones" angle. Up to you :)
