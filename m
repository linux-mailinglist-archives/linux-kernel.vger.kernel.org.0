I don't think the above description adequately describes one key problem
that the patch set addresses.

David Collins described the problem in an email late in the thread of
the first submission of this series.  Instead of providing a link to
that email, I am going to fully copy it here:

To paraphrase, the problem is:

   - bootloader enables a regulator for display
   - during Linux boot camera driver probes:
      * enable the regulator also used for display
      * disable the regulator
         + screen image is corrupted
         + display hardware enters bad state
   - later during Linux boot display driver probes:
      * enable the regulator, but too late

So the problem is an ordering dependency between the camera driver probe
and the display driver probe.

Or alternatively the problem could be seen as: the bootloader has enabled
a regulator for a device that the bootloader is aware of, but has not
communicated to the Linux regulator framework that the device requires
the regulator to remain enabled.

Thinking about the problem this way could lead to an entirely different
solution.
