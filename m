Agree, these two patchest are definitively overlapping in terms of
mechanisms and APIs to expose to userspace. You to guys seems to target
different goals but the general approach should be:

 - expose a single and abstract concept to user-space
   latency-nice or latency-tolerant as PaulT proposed at OSPM

 - map this concept in kernel-space to different kind of bias, both at
   wakeup time and load-balance time, and use both for RT and CFS tasks.

That's my understanding at least ;)

I guess we will have interesting discussions at the upcoming LPC to
figure out a solution fitting all needs.
