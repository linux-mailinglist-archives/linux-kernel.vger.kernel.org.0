Good, I think that's all we'll really need. I've not gone through the whole
series (yet!) so I might've missed AMCGCR being used.

I believe conveying the intent (a truth value) is more important than the
underlying storage size in this case. It mostly matters when dealing with
aggregates, but here it's just a free-standing variable.

We already have a few per-CPU boolean variables in arm64/kernel/fpsimd.c
and the commits aren't even a year old, so I'd go for ignoring sparse this
time around.
