Thanks for the confirmation.

Or add temporarily a late_initcall() to find all X-Surf boards using
zorro_find_device(), create fake zorro_device_id entries, and pass both
to pata_buddha_probe()?  A big ugly, but that should work.

Of course it should be tested ;-)
Converting zorro8390.c from a zorro driver to an MFD cell driver should
not require that many changes, most bugs should be caught by code review.
I already have a skeleton 8390-cell.c driver in my zorro-mfd branch.

That's something the user has to configure.
The Buddha MFD driver registers an "a1200-clockport" cell, which is
really a separate platform device.
The user writes the name of the actual driver to use to the device's
driver_override file in sysfs, after which the driver is bound
automatically.  See Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-platform,

The alternative would be to have multiple drivers matching against
"a1200-clockport", and the user modprobe'ing the correct one to use.
But that won't work with http://wiki.icomp.de/wiki/A500/A1000_clockport
and plugging in two different clock port boards.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
