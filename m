(3 pointers: 1 list_head + 1 function pointer)

I'm confused. The first patch was criticized for potentially adding
an extra pointer for every devm_clk_get (e.g. 800 bytes on a 64-bit
platform with 100 clocks).

Let's see. On arm64, ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is 128.

So basically, a struct devres looks like this on arm64:

	list_head.next
	list_head.prev
	dr_release_t
		.
		.
		.
	104 bytes of padding
		.
		.
		.
	data (flexible array)
		.
		.
		.
	padding up to 256 bytes


Basically, on arm64, every struct devres occupies 256 bytes, most of it
(typically 104 + 112 = 216) wasted as padding.

Hmmm, given how many devm stuff goes on in a modern platform, there
might be large savings to be had...

Assuming 10,000 calls to devres_alloc_node(), we would be wasting ~2 MB
of RAM. Not sure it's worth trying to save that?
