Hi All,
This patch is part of series [1] ("Add dual-LVDS panel support to EK874),
all the patches have been accepted from it except this one. I have fixed
Rob's comments in this version of the patch.

[1] https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11297589/

V7->8
 * Dropped ref to lvds.yaml, since the panel a dual channel LVDS, as a
   result the root port is called as ports instead of port and the child
   node port@0 and port@1 are used for even and odd pixels, hence binding
   has required property as ports instead of port.

v6->7
 * Added reference to lvds.yaml
 * Changed maintainer to myself
 * Switched to dual license
 * Dropped required properties except for ports as rest are already listed
   in lvds.panel
 * Dropped Reviewed-by tag of Laurent, due to the changes made it might not
   be valid.

v5->v6:
 * No change

v4->v5:
* No change

v3->v4:
* Absorbed patch "dt-bindings: display: Add bindings for LVDS
  bus-timings"
* Big restructuring after Rob's and Laurent's comments

v2->v3:
* New patch

+description: |
+  The IDK-2121WR from Advantech is a Full-HD dual-LVDS panel.
+  A dual-LVDS interface is a dual-link connection with even pixels traveling
+  on one link, and with odd pixels traveling on the other link.
+
+  The panel expects odd pixels on the first port, and even pixels on the
+  second port, therefore the ports must be marked accordingly (with either
+  dual-lvds-odd-pixels or dual-lvds-even-pixels).
+
