There are multiple problems with Broadwell and device-specific issues on 
suspend-resume - in which Cezary is involved. The tests are not 
automated so depend on people availability.

I tested this series last Friday and I didn't find any new problem on my 
side, so we should probably merge this series.

Everyone should be aware though that suspend-resume is far from stable 
on Broadwell, and if it works on Dell XPS 13 it doesn't work reliably on 
Chrome devices.
