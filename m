And unless I'm missing something, using %rcx to pass @leaf would still
satisfy the above, correct?  Ditto for saving/restoring %rbx.

I.e. a runtime that's designed to work with enclave's using a different
calling convention wouldn't be able to take advantage of being able to call
the vDSO from C, but neither would it take on any meaningful burden.
