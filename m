 system, asynchronous, interrupt, transaction abort, trace begin, trace end, and
 in transaction, respectively.
 
+Another interesting field that is not printed by default is 'ipc' which can be
+displayed as follows:
+
+	perf script --itrace=be -F+ipc
+
+There are two ways that instructions-per-cycle (IPC) can be calculated depending
+on the recording.
+
+If the 'cyc' config term (see config terms section below) was used, then IPC is
+calculated using the cycle count from CYC packets, otherwise MTC packets are
+used - refer to the 'mtc' config term.  When MTC is used, however, the values
+are less accurate because the timing is less accurate.
+
+Because Intel PT does not update the cycle count on every branch or instruction,
+the values will often be zero.  When there are values, they will be the number
+of instructions and number of cycles since the last update, and thus represent
+the average IPC since the last IPC for that event type.  Note IPC for "branches"
+events is calculated separately from IPC for "instructions" events.
+
+Also note that the IPC instruction count may or may not include the current
+instruction.  If the cycle count is associated with an asynchronous branch
+(e.g. page fault or interrupt), then the instruction count does not include the
+current instruction, otherwise it does.  That is consistent with whether or not
+that instruction has retired when the cycle count is updated.
+
+Another note, in the case of "branches" events, non-taken branches are not
+presently sampled, so IPC values for them do not appear e.g. a CYC packet with a
+TNT packet that starts with a non-taken branch.  To see every possible IPC
+value, "instructions" events can be used e.g. --itrace=i0ns
+
 While it is possible to create scripts to analyze the data, an alternative
 approach is available to export the data to a sqlite or postgresql database.
