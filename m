Are you sure this is really the case? I am either missing something here
or your test might simply be timing specific because

	GFP_KERNEL & (__GFP_FS | __GFP_IO) = true

so I really do not see how the current code could bail out on the test
you are patching so that the patch would make any change. The only real
difference this patch makes is to trigger events for __GFP_RECLAIM
allocations which could be GFP_NOIO. All non-sleepable allocations would
wake kswapd and that would in turn reclaim with _GFP_FS | __GFP_IO set
so the check doesn't change anything.

Am I missing something?
