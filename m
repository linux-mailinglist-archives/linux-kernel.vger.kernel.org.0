Hi

I have noticed that my SPF records where not in place after moving the server,
so it seems the mail didn't go to the mailing list. Hopefully that's fixed now.

The company i work for uses this chip as a base for multiple products.

We boot from NOR flash. That's why i didn't see a problem booting probably.

Yes i hope so too.

Oh my! Thats bad news.

This was just a dirty hack to verify that this is the problem.

We include the device tree file for this chip directly from kernel sources.
Which means that we are using the settings which are within the kernel tree in

linux-5.3-rc8/arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga.dtsi

The dts entries taken verbatim from the above file are:

nand0: nand@ff900000 {

};

        #address-cells = <1>;                   
        #size-cells = <0>;

        compatible = "altr,socfpga-pll-clock";  
        clocks = <&osc1>;                       
        reg = <0x40>; 
...
};

periph_pll: periph_pll@80 {
        #address-cells = <1>;

        clocks = <&osc1>, <&osc2>, <&f2s_periph_ref_clk>;
        reg = <0x80>; 
...
};

and from file: linux-5.3-rc8/arch/arm/boot/dts/socfpga_cyclone5.dtsi
clkmgr@ffd04000 {
        clocks {        
                osc1 {          
                        clock-frequency = <25000000>;
                };              
        };              
};  

So basically it boils down to osc1 set to 25MHz and osc2, f2s_periph_ref_clk
have a undefined frequency?

Currently i have no idea what the undefined frequencies in the device tree
result which frequency in the driver?

But the base frequency is at least nowhere near the 50MHz and 200MHz you
mentioned.

Best regards
Tim

Below the hack to get the platform booting again, which are the timings we need
in this case:
