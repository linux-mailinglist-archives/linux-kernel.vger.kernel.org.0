I believe u-boot tried at one point to instigate some kind of standard
placement of the kernel / dtb with respect to the available RAM, but
vendors tried hard to ignore u-boot and go their own way - resulting
in systems that didn't boot without customising various u-boot
environment variables.  It's very annoying when vendors ignore the
community...
