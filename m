The search inside find_lowest_rq() happens without any locks so I believe it
is expected to have races like this. In fact there is a comment in the code
saying "This test is optimistic, if we get it wrong the load-balancer
will have to sort it out" in select_task_rq_rt(). However, the push logic
as of today works only for overloaded case. In that sense, your patch fixes
this race for b.L systems. At the same time, I feel like tracking nonfit tasks
just to fix this race seems to be too much. I will leave this to Steve and
others to take a decision.

I thought of suggesting to remove the below check from select_task_rq_rt()

p->prio < cpu_rq(target)->rt.highest_prio.curr

which would then make the target CPU overloaded and the push logic would
spread the tasks. That works for a b.L system too. However there seems to
be a very good reason for doing this. see
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/539137/

The fact that a CPU is part of lowest_mask but running a higher prio RT
task means there is a race. Should we retry one more time to see if we find
another CPU?

Thanks,
Pavan
