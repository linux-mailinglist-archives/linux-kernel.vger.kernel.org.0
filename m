Hi James,

This conflicts with what I see in BSP irq mux code here:
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M4-bsp/blob/master/linux-rtk/drivers/irqchip/irq-rtd16xx.h

That does show UR0 as bit 2 for the iso irq mux, as for previous SoCs.
Is that code wrong, or does the same UART0 IP block have two alternative
interrupts for backwards compatibility? I therefore held back RTD1619
irq mux patches from my irqchip v4 series [1].

The BSP DT does assign non-mux interrupts to the UART node like you did:
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M4-bsp/blob/master/linux-rtk/arch/arm64/boot/dts/realtek/rtd16xx/rtd-16xx.dtsi
And I obviously trust that you tested your DT to produce serial output.


Also note how there are UR1_TO and UR2_TO (TO = timeout?) in addition to
regular UR1 and UR2 interrupts in the mux above, just as for RTD1295 and
RTD1195 (UR1/UR1_TO only). From my irqmux v4 series posted last night I
had to drop those additional interrupts property values from the DT [2],
as they violate mainline's DesignWare DT schema's maxItems 1 and would
require a new compatible string (and a driver patch to make use of it).
