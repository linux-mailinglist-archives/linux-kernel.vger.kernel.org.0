Or we just extend drm_cflush_pages with the cflushing we need (at least
for those arms where this is possible, let's ignore the others) and accept
for a few more years that dma-api doesn't fit?

Note this would need to be a full copypasta of what the arch code has
(since just exporting the function was shot down before), but I really
don't care about the resulting wailing if we do this.
