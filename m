Exactly. I think that my comment is just confusing. I wanted to say
that the order was important.

It was not obvious to me that kvm_check_and_clear_guest_paused() cleared
perior_ts and must be called before update_report_period_ts(). I spent
some time with debugging why the reshufled code stopped working ;-)

What about the following?

		/*
		 * Clear the guest paused flag on watchdog. Might clear
		 *  report_period_ts.
		 */
		kvm_check_and_clear_guest_paused();

		update_report_period_ts();

Sounds good.

Where is the timestamp updated unconditionaly, please?

I found that it happens, for example, in printk_stack_address() that
is hidden "deep" in show_stack().

To me, it looks obvious to reset/update the period when the current
period ended and we are about to report softlockup.

OK, it might create wrong assumtion that the updated timestamp will
really get used. It is not true because it will get reset inside
the above mentioned show_stack(). But is it really guaranteed
that the watchdog will be touched there?

IMHO, the explicit call makes the code more reliable and easier
to understand. The hidden touch() might get re(moved) at any time.

Thanks a lot for review.
