Why do you think Xen is stealing the memory in an odd way?

Doesn't deferred_init_mem_pfn_range_in_zone() return false when no free
memory is found? So exactly if the memory was added to memory.reserved
that will happen.

I guess the difference to a bare metal boot is that a Xen dom0 will need
probably more memory in early boot phase, so that issue is more likely
to occur.

In my case the system had two zones, where the 2nd zone had some free
memory. The search never made it to the 2nd zone as the search ended in
an endless loop for the 1st zone.
