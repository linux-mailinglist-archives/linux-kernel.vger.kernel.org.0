As your question shows, everyone gets this wrong and the build breaks
all the time (it's not "depends on framework", it's "depends on
framework || framework=n" - and everyone you'll talk to will be
puzzled as to why this is).

But consistently introducing this for clocks, regulators, pinctrl,
resets, etc should be a task so large that people will come out
educated from it - or whatever it is that one feels after fixing
thousands of Kconfig entries.

Odd or not, it's what we have in all these frameworks.
