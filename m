Google "UEFI Secure Boot" 
The patch for kernel lock down was from RedHat, which restricted MSRs!

Not sure why you call jumping hoops here. You are comparing debug tools
with run time service from kernel for Intel speed select.

This is not about tool. This tool is giving example how user spaces can
control SST features through a kernel interface which should work with
any distribution including home grown distros. And this interface is
not for testing like turbostat or similar. So if any orchestration
software can send same message as this tool and able to control SST
features whether there is MSR access is there or not.

Also you are missing feature for save/restore state after
suspend/resume.
