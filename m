But what happens as a consequence? We would have a 64 bit address
but wouldn't enable 64bit addressing, so presumably the hardware
would only use the bottom 32 bits of the address?

Things could get weird yes?

Or is there some failure that would occur before we trigger the transfer?
Is that what you're depending on?

Why is it worth not locking? How is it correct? To answer that way we invoke
all kinds of reasoning about multi-processing (interrupt handled on one core
while aspeed_xdma_start() is executing on another), value visibility and
instruction reordering (though as it happens the 2400, 2500 and 2600 are all
in-order). We'll trip ourselves up if there is eventually a switch to out-of-order
execution where the writes might be reordered and delayed until after
start_lock has been acquired in aspeed_xdma_start() by a subseqent transfer.
This line of reasoning is brittle exploitation of properties of the currently used
cores for no benefit. Finishing the DMA op isn't a hot path where you might
want to take some of these risks for performance, so we have almost zero
care for lock contention but we must always be concerned about correctness.

We avoid invoking all of those questions by acquiring the lock.

Fair enough.

Right. That's where I was going. I don't expect you to do that as part of this
patch series, but if you could separate this code out into separate patches
(dealing with the sdmc property in the devicetree binding as well) we can at
least concentrate on getting the core XDMA driver in and work out how to
move forward with configuring the memory controller later.

Right, but if you separate it out you'll get my reviewed-by on the core XDMA
patches much quicker :) You can convince me about it in slow-time.
