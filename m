Using SOC_ID means that going forward, userspace needs to learn about
the integration details of each SoC in order to identify a component. As
you said:

| As constantly checking what the SoC ID means throughout system components
| does not scale.

... and I think that equally applies to userspace in this case. Who knows how
many SoCs are going to have MMU-600?

I also know that SOC_ID is going to be optional, and I think it's near-certain
that someone will end up producing two SoCs exposing the same ID.

For system PMUs, I'd rather the system PMU driver exposed some sort of
implementation ID. e.g. the SMMU_ID for SMMU. We can give that a generic name,
and mandate that where a driver exposes it, the format/meaning is defined in
the documentation for the driver.

That can be namespace by driver, so e.g. keys would be smmu_sysfs_name/<id> and
ddrc_sysfs_name/<id>.

To expose the SMMU ID, surely that's just the driver? Or are there
implementations where the ID register is bogus and have to be overridden?

Thanks,
