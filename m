Ok, so double checking the schematic I do see separate Vbus-es for the
TypeC port and the TypeA ports, with the TypeC port one being controlled
by GPIO_202_VBUS_TYPEC. So ideally that gpio would be  controlled to
enable/disable vbus by the tcpm framework.

Right, so for the Type-A ports Vbus controlled by PRT_CTL1 enabling it depe=
nding
on host vs devices mode makes sense. But the Type-C one really should be
controlled by the tcpm framework.

Regards,

Hans

p.s.

Sorry for the confusion I was under the impression that there was only 1
Vbus enable for both Type-A and Type-C ports.
