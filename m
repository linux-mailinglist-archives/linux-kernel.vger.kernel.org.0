free_mapped_mem or free_backed_mem ? Even shorter forms like free_mapped or
free_backed might do as well. Do you have a particular preference here ? But
yes, sparse_vmap has been very much specific to vmemmap for these functions
which are now very generic in nature.

I had taken the liberty to carry them till V7 where the implementation has
been sort of structurally similar but as you mention, there have been some
basic changes in the approach since V7. Will drop these tags in next version
and request their fresh ACKs once again.

Makes sense, will do.

I am afraid 'page' is being used to hold pte_page(pte) extraction which
needs to be freed (sparse_vmap) as we are going to clear the ptep entry
in the next statement and lose access to it for good. We will need some
where to hold onto pte_page(pte) across pte_clear() as we cannot free it
before clearing it's entry and flushing the TLB. Hence wondering how the
'page' can be completely dropped.

Not sure I got this but are you suggesting for an 'if' statement here

if (sparse_vmap)
	page = pte_page(pte);

instead of the current assignment ?

page = sparse_vmap ? pte_page(pte) : NULL;

The two functions could be collapsed into a single one. But just wanted to
keep free_pxx_table() part which checks floor/ceiling alignment, non-zero
entries clear off the actual page table walking.

free_pte_table() freeing attempt actually belongs to free_empty_pte_table().
Yes, free_pte_table() part can be moved inside free_empty_pte_table() after
it's do..while(). Also s/free_pte_table/free_pte_page to make it sound more
distinct with respect to free_empty_pte_table(). Just that the pgtable page
freeing part is still wrapped in a helper function to hide it's details.

But if you prefer not to have these helpers free_pxx_page() and directly
encode the second step in free_empty_pxx_table(), then will that instead.
