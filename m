OK, updated branch is in the same place; changes: __futex_atomic_op{1,2}
turned into unsafe_atomic_op{1,2}, with "goto on error" folded into those.
And pointless reload removed from cmpxchg loop in unsafe_atomic_op2().

Sorry about the fuckup when sending that patchset ;-/  It ended up cc'd to
x86 list instead of the futex one; Message-Id of the beginning of the
thread is <20200327022836.881203-1-viro@ZenIV.linux.org.uk>.
