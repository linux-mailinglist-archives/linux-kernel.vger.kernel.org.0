This patch adds PMU events for AMD Zen2 core based processors, namely,
Matisse (model 71h), Castle Peak (model 31h) and Rome (model 2xh), as
documented in the AMD Processor Programming Reference for Matisse [1].
Zen2 adds some additional counters that are not present in Zen1 and
events for them have been added in this patch. Some counters have also
been removed for Zen2 thatwere previously present in Zen1 and have been
confirmed to always sample zero on zen2. These added/removed counters
have been omitted for brevity but can be found here:
https://gist.github.com/thakkarV/5b12ca5fd7488eb2c42e451e40bdd5f3

Note that PPR for Zen2 [1] does not include some counters that were
documented in the PPR for Zen1 based processors [2]. After having tested
these counters, some of them that still work for zen2 systems have been
preserved in the events for zen2. The counters that are omitted in [1]
but are still measurable and non-zero on zen2 (tested on a Ryzen 3900X
system) are the following:

PMC 0x000 fpu_pipe_assignment.{total|total0|total1|total2|total3}
PMC 0x004 fp_num_mov_elim_scal_op.*
PMC 0x046 ls_tablewalker.*
PMC 0x062 l2_latency.l2_cycles_waiting_on_fills
PMC 0x063 l2_wcb_req.*
PMC 0x06D l2_fill_pending.l2_fill_busy
PMC 0x080 ic_fw32
