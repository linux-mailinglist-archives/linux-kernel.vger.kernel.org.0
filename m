Retaining both interfaces is arguably the right solution. It would be
nice if we didn't have to, but the first bfq variant was incompatible
with the in-kernel one, so we'll always have that out in the wild.
Adding everything to stable doesn't work, as we still have existing
kernels out there with the interface. In fact, in some ways that's
worse, as you definitely don't want interfaces to change between two
stable kernels.

I know it's not ideal, and some better initial planning would have
made it better, but we have to deal with the situation as it stands
now.
