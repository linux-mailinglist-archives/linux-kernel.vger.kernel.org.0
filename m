Just noticed that WP has to be de-asserted 100 ns (tWW) before issuing
the command cycle, so it might have a minor impact on the perfs (let's
be honest, 100ns is nothing compared to the page transfer/erase time
so I don't think it's a good reason for not re-asserting the pin after
each write program operation).
