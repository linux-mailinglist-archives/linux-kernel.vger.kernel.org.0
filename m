Subject: [PATCH 1/6] ARM: dts: STi: Switch to SPDX header
Date:   Tue, 11 Jun 2019 09:29:16 +0200
Message-Id: <20190611072921.2979446-2-lkundrak@v3.sk>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.21.0
In-Reply-To: <20190611072921.2979446-1-lkundrak@v3.sk>
References: <20190611072921.2979446-1-lkundrak@v3.sk>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The original license text had a typo ("publishhed") which would be
likely to confuse automated licensing auditing tools. Let's just switch
to SPDX instead of fixing the wording.
