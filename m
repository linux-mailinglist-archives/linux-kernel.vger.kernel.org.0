Why?  What's so special about that device instance?

For example, why not instead have a poll_interval sysfs attribute for
all hubs that can be written from userspace?  Then people could reduce
the autoresume latency for any device they want.

Why don't you want to change the behavior?  Or allow the user to change 
the behavior?

If it makes sense to to save power for your built-in touchpad device, 
why doesn't it also make sense to save power for other external HIDs?

All right, that's a good reason.  But doesn't it apply just as well to 
other devices, not only your built-in touchpad?
