Well...  everything from default_rootfs/populate_rootfs call (incidentally,
stuff starting to leak into rootfs_initcall level shouldn't be mixed
with those two, but that's a separate story) and on to the end of
kernel_init_freeable() could be forked; the other bit (actual execve
attempts in the end of kernel_init()) must be in PID 1.

The problem is not just CC_CAN_LINK, it's the damn size of binaries...

klibc is not in mainline and I hadn't heard of attempts to get it into the
kernel git tree for quite a few years.  Whether this "just call sys_...()
instead of doing normal syscalls" is a stopgap measure until that happens
or something more permanent, the effect is the same - not poking in the
kernel internals from code with lousy test coverage...
