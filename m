Good point!

What we really want to do is to just schedule the work and not include
to set the sdio_irq_pending flag. Actually, the flag may have been
set, in case a host driver have called sdio_signal_irq() when the SDIO
card was suspended - but that is the intention.

Thanks for pointing out the issue, I will re-spin and fix it!

Kind regards
Uffe
