Cryptosystems with greater flexibility can have new kinds of
vulnerabilities arise from the greater complexity. The first sort of
thing that comes to mind is a downgrade attack like from TLS. I think
you're protected from this because the mode cannot be negotiatied at run
time, but in general it's security sensitive code so I'd like it to be
as simple as possible.

Yes, because I expect the scheme would change very, very rarely.

I still feel like this is holding onto ongoing complexity for very
little gain, but perhaps this is because I can't picture a specific
change that would actually require a wholesale change to the scheme.

You mention new features, support for new authentication mechanisms, and
addition of new variables.

 - New features is a bit too generic to answer specifically. In general
   I accept that there exists some new feature that would be
   sufficiently backwards-incompatible as to require a new version. I
   just can't think of one off the top of my head and so I'm not
   convinced it's worth the complexity. Did you have something in mind?

 - By support for new authentication mechanisms, I assume you mean new
   mechanisms for authenticating variable updates? This is communicated
   in edk2 via the attributes field. Looking at patch 5 from the skiboot
   series:

+ * When the attribute EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS is set,
+ * then the Data buffer shall begin with an instance of a complete (and
+ * serialized) EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2 descriptor.

   Could a new authentication scheme be communicated by setting a
   different attribute value? Or are we not carrying attributes in the
   metadata blob?

 - For addition of new variables, I'm confused as to why this would
   require a new API - wouldn't it just be exposed in the normal way via
   opal_secvar_get(_next)?

I guess I also somewhat object to calling it a 'backend' if we're using
it as a version scheme. I think the skiboot storage backends are true
backends - they provide different implementations of the same
functionality with the same API, but this seems like you're using it to
indicate different functionality. It seems like we're using it as if it
were called OPAL_SECVAR_VERSION.

Seems reasonable. I'm thinking specifically about the kernel loaded
after skiroot; and yes, on reflection just failing to boot is the only
sensible thing you can do.
