Well, if you are talking about just this patch, it's not needed unless
you also merge the rest of the Apple T2 support patches, which some
people I'm sure would like but I think Christoph is a bit cold feet
about (I don't care either way).

If you are talking about the whole series, give me a day or two to
respin with the added check that Keith requested (I believe his ack is
for a respin with the check so setting the IO queue too small doesn't
kill the driver).

Cheers,
Ben.
