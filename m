With 'auto_online_blocks' interface you don't need the udev rule. David
is trying to make it more versatile.

Yes - in theory, very unlikely - in practice.

The root cause of the problem here is adding more memory to the system
requires memory (page tables, memmaps,..) so if your system is low on
memory and you're trying to hotplug A LOT you may run into OOM before
you're able to online anything. With bare metal it's usualy not the
case: servers, which are able to hotplug memory, are usually booted with
enough memory and memory hotplug is a manual action (you need to insert
DIMMs!). But, if you boot your server with e.g. 4G, almost exhaust it
and then try to hotplug e.g. 256G ... well, OOM is almost guaranteed.
With virtual machines it's very common (e.g. with Hyper-V VMs) to boot
them with low memory and hotplug it (automatically, by some management
software) when neededm thus the problem is way more common.
