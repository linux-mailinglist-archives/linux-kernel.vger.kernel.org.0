To focus on the point, I rearranged the order a little. Suppose your following
comments is explaining the above behavior.

   I've illustrated how two heuristics (reusing-old and sharing-prev) _could_ work together.
   But they both are optional.
   
   At cloning first vma SRC1 -> DST1 there is no prev to share anon vma,
   thus works common code which _could_ reuse old vma because it have to.
   
   If there is no old anon-vma which have to be reused then DST1 will allocate
   new anon-vma (AV1) and it will be used by DST2 and so on like on your picture.

I agree with your 3rd paragraph, but confused with 2nd.

At cloning first vma SRC1 -> DST1, there is no prev so anon_vma_clone() would
pick up a reusable anon_vma. Here you named it AV_OLD_1. This looks good to
me. But I am not sure why you would picked up AV_OLD_2 for DST2? In parent,
SRC1 and SRC2 has the same anon_vma, AV0. So in child, DST1 and DST2 could
also share the same anon_vma, AV_OLD_1.

Sorry for my poor understanding, would you mind giving me more hint on this
change?
