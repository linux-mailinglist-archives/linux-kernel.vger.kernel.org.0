Yep!

Well, it is rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock() that matters
for this case rather than the callback.  But yes, given in_irq(),
rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_unlock() would need to have executed
from a hardware interrupt handler.  And would need to get one of the
->rcu_read_lock_special bits set somehow.

But you can use smp_call_function() to invoke a function that runs in
hardware interrupt handler context, and you can do this within either
rcuperf or rcutorture.

And yes, this line of reasoning did inform at least some of my skepticism
surrounding your initial patch, in case you were wondering about some
of my earlier questions.  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
