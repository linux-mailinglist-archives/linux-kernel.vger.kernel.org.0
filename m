Yes, then I think we have solved the behavioural problem of Linux, and it s=
eems to come down to the GNU idol, that seems based on Morphine Psychosis. =
And such the worst Stallman fans, have irate behaviour.

And much have pointed to that already, and much criticism done, and indeed =
the GNU idol should be gone.

And indeed I concluded this a while back, and suggested a Fair Labour=C2=
=A0 direction for the OS instead. And replacing LSD culture, with Intercult=
ure, and Islam as the Bible is altered with Thorian belief, similar to LSD.=
 then we keep the relevant of developments, and replace the irrelevant with=
 interculture. And indeed the "acid" type never could do finances. Getting =
the Thor/Odin out, with it sectunrest and reality in. (Nor could they do ma=
stering indeed, and rather than loudnesswar, we do suggest -10dB RMS master=
s too :)).

Peace (Go With Thee), as was the original greeting, and As-Salam is indeed =
a name of The Divine.

Eyx OS
