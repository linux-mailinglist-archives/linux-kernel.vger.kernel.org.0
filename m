I'm not saying it's easy. But getrandom() is documented as only
returning data after it has been initialized, which is an
important property of that interface and the main reason to switch
to it. And it seems that because someone's laptop hung during boot
because it doesn't find enough entrpoy is enough to break the
security of the rest. It seems that the only important thing is
that applications don't stop working, because it's clearly visible
that it's not working. Returning data before it's been initialized
doesn't have the effect of being visibly broken, but it's just as
broken, which is in my opinion worse.

And returning data before it's been initialized will only make
that situtation worse. We can only hope that by refusing to return
data the idiot will properly fix it.

If the hardware can't provide it, the kernel shouldn't just pretend
the hardware did provide it.

And I think it's not a kernel problem but a combination of
hardware, configuration and user space problem. The kernel can of
course be improved, and I'm sure it will.

I wonder if it's useful to extend getrandom() to provide an option
where the application can indicate it doesn't care about security
and just wants some number, like what /dev/urandom provides but
then as a system call. Other options could be that you're happy
with to get data after got an estimated 64 bit of entropy.

I don't trust it much either. And I think we should at least try
to estimate how much entropy it actually provides on various
systems, knowing that there will probably be systems where it
provides much less than what we think it does.

I'm willing to help analyze data if people can provide a list
of TSCs that are being added. The more samples the better. I think
you want to do this on an idle system.
