You are still mixing the pasted lockdep report and other situations
that will not get reported because of the first one.

We believe that the pasted report is pasted is false positive. And we
are against complicating the code just to avoid this false positive.

Are you sure that the workaround will not create real deadlocks
or races?

I see two realistic possibilities:

   + Make printk() always deferred. This will hopefully happen soon.

   + Improve lockdep so that false positives could get ignored
     without complicating the code.

Best Regards,
Petr
