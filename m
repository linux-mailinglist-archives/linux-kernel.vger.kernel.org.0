... while also leaking memory, right?

In my view, option 2 or 4 would have been preferable. Were there
specific technical reasons to not go down either of those routes? I'm
not sure that minimizing changes is the right rout given that this same
problem presumably applies to other architectures, which will need to be
fixed.

Do we know why we aren't seeing issues on other architectures? e.g. is
the issue possible but rare (and hence not reported), or masked by
something else (e.g. the layout of the kernel VA space)?

I'd like to solve the underyling issue before we start adding new
functionality.

Could you please share how you've tested this?

Having instructions so that I could reproduce this locally would be very
helpful.

Thanks,
Mark.
