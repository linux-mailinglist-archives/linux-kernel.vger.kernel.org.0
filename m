I wonder whether this would not introduce side effect for some legacy
drivers. Some rproc platforms can have a memory region defined but not
used for the virtio buffers which is allocated in the Linux default
memory pool.

If the aim is to minimize impact in the core part, the solution i proposed
in V1 using rproc_of_resm_mem_entry_init seems a good default candidate too.
The constraint would be that the platform driver has to pre-register
vdev<X>buffer reserved memory associated for a max number of vdev.
This max would limit the number of vdev that a remote firmware can request.
Also not very flexible more that the index 0, as managed at platform level.

Having a default name or a default index seems to me a good compromise...
One advantage of the default name (in this case not rproc->name) is the 
ability to define the memory region in a resource table carveout, instead
of a static definition in DT.
