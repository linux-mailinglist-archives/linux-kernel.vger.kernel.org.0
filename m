Hm I thought the cma regions are configured in DT? How does that work if
it's not using DT?

Why do you have a CMA region for the 2nd board if you don't need it?
_That_ sounds like some serious memory waster, not a few lines of code
loaded for nothing :-)

Yeah, I guess I'm disagreeing on whether dma-buf heaps are core or not.

I was working under the assumption that you're only exporting the symbols
for other heaps, and keep the current ones in-tree. Are there even any
out-of-tree dma-buf heaps still? out-of-tree and legit different use-case
I mean ofc, not just out-of-tree because inertia :-)
