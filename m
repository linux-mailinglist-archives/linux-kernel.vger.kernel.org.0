Right, CPU capacity can solve the problem of indicating the thermal throttle to the scheduler.
AFAIU, the patchset from Thara changes CPU capacity to reflect Thermal headroom of the CPU.
This is a nice mitigation but,
1. Sometimes a single task is responsible for the Thermal heatup of the core, reducing the
   CPU capacity of all the CPUs in the core is not optimal when just moving such single
   task to other core can allow us to remain within thermal headroom. This is important
   for the servers especially where there are upto 8 threads.
2. Given the implementation in the patches and its integration with EAS, it seems difficult
   to adapt to servers, where CPU capacity itself is in doubt.

Agree. But this should break in certain conditions like when we have multiple tasks
in a core with almost equal utilization among which one is just doing vector operations.
LB can pick and move any task with equal probability if the capacity is reduced here.

Can you please elaborate on why not to consider active balance for latency sensitive tasks?
Because, sometimes finding a thermally cool core is beneficial when Turbo frequency
range is around 20% above rated ones.

yes I do care for latency and throughput both. :-)
but I'm wondering how uclamp can solve the problem for throughput.
If I make the thermally hot tasks to appear bigger than other tasks then reducing
CPU capacity can allow such tasks to move around the chip.
But this will require the utilization value to be relatively large compared to the other
tasks in the core. Or other task's uclamp.max can be lowered to make such task rotate.
If I got it right, then this will be a difficult UCLAMP usecase from user perspective, right?
I feel like I'm missing something here.
