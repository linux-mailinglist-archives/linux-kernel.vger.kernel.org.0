If you look closely at the proposed allocator, my blocks can be much
larger than 7 bit. In fact, it start with a single block of
MAX_LOCKDEP_CHAIN_HLOCKS entries.

That said; I don't think you need to encode the size at all. All we need
to do is encode the chain_blocks[] index (and stick init_block in that
array). That should maybe even fit in a single u16.

Also, if we store that in the first and last 'word' of the free range,
we can detect both before and after freespace.

I'm thinking 1 entry isn't much of a chain. My brain is completely fried
atm, but are we really storing single entry 'chains' ? It seems to me we
could skip that.
