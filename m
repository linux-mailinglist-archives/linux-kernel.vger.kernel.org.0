Yes, but for VRX200, reset controller registers include some other misc 
registers. At that time,

hardware doesn't use chiptop concept, they put some misc registers into 
CGU/RCU which makes it quite messy.

We also prefer to have 0x10~0x1c. However, when developing VRX200, 0x18, 
0x20 and other address had been used by other registers. system becomes 
more complex, need more reset bits for new modules, then hardware just 
added them to any available place. From another angle, hardware people 
also tried to keep backward compatible with old products like Danube.

As I mentioned, some other misc registers are put into RCU even they 
don't belong to reset functions. In MIPS, global software reset handled 
in arch/mips/, only recently, this situation changed. This means we have 
at least two places to access this module.

Reset status check is there. regmap_read_poll_timeout to check status 
big. Status register offset <4) from request register. For legacy, there 
is one exception, we can add soc specific data to handle it.

This is most tricky and ugly part for VRX200/Danube. Do you have any 
idea to handle this nicely?
