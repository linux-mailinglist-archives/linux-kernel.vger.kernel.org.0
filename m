The separate documentation in
Documentation/core-api/printk-ringbuffer.rst references this so it
automatically shows up in the kernel docs. An external reference
requires the DOC keyword.

Maybe the memory barrier descriptions do not belong in the kernel docs?

Sorry. I really have no feel about what (or how) exactly I should
document the memory barriers. I think the above comments make sense when
someone understands the details of the implementation. But perhaps it
should describe things such that someone without knowledge of the
implementation would understand what the memory barriers are for? That
would significantly increase the amount of text as I would have to
basically explain the implementation.

I would appreciate it if you could point out a source file that
documents its memory barriers the way you would like to see these memory
barriers documented.
