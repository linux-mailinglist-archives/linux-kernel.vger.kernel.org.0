We have:
1. missed annotation with changing codegen.
2. missed annotation with non-changing codegen.
3. missed mutex with changing codegen.
4. missed mutex with non-changing codegen.

One can arguably say that 2 is less important than 1. But then both 3
and 4 are not low priority under any circumstances. And we don't have
any means to distinguish 1/2 from 3/4.
In this situation I don't see how "changing codegen" vs "non-changing
codegen" gives us any useful signal.

Assuming we have some signal for lower priority, the only useful way
of using this signal that I see is throwing lower priority bugs away
automatically for now (not reporting on syzbot). Because if we do
report all bugs and humans need to look at all of them anyway, this
signal is not too useful. If am already spending time on a report, I
can as well quickly prioritize it much more precisely than any
automatic scheme.

If we are not reporting lower priority bugs, we cannot offer to
classify "missed mutexes" as lower priority.
