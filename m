Are you sure you want to export this to the user? Not sure it is easily
understandable and tunable... I'm not against but I would have troubles
tuning it myself, unless using the documented value. Maybe you should
explain more how to derive it?

The rest looks fine, let's see if Rob agrees. Maybe he will request a
yaml schema; in this case you can check sunxi NAND bindings which
already have been converted.
