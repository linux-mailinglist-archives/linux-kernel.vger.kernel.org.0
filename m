Android has a "zygote" process that starts up the whole Java
environment with a bunch of libraries before entering into a loop that
fork()s off a child every time the user wants to launch an app. So all
the apps, and even browser renderer processes, on the device share
many CoW VMAs. See
<https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/memory-overview#SharingRAM>.

I think Chrome on Linux desktop systems also forks off renderers from
a common zygote process after initializing libraries and so on. See
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/docs/linux/zygote.md>.
(But they use a relatively strict seccomp sandbox that e.g. doesn't
permit MADV_PAGEOUT.)
