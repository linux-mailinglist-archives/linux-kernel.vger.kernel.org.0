It is already an expensive development practice if developers need to rely o=
n someone else to figure out their own bugs in linux-next. linux-next is for=
 integration testing, but majority of those regressions I had to deal with n=
owadays have nothing to do with integration, i.e., interaction with other su=
bsystems.

Sure, the world will still be running, but good luck on solely rely on revie=
wing with bare eyes before merging.

Of course, that helps but it is a culture that very difficult to change now.=
 How many times I saw even high-profile developers proudly sent out patches l=
abeled =E2=80=9Cno testing=E2=80=9D explicitly and implicitly ?

Your generalizations of things make me sorrow.

Surely, most of people probably don=E2=80=99t care about those endless bugs b=
ecause Linux is a monopoly in data center and open source and it is always l=
ike this since Linux was born as a hobby project.=
