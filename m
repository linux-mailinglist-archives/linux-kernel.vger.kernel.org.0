Guilty as charged :-). In general we do not expect microcode updates to 
remove any cpuid bits (Not that it hasn't happened, but it slipped through
the cracks). 

microode updates should be of 3 types.

- Only loadable from BIOS (Only via FIT tables)
- Suitable for early load (things that take cpuid bits for e.g.)
- Suitable for late-load. (Where no cpuid bits should change etc).

Today the way we load after a stop_machine() all threads in the system are
held hostage until all the cores have done the update. The thread sibling
is also in the rendezvous loop. 

Do you think we still have that risk with a sibling thread? 
(Assuming future ucodes don't do weird things like what happened in 
that case where a cpuid was removed via an update)

Cheers,
Ashok
