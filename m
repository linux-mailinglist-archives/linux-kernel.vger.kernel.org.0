Unfortunately I stopped reading at this point. It depends on another series
entirely and they really need to be presented together instead of relying
on searching mail archives to find other patches to try assemble the full
picture :(. Ideally each stage would have supporting data showing roughly
how it behaves at each major stage. I know this will be a pain but the
original NUMA balancing had the same problem and ultimately started with
one large series that got the basics right followed by other series that
improved it in stages. That process is *still* ongoing today.
