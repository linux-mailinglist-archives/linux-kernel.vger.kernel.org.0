dataring_pop() is adjusting the tail. dataring_push() is adjusting the
head. These operations are handled (ordered) separately. They do not
need be happening in lockstep. They don't need to be happening on the
same CPU.

If CPU0 issues an smp_wmb() after moving the tail and (after seeing the
moved tail) CPU1 issues an smp_wmb() after updating the head, it is
still possible for CPU2 to see the head move (and possibly even overtake
the tail) before seeing the tail move.

If a CPU didn't move the tail but _will_ move the head, only a full
memory barrier will allow _all_ observers to see the tail move before
seeing the head move.

I did not write that. I wrote (emphasis added):

    The full memory barrier ensures that all other observers will see
    what _this_ CPU sees before any of _its_ future changes are seen.

> These barriers need to be symmetric.

They are. The comments for fB list the pairs (all being
smp_mb()/smp_rmb() pairings).

It's not about racing to update the head. It's about making sure that
_all_ CPUs observe that a datablock was invalidated _before_ observing
that _this_ CPU started modifying other shared variables. And again,
this CPU might _not_ be the one that invalidated the datablock
(i.e. moved the tail).
