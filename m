Earlier, we had discussed about it in our team.  There are no plans to

upstream mips based platform code, past up-streaming efforts for mips

platforms were also dropped. GRX350/GRX550/VRX200 are all mips

based platforms. Plan is to upstream only x86 based platforms. In-fact,

i had removed GRX & other older SoCs support from this driver before

sending for review. So we can consider only x86 based LGM family of

SoCs for this driver & all of them will be reusing same IP.

IMHO, it will not hurt any other existing x86 platform but enabling it for

x86 unconditionally also doesn't sound like a good idea. I now get your

point that enabling OF_EARLY_FLATTREE here is a bit odd. I will remove

it in next patch.
