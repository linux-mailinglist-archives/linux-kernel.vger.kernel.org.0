Hi Arnaldo,

For this specific case, I'm not sure how much traction or value there 
would be since we're just adding some missing events for custom IP.

But I do agree that more review of JSONs from the community is required 
- as I brought up here regarding a recent addition: 
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/749a0b8e-2bfd-28f6-b34d-dc72ef3d3a74@huawei.com/

Can we enforce that at least linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org and/or 
get_maintainer.pl results is cc'ed on anything ARM specific as a start?

Cheers,
John
