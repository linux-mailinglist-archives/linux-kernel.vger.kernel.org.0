Every time you add something to allow higher priority processes to run
with less latency you add overhead. By just adding that spinlock check
or to migrate a process to a idle cpu will add a measurable overhead,
and as you state, distros won't like that.

It's a constant game of give and take.

BTW, I believe distros compile with "CONFIG_IRQ_FORCED_THREADING" which
means if you add to the kernel command line "threadirqs" the interrupts
will be run as threads. Which allows for even more preemption.
