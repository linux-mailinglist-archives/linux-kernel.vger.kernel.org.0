Thanks, and no worries, I consider all this v5.5 material anyway.

If nothing else, I would appreciate you making sure I didn't do anything
stupid in the interval_tree_generic.h lookup changes.

No, not this year; perhaps lsfmm (although that's not for a while).

I think you're right, I will double check this. I think we only wanna do
the RADEON_GPU_PAGE_SIZE division when soffset is non-zero.

Yes, but I wanted to leave it with the least amount of changes. There are plenty
of places that could use interval_tree_foreach helpers, like the vma tree has.

I considered it as well.

That's fair enough.

I'll see what I can do, but yeah it might be too much of a pain for
the benefits.
