In this case the 'arg' parameter is actually a private 'struct 
snd_sof_dev', as shown below [1]. We probably want to keep this 
relatively opaque, this is a context that doesn't need to be exposed to 
the SoundWire code.

The dai and params are indeed cases where we could use stronger types, 
they are snd_soc_dai and hw_params respectively. I don't recall why the 
existing code is this way, Vinod and Sanyog may have the history of this.

I have no preference, so in this case I will go with consistency with 
existing code, which uses the suggested style for all IPCs.

I was trying to avoid a confusion here, we have config->dai_index which 
are shared concepts between topology and firmware, and dai->id which is 
shared between topology and machine driver (which refers to the dai in 
the dai_link which has its own .id). In topology files we have the three 
indices and of course after a couple of weeks I can't recall which one 
maps to what.
I am afraid DAI ID might be confused with dai_index. If there are 
suggestions on this I am all ears, all I care about is avoiding 
ambiguity and having to ask Ranjani what index this really is :-)
