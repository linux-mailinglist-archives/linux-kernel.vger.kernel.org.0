Hi, All

I'm still asking for more comments.

By now, I have received some precious comments, mainly due to my
stupid naming mistakes and a misleading changelog. I should have
updated all these with a new series patches. But I hope I
can polish more in the new patchset with more suggestions from
valuable comments, especially in x86,scheduler,percpu and rcu
areas.

I'm very obliged to hear anything.

Thanks
Lai
