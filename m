Right, that was just my first proposal, but I am not confident that I
understood everybody's requirements. I don't think the distro people
had much time to to test things out.

One possible shortcoming with that patch is no per-symbol version. The=20
distro may break an ABI for a security fix, but they don't want to break
all out of tree modules if it's an obscure ABI. The counter argument to=20
that is they should just rename the symbol in their kernel for such=20
cases, so I didn't implement it without somebody describing a good
requirement.

I guess. Do we really need to merge and wait? If they _really_ want it,
and won't put in effort to convert their kernel packaging, then they
can carry the patch and support it quite easily. The code doesn't
change frequently so it should not be a big roadblock

I'm more concerned about developer and hobbyists etc who don't have the
resources. But IIRC we are satisfied that git version has superseded
the benefits of modversions for that case now.

Thanks,
Nick
