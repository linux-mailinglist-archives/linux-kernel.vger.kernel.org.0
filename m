Indeed. And I've recently found this exact design blunder on a brand 
new
Amlogic SoC, where the per-core interrupts have been OR'd together.
And not just for the PMU! It is the same situation for the GIC, CTI,
and a couple of other things. The only sane interrupts are the timers.

(sound of a PCB hitting the bin...)
