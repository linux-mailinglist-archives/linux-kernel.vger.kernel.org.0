Yeah, that's why no error checking on the invocation. The function will
return an error value if there are no pools defined, which we shall
ignore and will be a no-op.

I see your point. I would think that if your rproc device has multiple
regions to begin with, then it is already expecting certain behavior
from certain pools, and will have to interpret them either based on name
or index.

OK, how about just storing a default index in rproc struct that the
individual platform drivers can override if the memory region is not at
index 0. Most drivers that just define a single pool need not do
anything special as this variable shall be initialized to 0 in
rproc_alloc(), and much simpler code compared to a name-based lookup.

Something like
  of_reserved_mem_device_init_by_idx(dev, np, rproc->def_vdevbuf_id);
