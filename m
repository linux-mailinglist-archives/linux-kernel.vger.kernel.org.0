Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: arm: Extend SCMI to support new reset protocol
Date:   Fri,  9 Aug 2019 15:40:27 +0100
Message-Id: <20190809144027.20912-1-sudeep.holla@arm.com>

SCMIv2.0 adds a new Reset Management Protocol to manage various reset
states a given device or domain can enter. Extend the existing SCMI
bindings to add reset protocol support by re-using the reset bindings
for both reset providers and consumers.

Hi Rob,

I am posting this separately to avoid reposting the driver patches that
are already reviewed/asked. I need your ack to take the changes for v5.4
I might have messed up something that it got missed from your patchworks
Full series @[1]

Sudeep
