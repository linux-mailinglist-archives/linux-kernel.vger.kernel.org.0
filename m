We do need a clear way of indicating that SW wants to override so HW
state is ignored.

That is not good enough for us. We need both HW and SW based role switching.

Can we introduce a new state (e.g. "auto") in usb_role_switch. This would
explicitly indicate the driver to do HW based switching.

This way we don't need to depend on connect/disconnect events and can
do role switch tests even without cable/device connected.
