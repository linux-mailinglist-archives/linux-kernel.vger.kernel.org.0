I have to admit that I expected more races. But the most intuitive ones
are avoided by the 2nd for-cycle in __unregister_console(). As a
result, most operations are ignored when the console was
already unregistered in parallel.

Anyway, it is really tricky. My head is still spinning around it.
The console_lock handling is really hard to follow. And it is
error prone.

To make it clear. The code has already been tricky. Your patchset has
a potential. It fixes some races but it still keeps the code tricky
anoter way.

OK, all these nasty hacks are needed only because we need to flush
the messages to the console.

Much cleaner solution would be to refactor console_unlock()
and allow to handle existing messages using a separate function.
It is perfectly safe to flush all existing messages to all registered
consoles without releasing console_lock.

How does that sound, please?

Petr
