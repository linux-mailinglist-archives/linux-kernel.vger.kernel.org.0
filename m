Do we have an idea of roughly how long a CPU _usually_ takes to
transition state?

i.e. are we _just_ missing the transition the first time we call
AFFINITY_INFO?

Could we please make that:

			pr_info("CPU%d killed (polled %d times)\n", cpu, i + 1);

Hmm, so now we'll wait somewhere between 10ms and 100ms before giving up
on a CPU depending on how long we actually sleep for each iteration of
the loop. That should be called out in the commit message.

That could matter for kdump when you have a large number of CPUs, as in
the worst case for 256 CPUs we've gone from ~2.6s to ~26s. But tbh in
that case I'm not sure I care that much...

In the majority of cases I'd hope AFFINITY_INFO would return OFF after
an iteration or two.

Thanks,
Mark.
