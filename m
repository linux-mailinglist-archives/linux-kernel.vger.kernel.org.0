Resending again due to HTML. Sorry about it, the darn thing keeps
getting turned on for some reason!

Android will start using this. So there's definitely going to be a lot
of motivation for people to start using this and testing this.

I'm also thinking we should start rejecting late_initcall_sync() level
clean up code in device drivers in the future and start asking them to
move to sync_state(). If this feature isn't turned on, the behavior
will default to a late_initcall_sync() level execution. But when this
is on, it'll actually work nicely with modules. So that's another way
to drive folks to it and improve things over time.

Maybe we can have this on by default in linux-next and -rc. Fix any
issues that show up and can be fixed without breaking the goal of this
series (make things work with modules). And finally turn it off by
default before it gets pulled into mainline? That way, we get the
maximum test coverage we can get, but not accidentally break anything
that wasn't tested?

Thanks,
Saravana
