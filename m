Is it really going to be easier to debug a guest that sees behavior
which may not be architecturally correct?  For example, seeing a data
abort on an access to an MMIO region because the guest used a strange
instruction?

I appreaciate that the current way we handle this is confusing and has
led many people down a rabbit hole, so we should do better.

Would a better approach not be to return to userspace saying, "we can't
handle this in the kernel, you decide", without printing the dubious
kernel error message.  Then user space could suspend the VM and print a
lenghty explanation of all the possible problems there could be, or
re-inject something back into the guest, or whatever, for a particular
environment.

Thoughts?
