Either the stopper preempted another being in a critical section and
has something wrong itself in case of PREEMPT or mechanisms for
urgent control doesn't work correctly.

I don't know what exactly you intended but I would check things like
(1) irq disable / eqs / tick / scheduler events and (2) whether special
handling for each level of qs urgency has started correctly. For that
purpose all the history of those events would be more useful.

And with thinking it more, we could come up with a good way to
make use of those data to identify what the problem is. Do I catch
the point correctly? If so, me and Joel can start to work on it.
Otherwise, please correct me.
