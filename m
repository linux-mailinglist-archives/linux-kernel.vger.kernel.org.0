No. IRQs that are disabled but have wake enabled on them should not wake
up the CPU from deep idle states (which is what I assume you mean by
idle path LPM (Low Power Mode)). Only if the irq is enabled should it
wake the CPU from deep idle states, and in this case irq wake state has
nothing to do with that working or not.

That looks like a bug. It appears that gpiolib is only hooking the irq
disable path here so that it can keep track of what irqs are not in use
by gpiolib and allow them to be used for GPIO purposes when the irqs are
disabled. See commit 461c1a7d4733 ("gpiolib: override
irq_enable/disable"). That code in gpiolib should probably see if lazy
mode has been disabled on the irq and do similar things to what genirq
does and then let genirq mask the gpios if they trigger during the time
when the irq is disabled. Regardless of this design though, I don't
understand why this matters.

__disable_irq() considers lazy setting or not and leaves the irq
unmasked if the irq is lazy disabled. But we have the
IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND flag set in the gpio irq controller and that
properly masks the irq through the hierarchy if necessary. Again, this
is fine and all but I don't see how it matters.

I don't see any need to change genirq by changing how
suspend_device_irq() is written, but I'm not the maintainer of this code.

It sounds like PDC just passes along the level or edge and relies on the
parent irq chip (GIC in this case) to have the irq unmasked so it can be
seen at the CPU. If the irq is masked at the GIC does it still wakeup
the CPU if it's unmasked at the PDC?

Does the PDC have any other registers that can latch an edge type irq
across suspend so we can read it on resume? If that exists then we can
have software resend irqs at resume time. I think this was asked before
and the answer was it doesn't exist.

If there isn't any sort of latching, then why can't we unmask the irq in
the GIC hardware by calling irq_chip_enable_parent() from the suspend
hook in PDC? That should guarantee that the irq is unmasked at the GIC
when we're suspending and the GIC is about to lose power. And presumably
the GIC state is restored by hardware on resume so that the PDC can
forward the edge to the GIC which can interrupt the CPU because the
interrupt was left unmasked. The idea is to capture wake and enable
state in a bitmap, unmask at the PDC and GIC during system suspend if
it's marked for wakeup regardless of enable state, and then mask in the
PDC and GIC during resume if the irq is disabled in software. Does that
fail somehow?
