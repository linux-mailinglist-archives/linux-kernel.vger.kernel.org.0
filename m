On the otherhand, what about trying to make command mode panels
resemble video mode panels slightly?  Video mode panels have a vsync
counter in hardware, which is missing from command mode - however it
seems like the driver/drm framework would prefer such a counter.
Would it be a reasonable idea to make a software counter, and just
increment it every time the pp_done irq is triggered?

I'm just thinking that we'll avoid issues long term by trying to make
the code common, rather than diverging it for the two modes.
