A 'struct driver' is not Intel-specific, sorry.

First off, the ask to move away from platform devices came from Greg. 
Not me. All I did here was suggest solutions, one reviewed by Greg as 
'sane' and 'nice work'. Greg essentially wrote the book on 
devices/drivers so his review means I am not completely senile just yet.

You pushed back with two proposals that don't account for power 
management and the driver name required for ASoC. That was on top on 
another suggestion to use platform devices that was shot down by Greg 
himself with language I can't quote here.

Please re-read my words: my ask was "Pick one or suggest something that 
is implementable."

You don't pick one and don't suggest anything implementable either, so 
there's really not much I can do, can I? I don't have a solution without 
a 'struct driver', and you don't want it.

The only short-term path forward I see is to ask Greg to agree to keep 
the platform devices for now.

How is a 'struct driver' platform specific?

> exact same controller(s) but only as standalone one...

That would really not change anything. There would be some sort of ID 
(PCI or something else) for the controller and multiple masters below. 
The ACPI/DisCo spec does not account for masters so they would have to 
be created by hand.

Again how is a 'struct driver' an 'intrusive change'?
