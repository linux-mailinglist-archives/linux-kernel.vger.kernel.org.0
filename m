Sorry, but I don't follow you here. If PSTATE.SS is not cleared, why would
you take the step exception?

No, I think you might be conflating PSTATE.SS and MDSCR_EL1.SS.

I don't see how this can happen for kprobes. Have you managed to reproduce
the failure?

I don't think there's a hardware bug.

It sound like you're trying to make kernel debugging per-task instead
of per-cpu, but I don't think that's the right thing to do. What if I /want/
to debug an interrupt handler? For example, I might have a watchpoint on
something accessed by timer interrupt.

This sounds like you've broken debug; we should take the step exception
in the exception handler. That's the way this is supposed to work.

Honestly, I get the feeling that you don't really understand the code
you're changing here and it's a tonne of effort to try to untangle what
you're doing. That's not necessarily your fault because the debug
architecture is a nightmare to comprehend, but I'm not keen to change it
unless we have a really good justification. I'm sure kgdb is riddled with
bugs but, as I said before, the fixes should be in kgdb, not by tearing
up the low-level debug code (which has the potential to break other users).

Maybe it would be easier if you tried to fix one problem per patch,
preferably with a way to reproduce the issue you're seeing each time?
