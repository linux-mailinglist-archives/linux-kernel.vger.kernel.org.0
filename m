What flag?  -mabi=elfv[12]?

(Only irrelevant things are ever ignored; otherwise, please do a bug
report).

You can have elfv2 on BE, and e.g. the sysv ABI on LE.  Neither of those
is tested a lot.

Yup.

That depends on what you call "an ABI", I guess.  You can call any ABI
variant a separate ABI: you'll have to rebuild all of userland.  You can
also says ELFv1 and ELFv2 are pretty much the same thing, which is true
as well.  The way -mabi= is defined is the latter:

'-mabi=ABI-TYPE'
     Extend the current ABI with a particular extension, or remove such
     extension.  Valid values are 'altivec', 'no-altivec',
     'ibmlongdouble', 'ieeelongdouble', 'elfv1', 'elfv2'.
