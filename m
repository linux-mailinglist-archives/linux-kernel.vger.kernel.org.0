Even if we don't add new transport right away, I would like to see if
the requirements are met. I will take a look at you v2 with that in mind
anyways. We need not wait, we I want to see people think it meets their
requirement. I will also add couple of guys working on virtio transport
for SCMI when I respond to your v2. Thanks for posting it.

Peng, Did you get a chance to try this with SMC ? If SCMI was the only
usecase, you can try this approach instead of mailbox, now that no one
has any objects to this approach conceptually. Please use v2 as base
and update us.
