Al,
I am aware of these and have a 23 part patchset on the linux-scsi list
for review (see https://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=157052102631490&w=2 )
that amongst other things fixes all of these. It also re-adds the
functionality removed from the bsg driver last year. Unfortunately that
review process is going very slowly, so I have no objections if you
apply these now.

It is unlikely that these changes will introduce any bugs (they didn't in
my testing). If you want to do more testing you may find the sg3_utils
package helpful, especially in the testing directory:
     https://github.com/hreinecke/sg3_utils
