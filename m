Yes you are right, I must say that this is somewhat surprising
most Cherry Trail devices do use 64 bit firmware (where as Bay Trail
typically uses 32 bit). But I just checked efibootmgr output and it
says it is booting: \EFI\FEDORA\SHIMIA32.EFI so yeah 32 bit firmware.

Recent Fedora releases take care of this so seamlessly I did not
even realize...

Regards,

Hans
