A few points worth mentioning here:

1) As I stated earlier, using mm_cpumask in its current form is not
   an option for membarrier. For two reasons:

   A) The mask is not populated on all architectures (e.g. arm64 does
      not populate it),

   B) Even if it was populated on all architectures, we would need to
      carefully audit and document every spot where this mm_cpumask
      is set or cleared within each architecture code, and ensure we
      have the required memory barriers between user-space memory
      accesses and those stores, documenting those requirements into
      each architecture code in the process. This seems to be a lot of
      useless error-prone code churn.

2) I should actually use GFP_KERNEL rather than GFP_NOWAIT in this
   membarrier registration code. But it can still fail. However, the other
   membarrier code using the same fallback pattern (private and global
   expedited) documents that those membarrier commands do not block in
   the membarrier(2) man page, so GFP_NOWAIT is appropriate in those cases.

3) Testing-wise, I fully agree with your argument of lacking test coverage.
   One option I'm considering would be to add a selftest based on the
   fault-injection infrastructure, which would ensure that we have coverage
   of the failure case in the kernel selftests.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
