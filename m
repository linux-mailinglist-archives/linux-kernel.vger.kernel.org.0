+Matthew for a lockdown question
We are considering [ab]using lockdown (you knew this will happen!) for
fuzzing kernel. LOCKDOWN_DEBUGFS is a no-go for us and we may want a
few other things that may be fuzzing-specific.
The current inflexibility comes from the global ordering of levels:

if (kernel_locked_down >= level)
if (kernel_locked_down >= what) {

Is it done for performance? Or for simplicity?
If it would be more like an arbitrary bitset, then we could pick and
choose what we need and add few options on the side (not part of
integrity/confidentiality).
I see several potential ways to do it:
1. Rework the current code to allow arbitrary sets of options enabled.
2. Leave the current global ordering and checks intact and add a
separate mode that will do bitmask-like checks (e.g. under
CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_FUZZER).
3. Or hardcode the fuzzer list statically based on config (but then we
can leave the rest of the code intact), e.g.:

#if !CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_FUZZER
    [LOCKDOWN_DEBUGFS] = "debugfs access",
#endif
#if CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_FUZZER
    [LOCKDOWN_FIFREEZE] = "FIFREEZE ioctl",
#endif

Thoughts?
