But how can you tell if the first one is the "malicious" one and the
second one is "legitimate"?  You do that by the "normal" file
permissions and the like, you don't try to do a "first one wins!" type
of policy, that's crazy :)

If you are trying to keep someone from having multiple FD per device,
then yes, you should care.  The point is, you can't know.

Don't rely on "first one wins!" as a security policy to prevent bad
things from happening.  That's never going to work, let userspace police
these things, as that is the only place you can do it properly (or with
a selinux/apparmor/lsm policy).

If you run across it again, please let me know.  It's a common
"anti-pattern" that I have been guilty of in the past.
