Thanks, that makes sense.  Interesting about USB.

Perfect, thank you for that.  I've tried the following controllers that I 
have access to.  One worked (hspa/HP Gen8 Smart Array Controller), but the 
others I tried are not providing VPDs:

* LSI 2108 (Supermicro)
* LSI 3108 (Dell)
* Areca 1882
* Areca 1883
* Fibrechannel 8gbe connected to a Storwize 3700

~]# sg_vpd -p bl /dev/sdb
VPD page=0xb0
fetching VPD page failed

Neat, thanks for the hint!
