Do you really want a few thousand (or even tens) i915-client-%d? That
does not particularly seem like it adds ease-of-use, and would need to be
restricted to the client [or root]. The intent is for the client to have
a private channel for detailed debug/error reporting of its own calls
into the kernel.
