If I apply patch 3 won't it break boot until patch 2 is also in the
tree? That seems to imply that I'll break bisection, and we have
kernelci boot testing clk-next so this will probably set off alarms
somewhere.

I thought we had some code that got removed that was going to make the
transition "seamless" in the sense that it would search the tree for an
RPM clk controller and then not add the XO fixed factor clk somehow.
See commit 54823af9cd52 ("clk: qcom: Always add factor clock for xo
clocks") for the code that we removed. So ideally we do something like
this too, but now we search for a property on the calling node to see if
the XO clk is there?
