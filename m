I don't think they're strictly dummy. Even for boot time available devices
iirc there's no strict requirement for there to be respective data in MCFG.
Such a requirement exists only for devices which are actually needed to
start the OS (disk or network, perhaps video or alike), or maybe even just
its loader.
