Yes, not performance critical but it can cause isolation issues.

Yes, we should be fixing the implementations of all shrinkers and yes
it is bigger issue but we can also fix register/unregister isolation
issue in parallel. Fixing all shrinkers would a tedious and long task
and we should not block fixing isolation issue on it.

I agree with your scalability concern (though others would argue to
first demonstrate the issue before adding more sophisticated scalable
code). Most memory reclaim code is written without the performance or
scalability concern, maybe we should switch our thinking.
