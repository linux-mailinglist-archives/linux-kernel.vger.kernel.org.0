mt25qu512a is rebranded after its spinoff from STM, so it is
different only in term of operating frequency, initial JEDEC id
is same as that of n25q512a. In order to avoid any confussion
with respect to name new entry is added.
This flash is tested for Single I/O and QUAD I/O mode on LS1046FRWY.

mt35xu02g is Octal flash supporting Single I/O and QCTAL I/O
and it has been tested on LS1028ARDB
