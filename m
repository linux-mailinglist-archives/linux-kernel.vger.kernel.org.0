It seems we have an agreement here: the best is indeed to have two
files, one with the Documentation/ABI parser, and another one with the=20
Sphinx extension...

... and here is where we have two different views.

=46rom debug PoV, the Documentation/ABI parser script should be able to
print the results by a command line call. This is also a feature
that it is useful for the users: to be able to seek for a symbol
and output its ABI description. So, the "stdout" output will be
there anyway.

The only extra data for the extension side is the file name where
the information came and the line number.

=46rom maintainership PoV, adding the sideband API for file+line is
one line at the parser script (a print) and two lines at the Sphinx
extension (a regex expression and a match line). That's simple to
maintain.

It is also simple to verify both sides independently, as what
you see when running the parser script is what you get at the
extension.

If we add a new ABI between the parser script and the extension
script, this would require to also maintain the ABI, and would
make harder to identify problems on ABI problems.

-

Another advantage of having those independent is that the
language of the parsing script can be different. Not being
python is a big advantage for me, as perl is a lot more
intuitive and easier to write parser scripts for my eyes.

I can write a perl parsing script in a matter of minutes.
It takes me a lot more time to do the same with python, and then
ensure that it will work with two similar but different languages
(python2 and python3) [1].

[1] btw, with that regards, I still don't know how to teach a
    python script that it should "prefer" to run with python3 but would
    fall back to python2. Adding this shebang:
	# /usr/bin/env python
    just do the opposite - at least on Fedora


Thanks,
Mauro
