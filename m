Right, sugov and load balance happen to use the same margin (1.25)
to check if a given util fits in a given capacity, though the thresholds
are hardcoded in different places (see map_util_freq() and
capacity_margin). So my suggestion was to unify the capacity_margin code
for frequency selection and CPU selection, for clarity and consistency.

But again, this is a small thing and FWIW Viresh's patch LGTM as-is so
no objection from my end if you guys would like to merge it.

Thanks,
Quentin
