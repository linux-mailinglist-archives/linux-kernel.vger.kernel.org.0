Sure thing, the patch adds in a call which checks if range of registers
is writeable within _regmap_raw_write_impl. This check uses the length
of the data given to _regmap_raw_write_impl to determine the range
of registers to check from the given starting register.

I see yes, we don't want to stumble into a noinc register by mistake when
writing a register range.

You mentioned that we likely have breakage elsewhere, I believe that
regmap_noinc_write probably shouldn't ever have been calling
_regmap_raw_write.

Whilst regmap_noinc_read calls _regmap_raw_read, this function doesn't
do any massage and just calls map->bus->read after selecting a page.
regmap_raw_write on the other hand is meant for writing blocks to
register ranges as these added checks show, and does split work based
on page length etc.
This splitting up is something that shouldn't apply to the FIFO as it's a
deep register.

I modified regmap_noinc_write to be much more like the raw_read
internals, just select page then attempt a map->bus->gather_write,
falling back to linearising if that's not supported.
This approach worked at getting writing working into the FIFO.

So I would propose that there are two 'Fixes:' patches here, one
enhancing the checking when writing a register range to ensure you
don't stumble into a noinc register.
And one to fix noinc_writes to send data directly to the bus once the
page is selected with no splitting up as you would a range.

Kind regards,
Ben
