Yes the pin of the soc is shared between those functions, so you'll
have to check the schematics of your board where this pin is going
to.

If you check the schematics [0] page 11, GPIO4_C7's signal is named HDMI_CEC
and on page 18 you can see that it goes as expected to the cec-pin of the
hdmi connector. 

So the Nanopc-T4 should only select the cec signal.
