I don't think I've ever seen Power do this, but I've not checked the git
history.

Right:

WRITE_ONCE() is something like:

  *(volatile typeof(var)*)(&(var)) = val;

And should translate to just a regular store; the volatile just tells
the C compiler it should not do funny things with it.

READ_ONCE() is something like:

  val = *(volatile typeof(var)*)(&(var));

And should translate to just a regular load; the volatile again tells
the compiler to not be funny about it.

No memory barriers what so ever, not even a compiler barrier as such.

The thing is, your bog standard LL/SC _SHOULD_ fail the SC if someone
else does a regular store to the same variable. See the example in
Documentation/atomic_t.txt.

That is, a competing SW/SWI should result in the interconnect responding
with something other than EXOKAY, the SWX should fail and MSR[C] <- 1.

Will, Paul; can't this LKMM thing generate kernel modules to run? And do
we have a 'nice' collection of litmus tests that cover atomic_t ?

The one in atomic_t.txt should cover this one at least.
