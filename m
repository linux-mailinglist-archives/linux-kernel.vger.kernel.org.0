git rebase --onto next/master <your base> is your best bet,
though it depends how long you've left it how easy that's going
to be.

You shuould see announcements of the individual regulators on the
device from the regulator subsystem.

In this case it'll say something about "vpa" if it registers this
one (but if there's a parent that's having trouble then this
won't register).

No, a parent regulator - something providing a power supply to
vpa.  Though I can't see anything in the kernel code that'd set
one up and there's nothing in the DT...

You should generally get an error message if it's the regulator
subsystem.

That's a user of the regulator so it's probably just a symptom of
the regulator not loading.

> another strange line is this:

This could well be it, if the MFD the device is on fails to load
the regulator won't either since it will only load after the MFD
does.  The MFD driver ensures that the drivers for all the
functions on the chip share the chip effectively.

That sounds like the issue then.

Sure, thanks for trying.
