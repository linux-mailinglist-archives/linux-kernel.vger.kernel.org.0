What kind of pages?
I mean, I guess it could be done, it was just not implemented, and I
did not want to add more "features" as my main goal was to re-work
the interface to be more deterministic.

Yes, but the problem comes when trying to work with a hwpoison high-order page
in free_pages_prepare, it gets more complicated, and when I weigthed
code vs benefits, I was not really sure to go down that road.

If we get a hwpoison high-order page in free_pages_prepare, we need to
break it down to smaller pages, so we can skip the "bad" to not be sent
into buddy allocator.

Well, it is not really free, as it is not usable, is it?
Anyway, I do agree that we should clean the bondings to other subsystems like memcg.
