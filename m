Trying to zero the extent block is only going to provide pretend
security; the data blocks are still there, and anyone looking for the
data can still find it if they look hard enough.  Also, for most
files, it really doesn't matter.

So, no, I don't think this patch is appropriate.a

If you are really worried about the security for deleted files, I
would suggest trying to implement the secure delete flag (chattr +s)
for ext4, and actually trying to zero out the data blocks for those
files where this kind of security is required.  (Please note that for
SSD's, this probably won't provide as much security as you would like
unless they implement the secure discard operation.)
