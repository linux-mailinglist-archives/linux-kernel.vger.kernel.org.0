How the $%$# did I mess that up?  I know choosing recipients for
this series was mostly manual, becase it didn't fit the usual
pattern of the entire series going to everyone affectrd by any part
of it.

And then there waqs a whole lot of shuffling things into a logical
order and grouping.

But I checked MAINTAINERS originally, I really did.  :-(

I agree.  Sorry, that comment in the commit message was a bit of
a "not to self" that I didn't clean up.  Feel free to rm it when
queueing if you like.

Thank you, I'll put it in my "accepted" pile.
