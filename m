Examples are good, but what makes it so that there are no examples of
its being unsafe?

And a few questions along the way, some quick quiz, some more serious.
Would it be safe if it checked in_interrupt() instead of in_irq()?
If not, should the in_interrupt() in the "if" condition preceding the
added "else if" be changed to in_irq()?  Would it make sense to add an
"|| !irqs_were_disabled" do your new "else if" condition?  Would the
body of the "else if" actually be executed in current mainline?

In an attempt to be at least a little constructive, I am doing some
testing of this patch overnight, along with a WARN_ON_ONCE() to see if
that invoke_rcu_core() is ever reached.

							Thanx, Paul
