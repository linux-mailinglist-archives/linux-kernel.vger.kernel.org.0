Perhaps, but sounds like it will abuse and uglify transhuge_vma_suitable()
just for smaps. Would passing transhuge_vma_suitable() the address
    ((vma->vm_end & HPAGE_PMD_MASK) - HPAGE_PMD_SIZE)
give the the correct answer in all cases?

Please read again what I explained there: it's not necessarily an example
of wrong smaps output, it's reasonable smaps output for a reasonable case.

Yes, maybe Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt should explain "THPeligble"
a little better - "eligible for allocating THP pages" rather than just
"eligible for THP pages" would be good enough? we don't want to write
a book about the various cases.

Oh, and the "THPeligible" output lines up very nicely there in proc.txt:
could the actual alignment of that 0 or 1 be fixed in smaps itself too?

Thanks,
Hugh
