That's being fixed by your patch 2/2 though, right?

That's correct, but in test_aead_vs_generic_impl() the generic implementation is
used to generate the test vectors.

I just want to avoid adding complexity that isn't worthwhile.
Beyond your patch 2, how about we just do:

diff --git a/crypto/testmgr.c b/crypto/testmgr.c
index 79b431545249a9..2ab48d4d317250 100644
--- a/crypto/testmgr.c
+++ b/crypto/testmgr.c
@@ -2564,11 +2564,11 @@ static int test_aead_extra(const char *driver,
 		goto out;
 	}
 
-	err = test_aead_inauthentic_inputs(ctx);
+	err = test_aead_vs_generic_impl(ctx);
 	if (err)
 		goto out;
 
-	err = test_aead_vs_generic_impl(ctx);
+	err = test_aead_inauthentic_inputs(ctx);
 out:
 	kfree(ctx->vec.key);
 	kfree(ctx->vec.iv);


Then the dedicated tests for inauthentic inputs wouldn't be run until the fuzz
tests vs. generic have already passed.
