Either way is fine by me. But explain why in comment if you decide
to keep current code.  Something like
	 /* Strip line number cause it's not very helpful. */

It's not broken, it doesn't exist.

I think it's fine to add it in this patch because BUILD_BUG_ON() is just a hint for developers
that this particular function depends on growing down stack. So it's more a property of the function
rather than KASAN in general.

Other functions you mentioned can be marked with BUILD_BUG_ON()s as well, but not in this patch indeed.
