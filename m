What is the 'unless crashkernel=...,high' for? I think it would be simpler to relax the
ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT if reserve_crashkernel_low() allocated something.

This way "crashkernel=1G" tries to allocate 1G below 4G, but fails if there isn't enough
memory. "crashkernel=1G crashkernel=16M,low" allocates 16M below 4G, which is more likely
to succeed, if it does it can then place the 1G block anywhere.

With both crashk_low_res and crashk_res, we end up with two entries in /proc/iomem called
"Crash kernel". Because its sorted by address, and kexec-tools stops searching when it
find "Crash kernel", you are always going to get the kernel placed in the lower portion.

I suspect this isn't what you want, can we rename crashk_low_res for arm64 so that
existing kexec-tools doesn't use it?

This is going to be annoying on platforms that don't have, and don't need memory below 4G.
A "crashkernel=...,low" on these system will break crashdump. I don't think we should
expect users to know the memory layout. (I'm assuming distro's are going to add a low
reservation everywhere, just in case)

I think the 'low' region should be a small optional/best-effort extra, that kexec-tools
can't touch.


I'm afraid you've missed the ugly bit of the crashkernel reservation...

arch/arm64/mm/mmu.c::map_mem() marks the crashkernel as 'nomap' during the first pass of
page-table generation. This means it isn't mapped in the linear map. It then maps it with
page-size mappings, and removes the nomap flag.

This is done so that arch_kexec_protect_crashkres() and
arch_kexec_unprotect_crashkres() can remove the valid bits of the crashkernel mapping.
This way the old-kernel can't accidentally overwrite the crashkernel. It also saves us if
the old-kernel and the crashkernel use different memory attributes for the mapping.

As your low-memory reservation is intended to be used for devices, having it mapped by the
old-kernel as cacheable memory is going to cause problems if those CPUs aren't taken
offline and go corrupting this memory. (we did crash for a reason after all)


I think the simplest thing to do is mark the low region as 'nomap' in
reserve_crashkernel() and always leave it unmapped. We can then describe it via a
different string in /proc/iomem, something like "Crash kernel (low)". Older kexec-tools
shouldn't use it, (I assume its not using strncmp() in a way that would do this by
accident), and newer kexec-tools can know to describe it in the DT, but it can't write to it.


Thanks,

James
