Thanks, I do seem to have trouble spelling it correctly :)

Good point.

Tempting...

This actually sounds the neatest, but I'm not sure whether there's going
to be any conflicts between VHE/NVHE. I'll prototype this and see how
ugly it is.

Well Mark Rutland disliked my initial thoughts about just including both
errata in one option like that - hence the refactoring in this patch.
Although of course that's exactly what's happened with 1319367/1319537...

> What do you think?

I'll have a go at SPECULATIVE_AT covering both VHE/NVHE - from an
initial look it seems like it should work and it would be neat if it
does. In particular it should avoid the necessity to require VHE when
the erratum is present.

Otherwise I guess SPECULATIVE_AT_{,N}VHE is probably second best.

Thanks,

Steve
