We can identify short reads, but we won't get information about
readahead back from generic_file_read_iter or filemap_fault. We could
try to work around this with filesystem specific flags for ->readpage
and ->readpages, but that would break down with multiple concurrent
readers in addition to being a real mess. I'm currently out of better
ideas that avoid duplicating the generic code.
