Even if the write *has* reached the device, there can be a delay before
the device de-sassert the interrupt line, and there can be a subsequent
delay for each irqchip between the device and the CPU re-sampling the
line and propagating this to its output.

Thus it's always possible to take a spurious IRQ after an IRQ handler
returns, even if the device de-asserted its interrupt line immediately.

Linux drivers are expected to be resilient to spurious IRQs.

This really depends on what you're doing. In many cases it's fine for
the write to complete later, given cases like the above.

IIUC, memory barriers cannot necessarily ensure that a write has reached
a device.

A read ensures that the device has accepted the prior write, but does
not necessarily guarantee that it has changed internal state or
triggered any externally visible effects.

What exactly you need to do will depend on what you're trying to achieve
and the behaviour of the specific device.

Thanks,
Mark.
