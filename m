Ok, thank you for looking into this.

They are actually what I expected :)

The first USB interface is a mouse boot class device, since this is a mouse
only receiver. This means that the mouse report is unnumbered and we need to
extend the unnumbered mouse-report handling to handle this case. Also the
device is using the same highres mouse-reports as the gaming receiver is.

I'm actually preparing a patch right now which should fix this. Still might
be better to do the revert for 5.2 and get proper support for the c52f
receiver into 5.3.

Regards,

Hans
