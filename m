Looking again, I think I'd misunderstood how
ARM64_CPUCAP_OPTIONAL_FOR_LATE_CPU was dealt with, but we do have a
problem in this area.

I had a quick chat with Will, and we concluded that we must permit late
onlining of heterogeneous CPUs here as people are likely to rely on
late CPU onlining on some heterogeneous systems.

I think the above permits that, but that also means that we need some
support code to fail gracefully in that case (e.g. without sending
a SIGILL to unaware userspace code).

That means that we'll need the counter emulation code that you had in
previous versions of this patch (e.g. to handle potential UNDEFs when a
new CPU has fewer counters than the previously online CPUs).

Further, I think the context switch (and event index) code needs to take
this cap into account, and disable direct access once the system becomes
heterogeneous.

Thanks,
Mark.
