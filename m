Just to be more precise here and also to better understand, here I'm
talking about turning the tweaks we already have for:

 - START_DEBIT
 - GENTLE_FAIR_SLEEPERS

a bit more parametric and proportional to the latency-nice of a task.

In principle, if a task declares a positive latency niceness, could we
not read this also as "I accept to be a bit penalised in terms of
fairness at wakeup time"?

Whatever tweaks we do there should affect anyway only one sched_latency
period... although I'm not yet sure if that's possible and how.

Preempting before is definitively a nice-to-have feature.

At the same time it's interesting a support where a low latency-nice
task (e.g. TOP_APP) RUNNABLE on a CPU has better chances to be executed
up to completion without being preempted by an high latency-nice task
(e.g. BACKGROUND) waking up on its CPU.

For that to happen, we need a mechanism to "delay" the execution of a
less important RUNNABLE task up to a certain period.

It's impacting the fairness, true, but latency-nice in this case will
means that we want to "complete faster", not just "start faster".

Is this definition something we can reason about?

Best,
Patrick
