Thanks! Good and bad news here, then.

I now understand what is going on - and there is certainly room for
improvements here, but more importantly the actual mmci busy detection
works as expected.

When it comes to improvements, the main issue I have found is how we
treat DATA WRITES. In many cases we simply don't use the HW busy
detection at all, but instead rely on the mmc core to send CMD13 in a
loop to poll. Well, then if the polling would have consisted of a
couple of CMD13s that wouldn't be an issue, but my observations is
rather that the numbers of CMD13 sent to poll is in the range or
hundreds/thousands - per each WRITE request!

I am going to send a patch (or two) that improves the behavior. It
might even involve changing parts in core layer, not sure how the end
result will look like yet.

In any case, I have applied patch 1 and patch2 for next, as the tests
turned out well at my side. I also took the liberty of updating some
of the comments/changelogs, please have look and tell if there is
something you want to change.

I will continue with the rest of series next week.

Kind regards
Uffe
