I learned to be aware of the decisions that I make when finding a bug somewhere
instead of following the initial problem that I see I ask myself "is
there any proof that this initial problem is the actual root cause".
I can then make the decision to do some experiments to rule out a
problem - until I come to a point where I ask myself again "am I still
going in the right direction - how does this bring me to the root
cause of the problem"
unfortunately that's harder than it seems - but it keeps me from
spending time going in the wrong direction

nice, congrats for finding this!

interesting, the clock driver for the 32-bit SoCs
(driver/clk/meson/meson8b.c) sets CLK_IS_CRITICAL for meson8b_cpu_clk.
you have something similar in your patch for the G12A/B CPU clocks
I guess that also explains why changing CONFIG_PWM_MESON from =m to =y
"fixes" it:
- as long as the PWM driver is not loaded the VDDCPU regulator does
not probe either
- this goes on for the initial boot process
- now the PWM driver is still not loaded and the common clock
framework tries to disable the unused clocks
- it disables the CPU clock and the system now stops working
- (only later it would load the PWM driver and allow the cpufreq
subsystem to come up)

with CONFIG_PWM_MESON=y you get:
- PWM driver is built-in so the VDDCPU regulator shows up
- the cpufreq subsystem comes up and enables the clock (in reality it
only increments the refcount because the clock is already enabled)
- the common clock framework tries to disable the unused clocks - it
doesn't disable the CPU clock this time because it's used (according
to the ref count/enable count)
- ...
