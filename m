You don't really need to know too much about efifb.. the story would
be the same with simplefb, the only difference is that the scanout
address/size/format come from EFI GOP instead of dt.

The main thing is we really want to avoid a runpm resume/suspend cycle
until the we have all the components of the display, including
bridge/panel.  If the display is enabled by bootloader, then the
initial resume will be no-op (turning on clks and power domains that
are already on), but the following suspend will actually turn things
off.  If this happens because, for example, the bridge driver didn't
get copied to initrd, or probe-deferred because it is missing one of
it's dependencies, the result will be a black screen with no way to
debug what went wrong.

I guess if we can rely on panel/bridge being probed indirectly from
mipi_dsi_host_register() (but before it returns, so dsi host can defer
if bridge/panel is missing) maybe that works out..
