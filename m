Thomas, Rafael,
I have added a timeout counter in __synchronize_hardirq().
At the bottom I have converted while(inprogress); to while(inprogress
&& timeout++ < 100);

That is bypassing the suspend lockup problem. On both 32-bit and
64-bit VMs the countdown is triggered by sync of irq9.
Which probably means that there is some issue in ACPI handler and
synchronize_hardirq() is stuck on it?
I will try to repeat with 5.3-rc4 tomorrow....

Thanks, Woody
