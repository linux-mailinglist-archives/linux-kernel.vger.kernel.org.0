Oh wrt disabling fbdev: Make sure CONFIG_FB isn't set. Unfortunately a
pile of other things select that, for convenience (like
CONFIG_DRM_KMS_FB_HELPER).

That should get rid of all the problematic fbdev code.

From what I've seen in some of the syzbot mails flying by we also have
issues in vt and console code blowing up (not just on fbcon/fbdev, but
also e.g. on vgacon). That stuff you'll still hit. But maybe you can
trick Greg KH into fixing the vt/console.c issues, he just claimed
that :-P
