I see the issue you want to address.

But isn't then the comment in the patch "... a thread in a cgroup wants
to yield CPU to another thread within the same cgroup ..." misleading?

IMHO, a task can't yield to another task. It can only relinquish the CPU.

Someone could argue that in the current implementation, the task which
calls yield acts on behalf of all the tasks in its taskgroup hierarchy.
But this can have issues as you pointed out.
