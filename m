Help me understand the problem that you are trying to solve here. Is
this a case of you having two clients on Linux-side needing to use the
same lock but still requiring the arbitration with software running on
some other remote processor? Are they talking to the same entity on the
remote-side or different peers.

I see the series is all about getting a handle so that they can use the
API, and is the expected usage that the same entity will lock and unlock
before the other driver can lock it.

Wouldn't it be actually simpler to just introduce a new specific API
variant for this, similar to the reset core for example (it uses a
separate exclusive API), without having to modify the bindings at all.
It is just a case of your driver using the right API, and the core can
be modified to use the additional tag semantics based on the API. It
should avoid any confusion with say using a different second cell value
for the same lock in two different nodes.

If you are sharing a hwlock on the Linux side, surely your driver should
be aware that it is a shared lock. The tag can be set during the first
request API, and you look through both tags when giving out a handle.

Obviously, the hwspin_lock_request() API usage semantics always had the
implied additional need for communicating the lock id to the other peer
entity, so a realistic usage is most always the specific API variant. I
doubt this API would be of much use for the shared driver usage. This
also implies that the client user does not care about specifying a lock
in DT.
