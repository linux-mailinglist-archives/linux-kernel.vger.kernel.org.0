The capabilities here mean things like is the port: source, sink or
DRP; host, device or DRD; etc. So static information.

I do understand that the EC is in control of the Port Controller (or
PD controller), the muxes, the policy decisions and what have you, and
that is fine. My point is that the operating system should not have to
get also the hardware description from the EC. That part should always
come from ACPI tables or DT, even when the components are attached to
the EC instead of the host CPU. Otherwise we loose scalability for no
good reason.

Note. The device properties for the port capabilities are already
documented in kernel:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/connector/usb-connector.txt (the
same properties work in ACPI as well).

This implementation should already be made so that it works with a
properly prepared ACPI tables or DT. If there are already boards that
don't supply the nodes in ACPI tables for the ports, then software
nodes can be used with those, but all new boards really should have a
real firmware node represeting every Type-C port.

thanks,
