You could retain compatibility with old devicetrees (which may be
useful) by using the "phys" property if it exists and falling back
on the old method if it doesn't.  Then you would get this sequence
of changes:

1. Update binding definition.
2. Support new binding in driver, with fallback to old.
3. Switch dts files to new binding.
