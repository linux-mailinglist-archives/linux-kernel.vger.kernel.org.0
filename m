Yes, but -mstackrealign looks like it's supported by clang as well.

Right, this is a no-go, esp to just fix old compilers.

What I suggested was in reference to your proposal for dropping the
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=4 for modern compilers, but keeping it for
<7.1. -mstackrealign would at least let 5.3 onwards be less likely to
break (and it doesn't error before then, I think it just doesn't
actually do anything, so no worse than now at least).

Simply dropping support for <7.1 would be cleanest, yes, but it sounds
like people don't want to go that far.
