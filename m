kprobes probing kprobes!? ... why do we support this?

We treat 'debug' as our highest exception level, it can interrupt pNMI and RAS-errors.
Letting it loop doesn't sound like a good idea.

How does this happen?
I guess the kprobe-helper-function gets called in debug context, but surely you can't
kprobe a kprobe-helper-function? What stops this going in a loop?


> it modifies debug exception clear (pstate.D = 0).

After taking the first BRK, DAIF=0xf, everything is masked. When you take the second BRK
this shouldn't change.

Those spsr_set_debug_flag() calls are modifying the spsr in the regs structure, they only
become PSTATE when we eret for single-step.

PSTATE.D bit clearing should only be effective for the duration of the single-step.

(This sounds like undoing something that shouldn't have happened in the first place)

(Nit: this is the only caller of spsr_set_debug_flag(), as we're modifing regs->pstate
directly here, can we lose the helper and just manipulate regs->pstate? )

These two hunks look like cleanup, could we do this separately from a fix for stable?

Ugh. .. I get it ..

I think the simplest summary of the problem is:
Kprobes unmasks debug exceptions for single-step, then leaves them unmasked when the
probed function is restarted.

I'd like to know more about this nested case, but I don't think its the simplest example
of this problem.
The commit message is describing both the interrupted and running PSTATE as PSTATE. I
think it would be clearer if you called the interrupted one SPSR (saved pstate register).
That's the value in the regs structure.


Please don't re-manipulate the flags, its overly verbose and we've already got this wrong
once! We should just blindly restore the DAIF setting we had before as its simpler.

Could we change kprobes_save_local_irqflag() to save the DAIF bits of pstate:
| kcb->saved_irqflag = regs->pstate & DAIF_MASK;
(DAIF_MASK is all four PSR bits)

So that we can then fix this in kprobes_restore_local_irqflag() with:
| regs->pstate &= ~DAIF_MASK;
| regs->pstate |= kcb->saved_irqflag

(the value splicing is needed because regs->pstate also holds the 'condition code' flags,
which could be modified by the single-step instruction, then depended on afterwards.)


Thanks,

James
