I understand these aren't busses. But most devices from ACPI and DT
get put on acpi bus or platform bus? So I was trying to just handle
platform bus since that's the majority of the use cases I run into as
part of Android. Anyway, see comments further below. I think we are
lining up now.

See my reply further below. That should address some of the concerns
as "buses" won't be a concern anymore. Having said that, the main
point I was making here is that I can't design for a hypothetical case
that has no example with a proper definition of what's the expected
behavior.

Ah, I didn't realize you were asking me to add to the fwnode ops. I
thought you wanted me to handle this at the driver core level by
moving of_link_to_suppliers to driver core and replacing of_* APIs
with fwnode ops. And that seemed like a terrible idea. Glad you
weren't suggesting that.

I'm definitely open to adding a add_links to fwnode ops, but I'm not
sure if fwnode ops changes are frowned upon or not. I'll still need
the device specific edit_links() but that's a separate issue.

Agreed. As long as you don't ask me to implement the ACPI ops :)

Great.

I think we are lining up better now. But still have some more to go :)

Having said that, I'd still like to meet your tomorrow if that's
possible (see Greg's email).
