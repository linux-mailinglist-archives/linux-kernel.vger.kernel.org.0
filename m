Did you consider using a hybrid approach?

Please let me sketch my idea:

- Let's have a worker thread which serves a software queue.
- The software queue is a linked list of requests.
- Upon job submission the driver checks whether the software queue is empty.
- If the software queue is empty the regular submission continues.
- Is the hardware queue full at this point, the request is put on the software
  queue and we return EBUSY.
- If upon job submission the software queue not empty, the new job is also put
  on the software queue.
- The worker thread is woken up every time a new job is put on the software
  queue and every time CAAM processed a job.

That way we can keep the fast path fast. If hardware queue not full, software queue
can be bypassed completely.
If the software queue is used once it will become empty as soon jobs are getting
submitted at a slower rate and the fast path will be used again.

What do you think?

Thanks,
