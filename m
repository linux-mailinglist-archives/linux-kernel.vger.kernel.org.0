I would have been surprised if it had been accepted as is.

Matthew and Greg, thanks for reviewing - I have a feeling you might need 
to do this a few times more.

Over the past few days, I too have been pondering, certain thatthis 
patch, a mini tweak of the existing kernel-doc, is not theright 
answer.Equally, I'm unconvinced that the "right" answer is a wholesale 
move to ReST, so where's the happy medium?

<alert: long email, tldr: "Finding the happy medium on kerneldoc layout 
in C source comments">

A week or two back, I tried to fix doc build "indentation" warnings due 
to return value listsin sfb-bus.c. Russell King didn't like my patch 
saying "I think it's more important that the documentation interferes to 
a minimal degree with the code in the file".[ Mauro's patch to sfb-bus.c 
is now in linux-next. He fixed the problem with a bullet list - 
thriftier with the line breaks andthe official fix in the kerneldoc 
notes - but I'll argue that a simple list or definition list might be 
more appropriate. ]

Russell and Matthew argue that the primary purpose of source annotation 
is to aid developers and that any significant detraction (verbosity, 
whitespace) is not excused by prettier docs. FWIW, my background is 
sysadmin (much perl) and system/kernel programming (mostly C) and I 
agree with them.

Jani, if you see risks of complexity and maintenance problems, then so 
do I. But the point of kernel-doc is surely to be a specific semantic 
markup which works for developers and maintainers and allows doc authors 
access to their annotation.  The format clearly needs thought,perl is 
less fashionable than it was and kernel-doc - er - needs work, but I 
don't see the *idea* as inherently broken. I suggest that there would be 
good developer buy-in to searchable pretty docs if a few compact idioms 
reliably did The Right Thing and didn't spit out doc build warnings.

The build warnings I currently observe do not tell me "the author got it 
wrong", but rather "kernel-doc didn't understand the author's intention".

Consider this excerpt from the kerneldoc comment for bitmap_cut(), 
recently added to lib/bitmap.c. (NB - this is an example in the 
description section - the parameters, including src, have already been 
described).

  * In pictures, example for a big-endian 32-bit architecture:
  *
  * @src:
  * 31                                   63
  * |                                    |
  * 10000000 11000001 11110010 00010101  10000000 11000001 01110010 00010101
  *                 | |              |                                    |
  *                16 14             0                                   32
  *

This fails because 1) the diagram isn't made literal (and so generates a 
indentation build warning) and 2) "@src:" is interpreted as an extra 
definition of src which scrunges the first one. I find it hard to assert 
that the author's intentions were wrong; it's the kind of good 
annotation we should hope for in a newly added function. If "* @src:" 
gained an double colon and we guaranteed that, after a description 
section header, references to a parameter didn't overwrite the original 
definition, this would work fine.

My instinct is to fix doc build issues with minimal changes: not actual 
ReST, but clear idioms reliably generating good ReST. This should be 
accompanied by tests for developers and reviewers so that we can have a 
fair stab at getting it right first time and (of course) documentation.

Could I ask anyone who disagrees to suggest their preferred way to lay 
out the comment for bitmap_cut()?

One head-on approachis to literalise *all* kerneldoc comments for 
functions and structures. The kerneldoc keywords then serve only to 
generate links; the ReST output is minimal but guaranteed validand 
warning free. Would any readers of API docs be inconvenienced? The 
target readership are presumably programmers, and the searchability of 
the sphinx RTD is more useful to me than the formatting.

All the best,
Peter
