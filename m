Subject: I just got to know another 2 Singaporeans who were denied/refused =
government jobs because of their remarks on the Singapore Government

Today, 12 November 2019 Tuesday Singapore Time, I got to know another 2 Sin=
gaporeans who were denied/refused government jobs because of their remarks =
on the Singapore Government.

Donald Trump (not his real name of course), who is a recruitment consultant=
 at job agency Nanotechnology Infocomms (not the real name of the job agenc=
y of course) in Singapore, communicated to me he is aware of another 2 Sing=
aporeans who were denied/refused government jobs because of their remarks o=
n the Singapore Government.

According to Donald Trump, the 1st Singaporean passed the first round of se=
curity clearance but failed the second round of security clearance. On furt=
her thoughts, the 1st Singaporean thought he may have been denied/refused t=
he government job because of his remarks on the Singapore Government.

According to Donald Trump, the 2nd Singaporean was working in a semi-govern=
ment job involving classified information of government ministers in Singap=
ore. According to Donald Trump, the 2nd Singaporean refused to sign Non-Dis=
closure Agreement (NDA) because he argued that government ministers in Sing=
apore are public figures. The 2nd Singaporean was subsequently forced to re=
sign or terminated from employment.

Due to privacy laws in Singapore (Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)), Don=
ald Trump cannot reveal the names of the two Singaporean Targeted Individua=
ls to me. Privacy laws also exist in the European Union and the United Stat=
es.

The General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) is a regulation=
 in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of th=
e European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also address=
es the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aim=
s primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to =
simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying =
the regulation within the EU.[1] Superseding the Data Protection Directive =
95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to th=
e processing of personal data of individuals (formally called data subjects=
 in the GDPR) inside the EEA, and applies to any enterprise established in =
the EEA or-regardless of its location and the data subjects' citizenship-th=
at is processing the personal information of data subjects inside the EEA.

The Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub.L. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896, enacted December 31,=
 1974, Title 5 United States Code Section =A7 552a), a United States federa=
l law, establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the col=
lection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable inf=
ormation about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by fede=
ral agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control o=
f an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individu=
al or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requir=
es that agencies give the public notice of their systems of records by publ=
ication in the Federal Register. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure o=
f information from a system of records absent of the written consent of the=
 subject individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve sta=
tutory exceptions. The Act also provides individuals with a means by which =
to seek access to and amendment of their records and sets forth various age=
ncy record-keeping requirements. Additionally, with people granted the righ=
t to review what was documented with their name, they are also able to find=
 out if the "records have been disclosed".. and are also given the rights t=
o make corrections.[1]

I am now aware I am definitely not alone and I am definitely not the only T=
argeted Individual (TI) in Singapore. So far Donald Trump is the only recru=
itment consultant from only one job agency in Singapore whom I have spoken =
to. Hence there could be a lot more Targeted Individuals out there in Singa=
pore whom I am not aware of yet.
