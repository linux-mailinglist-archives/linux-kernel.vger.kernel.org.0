My point is that this patch does not require backporting, and hence does
not require a fixes tag. The stable AI may choose the patch regardless,
so it's irrelevant.

Given that:

* All the suggested code changes so far are harmful to legibility,
  robustness, and maintainability of the code.

* The majority of the warnings (by orders of magnitude) occur for
  intentional overrides, rather than unintentional overrides, as
  assigning default values to arrays and structs is a common idiom.

* We have no known mechanism to selectively disable the warning on a
  per-assignment basis.

... I do not think that is an appropriate strategy here.

For example, I'm fairly certain that if you try to "fix" the instances
in syscall tables, many more people will complain.

A much better approach would be to analyse the warnings, and either:

* find the _real_ bugs where we unintentionally override fields and fix
  those first, or:

* Find the instances that produce the greatest set of false positives
  (e.g. the syscall tables), and figure out how to suppress those
  without harming the maintainability or robustness of the code.

This isn't arm64-specific. We validly use duplicate assignments all over
the kernel, and my position is that we either:

* Find a mechanism to suppress the warning on a per-assignment (not
  per-file) basis, without altering the structure of the existing code.

* Disable the warning tree-wide.

I would vastly prefer the former, as I do agree that this warning _can_
find real bugs, but similarly so can a script that warns "Line $N may
contain a bug" for every line of a C file.

I agree that we want to minimize the noise, but not at the expense of
the maintainability and robustness of the code, and not by disabling
warnings for arbitrary files.

If that's your position, then I see no point continuing this conversation.

From my analysis in a prior reply, the vast majority of duplicate
assignments in the kernel are intentional. We do that for both arrays
and structures in order to have defaults that can be overridden.

If the compiler developers don't think that's worth supporting, then the
feature is not worth using.

Thanks,
Mark.
