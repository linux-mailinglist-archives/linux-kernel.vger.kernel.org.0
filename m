yeah I dont recall a way to get bus fed into create_group, I did look at
the other examples back then and IIRC and most of them were using a
global to do the trick (I didn't want to go down that route).

I think that was the reason I wrote it this way...

BTW if you do use psedo-device you can create your own struct foo which
embeds device and then then you can use container approach to get foo
(and foo contains bus as a member).

Greg, any thoughts?

Thanks
