I considered this too.  Any IO issued to the device before it is "ready"
won't matter anyway (no where to send the IO due to not having a DM
table -- such IO should result in an error (from dm.c:dm_process_bio's
!map check).  But given the device has no size, a simple write will hit
-ENOSPC before.

And the only way to get the DM device to have a proper destination for
its IO is to load a table, which requires a sequence like:

# dmsetup create -n test
# dmsetup table
test:
# echo "0 20971520 linear 259:0 2048" | dmsetup load test
# dmsetup table --inactive
test: 0 20971520 linear 259:0 2048
# dmsetup suspend test
# dmsetup resume test
# dmsetup table
test: 0 20971520 linear 259:0 2048

And once a table is loaded there will be accompanying change
uevents that trigger udev, blkid, etc.

(NOTE: the suspend phase implies a flush of all outstanding IO, but even
if 'dmsetup suspend --noflush test' were used the IO would just get
pushed onto a list in DM core and it would be issued after the new table
is in place).

That's just mount not having a negative check for device size being 0.
