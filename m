This is exactly what this patch is doing, in fact (it is erasing the
seed from the command line).

So here's one thing we could do; we could require something like:

rng_seed=<nr_bits>,<base-64 encoded string of 32 bytes>

... where the kernel parses rng_seed, and errors out if nr_bits is
greater than 256, and errors out if the base-64 encoded string is not
valid, and then replaces it with the SHA-256 hash of the rng seed,
base-64 encoded.

That way if there is a crappy handset which is just encoding the
device serial number, it becomes painfully obvious that someone is
cheating.

Is that overkill?  Well, from my perspective, we're talking about an
industry that was willing to turn the CPU thermal safety limits when
certain benchmark applications were detected to be running, just to
gain a commercial advantage.  So trust doesn't come easily to me, when
it comes to corporate desires of expediency.  :-)
