Hello,

This patch series factors out system controller multi-function device nodes
for CRT, Iso, Misc, SB2 and SCPU Wrapper IP blocks.

It was inspired by my SoC info RFC, as discussed in its cover letter [1].

Goal of DT is to describe the hardware, and in previous patches we've already
introduced Realtek's r-bus as node layer. The next step here is to model
multi-function blocks as nodes. In order to cope with 80-character line limit,
child nodes are added via reference rather than in-place.

Also included is a patch adding a reset constant for the SB2 block added.
We may need to follow up with bindings adding compatibles, clocks and resets.

This series is based on my RTD1195 v4 [2] (except for reset, rebased here),
my RTD1395 v2 [3] and James' modified RTD1619 v3 [4].

The irq mux series v5 [5] has been rebased onto this series, v6 to be sent.
The SoC info RFC series [1] is still being updated, v2 to be posted later.

Latest experimental patches at:
https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commits/rtd1295-next

Have a lot of fun!

Cheers,
Andreas
