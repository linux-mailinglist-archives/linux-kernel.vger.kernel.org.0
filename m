I am OK having that in another patch, and I will be looking over yours
and Byungchul's two patches tomorrow.  If they look OK, I will queue them.

However, I won't send them upstream without a follow-on patch that gets
rid of the kfree_rcu() special casing within rcu_do_batch() and perhaps
elsewhere.  This follow-on patch would of course also need to change rcuperf
appropriately.

As a stopgap until the follow-on patch, this looks fine.
