Right, so the clocks are enabled as soon as the device is probed,
in other words at boot time. It remains enabled for as long as the
device is bound to its driver, whether or not the device is actually
being used. Every switching edge causes heat to be generated. Every
switching edge causes energy to be wasted.

That's fine if you have an infinite energy supply. That hasn't been
discovered yet.

Given the prevalence of technology, don't you think we should be
doing as much as we possibly can to reduce the energy consumption
of the devices we use? It may be peanuts per device, but at scale
it all adds up.
