I've never heard of these. git-grep says its a powerpc pmu...

(after a quick chat with Andre), is this a cache-miss counter?
If so, its a bit murky, (and beware, I don't know much about perf).
The arch code's armv8_pmu has a 'PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_MISSES' map entry, so yes...
... but if we're measuring this on a cache outside the CPU, we'd need an 'uncore' pmu
driver, so it would depend on what the manufacturer implemented.


I should admit that I'm expecting this selftest to test resctrl, and not depend on a lot
else. Couldn't it use the llc_occupancy value, 50% bitmap gives ~50% lower occupancy. Or
(some combination of) the mbm byte counters, (which would require a seeky workload to
cause repeat re-fills of the same line)...


Thanks,

James
