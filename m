Please remove the empty lines between arguments description. They make

To be sure, the empty lines between paragraphs are useful.
The following is still well readable:

/**
 * _datablock_valid() - Check if given positions yield a valid data block.
 * @dr:         The associated data ringbuffer.
 * @head_lpos:  The newest data logical position.
 * @tail_lpos:  The oldest data logical position.
 * @begin_lpos: The beginning logical position of the data block to check.
 * @next_lpos:  The logical position of the next adjacent data block.
 *              This value is used to identify the end of the data block.

 * A data block is considered valid if it satisfies the two conditions:
 *
 * * tail_lpos <= begin_lpos < next_lpos <= head_lpos
 * * tail_lpos is at most exactly 1 wrap behind head_lpos
 *
 * Return: true if the specified data block is valid.

This human readable description is really useful.

But I am not sure how much this is useful. It would take ages to decrypt
all these shortcuts (signs) and translate them into something
human readable. Also it might get outdated easily.

That said, I haven't found yet if there was a system in all
the shortcuts. I mean if they can be descrypted easily
out of head. Also I am not familiar with the notation
of the dependencies.

If this is really needed then I am really scared of some barriers
that guard too many things. This one is a good example.

It would be great if all these shortcuts (signs) are followed with
something human readable. Few words might be enough.

This is too scattered. If we really need so many shortcuts (signs)
then we should find a better style. The following looks perfectly
fine to me:

		/* aA: Adresss dependency on @id. */
