I was basically imagining a hardware that I don't have at the moment.
So I do not know the answer, but I think the answer may be yes.

I'll wait for suggestions.

What I did not quite understand about the use of a local state in
software is what does this local software state buy us? Even with
local state, in the "set_property" flow, we'll update it at the same
time when we flush it out to hardware. Is it about avoiding an ACPI
call during the "get_property" flow? Also, is it worth it if i brings
with it complexity of interrupt handling?

OK, I do not mind changing to whatever is acceptable. Jani / Daniel,
do you have any recommendation here?

Yes, I agree that finding an ACPI node corresponding to a connector,

Ah, OK, I see where the disconnect was. Sure, I think we are converging now=

Sure, I agree and will change the naming.

That's a good idea. I'll check it out to see if it matches my needs.
If it does, I think we might have found a way to make it totally
separate from i915. I don't have a vast range of test hardware and
monitors etc to test though. So I'll test with what I have available.

I'll keep you updated.

OK, I understand what you are saying. The ACPI handle essentially
denotes the firmware node for that drm_connector device, analogous to
the device tree nodes. Ideally, I wanted to have it stored in the
drm_connector->kdev->fwnode which I think was the best place as it
would also make the ACPI node visible in the sysfs like it is visible
for PCI devices today. Unfortunately I found that the
drm_connector->kdev is not created at the time when I need to lookup
and register privacy screen (kdev is created much later), so that is
not an option. Note that the drm_privacy_screen_set_val() and
drm_privacy_screen_get_val() will need to access this ACPI handle to
do their jobs. So unless I move that code or the property representing
privacy screen also into i915, I can't really put that handle in i915.
