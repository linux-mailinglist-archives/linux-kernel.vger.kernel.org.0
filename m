Yeah this is how it looks. All the callback from range_start #1 would
happens before range_start #2 happens so we should be fine.

No that would be illegal for a callback to do that. There is no existing
callback that would do that at least AFAIK. So we can just say that it
is illegal. I would not see the point.

I think we are fine. So this patch looks good.
