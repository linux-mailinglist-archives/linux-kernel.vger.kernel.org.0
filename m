Not exactly sure what is missing from my paragraph. The way I see it has
more information as it states what is used at as the vessel for
exportation (the custom configuration table).

Maybe something like:

"Thus, it nees to save the final events table size at the time to the
custom configuration table so that the TPM driver can later on skip the
events generated during the preboot time."
