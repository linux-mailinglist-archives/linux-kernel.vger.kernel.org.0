Good news, everyone! We've found conditions when HPET counter returns '-1'.

clocksource: timekeeping watchdog on CPU21: Marking clocksource 'tsc' as unstable because the skew is too large:
clocksource:                       'hpet' wd_now: ffffffff wd_last: 40bc1ee3 mask: ffffffff
clocksource:                       'tsc' cs_now: 919b39935acdaa cs_last: 919b3957c0ec24 mask: ffffffffffffffff
clocksource: Switched to clocksource hpet

This happens when user-space does inappropriate access to directly mapped HPET.
For example dumping whole "vvar" area: memcpy(buf, addr("vvar"), 0x3000).

In our case sequence was triggered by bug in "atop" crashed at "\n" in task comm. =)

In upstream everything is fine. Direct access to HPET was sealed in 4.7 (we seen bug in 4.4)

Kudos to Arseny Smalyuk for (accidental) reproducing and investigation.
