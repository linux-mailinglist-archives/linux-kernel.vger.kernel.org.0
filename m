... which doesn't actually do anything in the Linux implementation.

It only has one register. :)

Essentially yes.  The issue is translating the ACPI tables into
actions to be taken by the Linux Power Management APIs.  Again, we've
requested documentation.  Now, we wait ...

This is my assumption too.

Also correct.  You would be left with a huge duplication of code
across each of the SEs however.

I see some _DEPs which detail the MMU{0,1}, but that's about it.

Right, but that doesn't mean that the current driver design is
correct.  ACPI, which is in theory a description of the hardware
doesn't seem to think so.  It looks more like we do this in Linux as a
convenience function to link the devices.  Instead this 'parent' seems
to be represented as a very small register space at the end of the SE
banks.

Amazing, thank you!

Do you know how we go about getting this merged?  We only potentially
have 0.5 weeks (1.5 weeks if there is an -rc8 [doubtful]), so we need
to move fast.  Would you be prepared to send it to Linus for -fixes?
I'd do it myself, but this is a little out of my remit.

Nothing heard from Andy for a very long time.

Great.
