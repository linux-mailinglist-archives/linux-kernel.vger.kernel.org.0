I'd nuance this to *SMT* capacity (which isn't just servers). The thing is
that it's difficult to come up with a sensible scheme to describe the base
capacity of a single logical CPU. But yeah, valid point.

Right, if/when we get things like per-unit signals (wasn't there something
about tracking AVX a few months back?) then we'll be able to make
more informed decisions, for now we'll need some handholding (read: task
classification).

This goes back to my reply to Patrick further up the thread.

Right now active balance can happen just because we've been imbalanced for
some time and repeatedly failed to migrate anything. After 3 (IIRC) successive
failed attempts, we'll active balance the running task of the remote rq we
decided was busiest.

If that happens to be a latency sensitive task, that's not great - active
balancing means stopping that task's execution, so we're going to add some
latency to this latency-sensitive task. My proposal was to further ratelimit
active balance (e.g. require more failed attempts) when the task that would be
preempted is latency-sensitive.

My point is: if that task is doing fine where it is, why preempt it? That's
just introducing latency IMO (keeping in mind that those balance attempts
could happen despite not having any thermal pressure).

If you care about performance (e.g. a minimum level of throughput), to me
that is a separate (though perhaps not entirely distinct) property.

Don't we all!

Hmm perhaps I was jumping the gun here. What I was getting to is if you have
something like misfit that migrates tasks to CPUs of higher capacity than the
one they are on, you could use uclamp to flag them.

You could translate your throughput requirement as a uclamp.min of e.g. 80%,
and if the CPU capacity goes below that (or close within a margin) then you'd
try to migrate the task to a CPU of higher capacity (i.e. not or less 
thermally pressured).

This doesn't have to involve your less throughput-sensitive tasks, since you
would only tag and take action for your throughput-sensitive tasks.
