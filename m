series of vma in parent with shared AV:

SRC1 - AV0
SRC2 - AV0
SRC3 - AV0
...
SRCn - AV0

in child after fork

DST1 - AV_OLD_1 (some old vma, picked by anon_vma_clone) plus DST1 is attached to same AVs as SRC1
DST2 - AV_OLD_2 (other old vma) plus DST1 is attached to same AVs as SRC2
DST2 - AV1 prev AV parent does not match AV0, no old vma found for reusing -> allocate new one (child of AV0)
DST3 - AV1 - DST2->AV->parent == SRC3->AV (AV0) -> share AV with prev
DST4 - AV1 - same thing
...
DSTn - AV1

Picking ancestor AV in anon_vma_clone instead of allocating new one.
