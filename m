Rename the mmc documentation files to ReST, add an
index for them and adjust in order to produce a nice html
output via the Sphinx build system.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

+MMC Asynchronous Request
+========================

 Rationale
 =========
 
 How significant is the cache maintenance overhead?
+
 It depends. Fast eMMC and multiple cache levels with speculative cache
 pre-fetch makes the cache overhead relatively significant. If the DMA
 preparations for the next request are done in parallel with the current
 transfer, the DMA preparation overhead would not affect the MMC performance.
+
 The intention of non-blocking (asynchronous) MMC requests is to minimize the
 time between when an MMC request ends and another MMC request begins.

 Using mmc_wait_for_req(), the MMC controller is idle while dma_map_sg and
 dma_unmap_sg are processing. Using non-blocking MMC requests makes it
 possible to prepare the caches for next job in parallel with an active

 The first request in a series of requests can't be prepared in parallel
 with the previous transfer, since there is no previous request.
+
 The argument is_first_req in pre_req() indicates that there is no previous
 request. The host driver may optimize for this scenario to minimize
 the performance loss. A way to optimize for this is to split the current
 request in two chunks, prepare the first chunk and start the request,
 and finally prepare the second chunk and start the transfer.
