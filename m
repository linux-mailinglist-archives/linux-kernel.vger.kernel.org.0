I did not check the code, sorry.

I still believe your shutdown voltage is too low; try that. Battery will go down from 3V
to 2.8V in seconds, so you don't really gain anything by using lower threshold, and you
may not even have enough time to shutdown the system if you set it too low.

Normally something like 3.0V, 3.2V is reasonable shutdown voltage.

Best regards,
