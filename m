It should be symmetric. It makes sense that _dataring_pop() uses an
smp_rmb(). Then there should be wmb() in dataring_push().

The wmb() should be done only by the CPU that actually did the write.
And it should be done after the write. This is why I suggested to
do it after cmpxchg(dr->head_lpos).

I do not understand it. Full memory barrier will not cause that all
CPUs will see the same.

My understanding of barriers is:

   + wmb() is needed after some value is modified and any following
     modifications must be done later.

   + rmb() is needed when a value has to be read before the other
     values are read.

These barriers need to be symmetric. The reader will see the values
in the right order only when both the writer and the reader use
the right barriers.

    + wmb() full barrier is needed around some critical section
      to make sure that all operations happened inside the section


Back to our situation:

    + rmb() should not be needed here because get_new_lpos() provided
      a valid lpos.

      It is possible that get_new_lpos() used rmb() to make sure
      that there was enough space. But such wmb() would be
      between reading dr->tail_lpos and dr->head_lpos. No
      other rmb() is needed once the check passed.

    + wmb() is not needed because we have not written anything yet

If there was a race with another CPU than cmpxchg(dr->head_lpos)
would fail and we will need to repeat everything again.

smp_mb() is not a problem. printk() is a slow path.

My problem is that I want to make sure that the code works as
expected. For this, I want to understand the used barriers.
And the discussed full barrier in dataring_push() does not make
sense to me.
