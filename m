As the comment states, this release is for prb_getdesc() users. The only
prb_getdesc() user is _dataring_pop(). If getdesc() returns NULL
(i.e. the descriptor's ID is not what _dataring_pop() was expecting),
then the tail must have moved and _dataring_pop() needs to see
that. Since there are no data dependencies between descriptor ID and
tail_pos, an explicit memory barrier is used. More on this below.

The issue is that _dataring_pop() needs to see a moved dataring tail if
prb_getdesc() fails. Just because numlist_pop() succeeded, doesn't mean
that this was the task that changed the dataring tail. I.e. another CPU
could observe that this task changed the ID but _not_ yet see that
another task changed the dataring tail.

Issuing an smp_mb() before setting the the new ID would also suffice,
but that is a pretty big hammer for something that a set_release can
take care of.

Keep in mind that dataring and numlist were written independent of the
ringbuffer. They are structures with very specific purposes and their
own set of variables (and memory barriers to order _those_
variables). The high-level ringbuffer also has its own variables and
memory barriers. Sometimes there is overlap, which is implemented in the
callbacks (as is here), which is why the dataring callback getdesc() has
the implementation requirement that a following smp_rmb() by the caller
will guarantee seeing an updated dataring tail. But these overlaps are
the exception, not the rule.

I think trying to see "everything at once" with a top-down view is going
to seem too complex and hurt your brain. I think it would be easier to
verify the internal consistency of the individual dataring and numlist
structures first. Once you have faith in the integrity of those
structures, moving to the high-level ringbuffer is a much smaller step.
