Thank you for the detailed explanation. I'll try to bring useful
information to sort this out. IIUC, this bloc exports:

1/ One ROM located in the SoC
2/ The access to a possible second ROM over SPI

And also:

3/ Access to the SPI controller itself
4/ Access to 1/ or 2/ depending on an external switch.

IMHO:

1/ Might be seen as a random MTD device, its driver should be in
   /drivers/mtd/devices I guess.
3/ Is a SPI controller, its driver should be memory agnostic and
   located in /driver/spi/. However, it should probably implement
   the spi-mem infrastructure *and* the direct-mapping infrastructure
   which would automatically cover 2/ as well. The reg property of 2/
   should probably be part of 3/.

For 4/ I don't know what is the right thing to do yet.

What do you think?
