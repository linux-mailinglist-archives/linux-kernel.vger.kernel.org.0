These look good as a way of seeing if there are any outstanding callbacks,
but in the case of Tree RCU, call_rcu_outstanding() would almost never
return false on a busy system.

Here are some alternatives:

o	RCU uses some pieces of Rao Shoaib kfree_rcu() patches.
	The idea is to make kfree_rcu() locally buffer requests into
	batches of (say) 1,000, but processing smaller batches when RCU
	is idle, or when some smallish amout of time has passed with
	no more kfree_rcu() request from that CPU.  RCU than takes in
	the batch using not call_rcu(), but rather queue_rcu_work().
	The resulting batch of kfree() calls would therefore execute in
	workqueue context rather than in softirq context, which should
	be much easier on the system.

	In theory, this would allow people to use kfree_rcu() without
	worrying quite so much about overload.  It would also not be
	that hard to implement.

o	Subsystems vulnerable to user-induced kfree_rcu() flooding use
	call_rcu() instead of kfree_rcu().  Keep a count of the number
	of things waiting for a grace period, and when this gets too
	large, disable the optimization.  It will then drain down, at
	which point the optimization can be re-enabled.

	But please note that callbacks are -not- guaranteed to run on
	the CPU that queued them.  So yes, you would need a per-CPU
	counter, but you would need to periodically sum it up to check
	against the global state.  Or keep track of the CPU that
	did the call_rcu() so that you can atomically decrement in
	the callback the same counter that was atomically incremented
	just before the call_rcu().  Or any number of other approaches.

Also, the overhead is important.  For example, as far as I know,
current RCU gracefully handles close(open(...)) in a tight userspace
loop.  But there might be trouble due to tight userspace loops around
lighter-weight operations.

So an important question is "Just how fast is your ioctl?"  If it takes
(say) 100 microseconds to execute, there should be absolutely no problem.
On the other hand, if it can execute in 50 nanoseconds, this very likely
does need serious attention.

Other thoughts?
