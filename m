From the other thread:

Without annotations it's hard to tell. The problem is that the
compiler can still emit a word-sized load, even if you're just
checking 1 bit. The instrumentation emitted for KCSAN only cares about
loads/stores, where access size is in number of bytes and not bits,
since that's what the compiler has to emit.  So, strictly speaking
these are data races: concurrent reads / writes where at least one
access is plain.

With the above caveat out of the way, we already have the following
defaults in KCSAN (after similar requests):
1. KCSAN ignores same-value stores, i.e. races with writes that appear
to write the same value do not result in data race reports.
2. KCSAN does not demand aligned writes (including things like 'var++'
if there are no concurrent writers) up to word size to be marked (with
READ_ONCE etc.), assuming there is no way for the compiler to screw
these up. [I still recommend writes to be marked though, if at all
possible, because I'm still not entirely convinced it's always safe!]

So, because of (2), KCSAN will not complain if you have something like
'flags |=3D SOME_FLAG' (where the read is marked). Because of (1), it'll
still complain about 'flags & SOME_FLAG' though, since the load is not
marked, and only sees this is a word-sized access (assuming flags is a
long) where a bit changed.

I don't think it's possible to easily convey to KCSAN which bits of an
access you only care about, so that we could extend (1).   Ideas?

This could work, but 'READ_BITS()' is enough, if KCSAN's same-value
filter is default on anyway.  Although my preference is also to avoid
more macros if possible.

I agree that data_race() would be the most suitable here, since
technically it's still a data race. It just so happens that we end up
"throwing away" most of the bits of the access, and just care about a
few bits.
