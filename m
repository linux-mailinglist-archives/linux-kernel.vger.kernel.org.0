That at least requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the current user namespace. But
it seems potentially dangerous when you think about cross-user-namespace
interactions, e.g. execing a binary located on the host and doing
setns(mnt+user).

Relying on /proc/<pid>/exe for anything has been a constant source of
bugs and is something we have warned against. The rexec trick we do for
both runC and lxc nowadays when attaching/running containers are
basically ways to ensure that you're executing an in-memory program that
has no attachment to the actual on-disk binary and is a result of
problems like this.

The use-case that e.g. comes from system daemons is that they need to
talk to e.g. glibc's syslog() api. And daemon loggers need to know who
they are talking to and that needs to be race-free. And they don't get
sent fds. Assuming we can patch glibc and all loggers to send a
pidfd and put a contract in place saying any message without a pidfd
sent along or a pidfd that is not referring to the SO_PEERCREDs uid
sent along will be rejected still feels wrong. In such cases the daemon
wants to be in control and requested the credentials be given to him. So
I can see the use for another SO_*
