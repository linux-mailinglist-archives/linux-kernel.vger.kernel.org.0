Thanks for your review!
Sorry for that, I'm not clear about the original issue the patch
3f8fd02b1bf1 ("mm/vmalloc: Sync unmappings in __purge_vmap_area_lazy()")
fixed.

I just get that limitation info from the commit log as following:
"
This is only needed x86-32 with !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD, which is the case on 
a PAE kernel with PTI enabled. On affected systems the missing sync 
causes old mappings to persist in some page-tables, causing data 
corruption and other undefined behavior.
"

Hi, Joerg
Could you please help to recall the original issue you encountered before?
Thanks!
