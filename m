So this looks generally good, but...

I honestly can't see the value of fixing up a line like that.  When I
encounter a kernel document that references something like 2.2.10, I assume
it's full of dust and cobwebs.  I'd just take that out.

This could be tweaked as well.  If, after your work, you think it's still
not current, a warning to that effect should be put in instead.

There's some other dated stuff below that can go as well.  Probably this is
best done in a separate patch.
