I suspect the integration with glibc and with dlopen'd/dlclose'd libraries will not
behave correctly with the current tcmalloc implementation.

Based on the tcmalloc code-base, InitFastPerCpu is only called from IsFast. As long
as this is the only expected caller, having IsFast comparing the RseqCpuId detects
whether glibc (or some other library) has already registered rseq for the current
thread.

However, if the application chooses to invoke InitFastPerCpu() directly, things become
expected, because it invokes:

  absl::base_internal::LowLevelCallOnce(&init_per_cpu_once, InitPerCpu);

which AFAIU invokes InitPerCpu once after execution of the current program. Which
does:

static bool InitThreadPerCpu() {
  if (__rseq_refcount++ > 0) {
    return true;
  }

  auto ret = syscall(__NR_rseq, &__rseq_abi, sizeof(__rseq_abi), 0,
                     PERCPU_RSEQ_SIGNATURE);
  if (ret == 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    __rseq_refcount--;
  }

  return false;
}

static void InitPerCpu() {
  // Based on the results of successfully initializing the first thread, mark
  // init_status to initialize all subsequent threads.
  if (InitThreadPerCpu()) {
    init_status = kFastMode;
  }
}

In a scenario where glibc has already registered Rseq, the __rseq_refcount will
be incremented, the __NR_rseq syscall will fail with -1, errno=EBUSY, so the refcount
will be immediately decremented and it will return false. Therefore, "init_status" will
never be set fo kFastMode, leaving it in kSlowMode for the entire lifetime of this
program. That being said, even though this state can come as a surprise, it seems to
be entirely bypassed by the fast-paths IsFast() and IsFastNoInit(), so maybe it won't
have any observable side-effects other than leaving init_status in a state that does not
match reality.

In the other use-case where tcmalloc co-exist with a dlopened/dlclosed library, but glibc
does not provide Rseq registration, we run into issues as well if the dlopened library
registers rseq first for a given thread. The IsFastNoInit() expects that if Rseq has been
observed as registered in the past for a thread, it stays registered. However, if a
dlclosed library unregisters Rseq, we need to be prepared to re-register it. So either
tcmalloc needs to express its use of Rseq by incrementing __rseq_refcount even when Rseq
is registered (this would hurt the fast-path however, and I would hate to have to do this),
or tcmalloc needs to be able to handle the fact that Rseq may be unregistered by a dlclosed
library which was the actual owner of the Rseq registration.

Thanks,

Mathieu
