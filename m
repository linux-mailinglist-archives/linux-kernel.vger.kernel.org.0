This one, too, could user a bit less markup, and more consistent markup.
If you have to mark up literal text, for example, it should be ``literal``,
not *emphasis*.  But please think about whether it needs marking up at all.

I have one other thing here, that could use input from the vfat maintainer:

What are the chances that the above email address works at all, especially
given that the associated web page has to be dug out of the wayback
machine?  We should really try to avoid perpetuating obviously wrong
information when we can.  Hirofumi, do you have any thoughts on what might
replace this section?
