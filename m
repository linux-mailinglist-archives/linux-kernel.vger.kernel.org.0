Gaah. I was looking at the input randomness, since I thought that was
where the added randomness that Ahmed got things to work with came
from.

And that then made me just look at the legacy disk randomness (for the
obvious disk IO reasons) and I didn't look further.

So that's 4k interrupts if I counted right, and yeah, maybe Ahmed was
just close enough before, and the merging of the inode table IO then
took him below that limit.

Well, even on a PC, sometimes rdrand just isn't there. AMD has screwed
it up a few times, and older Intel chips just don't have it.

So I'd be inclined to either lower the limit regardless - and perhaps
make the "user space asked for randomness much too early" be a big
*warning* instead of being a basically fatal hung machine?
