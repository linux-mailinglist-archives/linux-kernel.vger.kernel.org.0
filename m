My read is the consensus was that pretending to be EFI is a bad idea
unless we're going to behave like EFI.

As far as I can tell Greg made that suggestion here:

https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20190603072916.GA7545@kroah.com/

Then walked back on that suggestion after Matthew pointed out that
efivars is separate because of the immutability requirement and the
odd update semantics:

https://lwn.net/ml/linux-fsdevel/20190605081301.GA23180@kroah.com/

Considering the whole point of this is to present the same user-facing
interface so shouldn't you be dealing with all the problems that
interface creates?

That's true, but...

We avoid some of the potential problems of selecting CONFIG_EFI and we
gain a bunch of other potential problems since you've hacked the
makefiles to build code that's normally CONFIG_EFI only.

> * is using efivar hooks to expose secure variables for tool compatibility

Here's the real problem. For compatibility with the existing userspace
tooling, which expects UEFI,  you need to present the same interface
with the same semantics. Trying to not use efivarfs means you've
already lost since you no longer have the same interface. So how is
this an improvement? I think the options here are to either:

1) Come up with a new interface, implement it, and adapt the user
tooling to deal with the new API.

*or*

2) Use efivarsfs and fix the based i-cant-believe-its-not-efi variable
backend so it behaves *exactly* like the UEFI get/setVariable APIs.
This means that you need to validate the update certificates at
runtime. I don't think this is a huge strech since you're already
implementing the validator.

1) gives you the flexibility to change the key hierarchy and whatnot,
while 2) means we've got less weird powerpc crap for users to deal
with. I have no strong opinions about which you choose to do, but
don't do this.
