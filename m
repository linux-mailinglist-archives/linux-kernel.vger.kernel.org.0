Subject: [PATCH RESEND V4 0/1] perf: Add CPU hotplug support for events 
Date:   Tue, 18 Jun 2019 19:16:56 +0530

The embedded world, specifically Android mobile SoCs, rely on CPU
hotplugs to manage power and thermal constraints. These hotplugs
can happen at a very rapid pace. Adjacently, they also relies on
many perf event counters for its management. Therefore, there is
a need to preserve these events across hotplugs.

In such a scenario, a perf client (kernel or user-space) can create
events even when the CPU is offline. If the CPU comes online during
the lifetime of the event, the registered event can start counting
spontaneously. As an extension to this, the events' count can also
be preserved across CPU hotplugs. This takes the burden off of the
clients to monitor the state of the CPU.

The tests were conducted on arm64 device.
/* CPU-1 is offline: Event created when CPU1 is offline */

/ # cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
1
/ # echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

Test used for testing
#!/bin/sh

chmod +x *

# Count the cycles events on cpu-1 for every 200 ms
./perf stat -e cycles -I 200 -C 1 &

# Make the CPU-1 offline and online continuously
while true; do
        sleep 2
        echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
        sleep 2
        echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
done
