Sorry for the late response.

Thanks Alexander, indeed it looks much simpler.
I've checked it with Nuvoton's TPM - basic TPM commands work, I only
had to remove the first msg from the read/write I2C transmitting
(from/to TPM_LOC_SEL), the TPM couldn't handle two register writes in
a sequence.
Actually it is more efficient to set TPM_LOC_SEL only before locality
check/request/relinquish - it is sticky.
I still didn't manage to work with interrupts, will debug it.

We weren't aware to the implementation of Christophe/ST which looks
good and can be complement to yours.
If no one is currently working on that, we can prepare a new patch
that is based on both.
Please let us know.

I2C is noisy bus with potentially more devices with larger variety
than SPI. I2C may have more than one master and may have collisions
and/or arbitration.
Still we can start w/o CRC for the first stage and add it later.
BTW, Christophe already did most of the work
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8628661/)

Got it. We hope things will work for us without having another driver,
but it's an option.
