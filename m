'the change' is an INT3 poke, so either you see the old code flow, or
you see an INT3 emulate the old flow in your trace.

That should be unambiguous.

Then you emit the RECORD_TEXT_POKE with the new instruction on. This
prepares the decoder to accept a new reality.

Then we finish the instruction poke.

And then when the trace no longer shows INT3 exceptions, you know the
new code is in effect.

How is this ambiguous?
