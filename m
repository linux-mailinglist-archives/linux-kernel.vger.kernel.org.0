Hmm, I can't see at the moment how you can use GFP_KERNEL here for
!CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels since that sleeps and you can't detect easily if you
are in an RCU reader on !CONFIG_PREEMPT unless lockdep is turned on (in which
case you could have checked lockdep's map).

How about for !PREEMPT using first: GFP_NOWAIT and second GFP_ATOMIC if
(NOWAIT fails)?  And for PREEMPT, use GFP_KERNEL, then GFP_ATOMIC (if
GFP_KERNEL fails).  Thoughts?

thanks,
