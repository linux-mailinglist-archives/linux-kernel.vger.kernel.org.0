I don't understand, may not get your point. KASLR will randomize the
position of kernel image. However, kernel image usually takes up 50M
memory. Under low 4G memory, how come it can't reserve 256M crashkernel
low memory. Do you have the boot log of the failed case?

Someone ever told that some systems may not have low 4G memory since
they own hardware iommu. In real life, I never see such kind of system,
and most of them can give 256M crashkernel memory a satisfactory result.
Unless you reserve more than 1G under low 4G, it could fail because of
kinds of complicated memory reservations there.
