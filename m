The concept sounds sane but the implementation is going to be not much
fun. The problem is that a clk can be in many different parent caches,
even ones for clks that aren't currently parented to it. We would need
to walk the entire tree(s) and find anywhere that we've cached the
clk_core pointer and invalidate it. Maybe we can speed that up a little
bit by keeping a reference to the entry of each parent cache that is for
the parent we're removing, essentially holding an inverse cache, but I'm
not sure it will provide any benefit besides wasting space for this one
operation that we shouldn't be doing very often if at all.

It certainly sounds easier to iterate through the whole tree and just
invalidate entries in all the caches under the prepare lock. We can
optimize it later.

Nitpick. I'd prefer another function to invalidate the cache of a clk
given another clk_core pointer.
