Not while the process is running afaik. Given the right permission there
are some tricks you can do to overwrite the host binary and trick
someone into rexecuting itself and thus the ovewritten binary (There's
been an exploit in runC around this which Aleksa and I fixed a while
back.) but as long as the process is running you can't overwrite it
(unless there are bugs).

You can translate solely from a pidfd to a pid and then open /proc/<pid>
and verify that the directory you just opened referes to the same
process as the pidfd. That's illustrated in a sample program I wrote.
It's located in the kernel sources at:

samples/pidfd/pidfd_metadata.c

specifically the pidfd_metadata_fd() helper.

If you only have the pidfd and want to know the pid of the process you
can translate from the fd's fdinfo file to the pid. That's e.g. how
systemd is doing it too. See
https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/06ae8800d0bd9f8b01df7443daec37f90708bd84/src/basic/process-util.c#L1499
If the process has already exited _and_ been reaped fdinfo will show -1
as pid. The format of the fdinfo file matches the output for the Pid:
and NSpid: fields in the /prop/<pid>/status file.
