Candidates to use a helper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

acpi_is_property_guid(): seems like a candidate
nfit_spa_type(): seems like a candidate

xfs_uuid_unmount(): it looks for dups and holes

lmLogFileSystem(): it looks for holes


Below just users where UUID is a member of structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

visorbus_match() has two deviations: it uses embedded member and according to
code it allows having duplicate UUIDs, though it seems a side effect of not
strictly written code.

publish_vbus_dev_info()
tee_client_device_match()
hv_vmbus_dev_match()
hv_get_dev_type()
mei_cl_device_find()
ishtp_fw_cl_by_uuid()
is_unsupported_vmbus_devs()

...and few more.
