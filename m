As I already mentioned when discussing this upstream:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-serial&m=152460460418058&w=2

I am afraid that a whitelist is not going to fly, that means
duplicating all the device-ids in all the relevant drivers and that
everytime we add a device-id we need to do so in 2 places. Just take
a look at drivers/bluetooth/hci_bcm.c at the device-id list starting
at line 1187 and that is just 1 driver.

I also mention a hack for RTL8723BS devices there, but those have
gotten a proper in kernel driver in the mean time.

Looking at the ACPI device id list in the proposed upstream fix
with a "hsuart serdev driver":
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg30035.html

+static const struct acpi_device_id hsuart_acpi_match[] = {
+	{"INT3511", 0},
+	{"INT3512", 0},
+	{ },
+};

Then blacklist with just these 2 ids would clearly be a much better
approach, as we are talking 2 ids vs 50+ ids here for whitelist vs
blacklist.

The whitepaper on this:
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/enabling-multi-com-port-white-paper.pdf
Also mentions these 2 as "the default Hardware IDs (INT3511 and INT3512) used here are Intel HS-UART COM
port peripheral device IDs." as the hardware ids to use if the port has no
specific function, in other words to use these 2 ids when under Linux the
serial-port should just show up as a /dev/ttyS* device.

So I believe that the fix here is using a blacklist with just these 2
ids in there.

Regards,

Hans
