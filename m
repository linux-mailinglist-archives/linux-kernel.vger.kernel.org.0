For some further testing, by changing the advertisment on the DSA
switch (other end of this platform's link):

        Link partner advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
                                             100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full
...
        Speed: 100Mb/s
        Duplex: Full
===============
        Link partner advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
                                             100baseT/Half
...
        Speed: 100Mb/s
        Duplex: Half
===============
        Link partner advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full
...
        Speed: 10Mb/s
        Duplex: Full
===============
        Link partner advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half
...
        Speed: 10Mb/s
        Duplex: Half

So it looks like the commit works as it should.  So there's something
else going on.

Note that the FEC does *not* support 1000baseT/Half.
