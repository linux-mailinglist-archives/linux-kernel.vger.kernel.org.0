Yep, for containers proper accounting is important, especially cpu usage.

We're using manual kwapd-style reclaim in userspace by MADV_STOCKPILE
within container where memory allocation latency is critical.

This patch is about less extreme cases which would be nice to handle
automatically, without custom tuning.

Besides latency which might be not so important for everybody I see these:

First problem is a fairness within cgroup - task that generates allocation
flow isn't throttled after passing high limits as documentation states.
It will feel memory pressure only after hitting max limit while other
tasks with smaller allocations will go into direct reclaim right away.

Second is an accumulating too much deferred reclaim - after large gup task
might call direct reclaim with target amount much larger than gap between
high and max limits, or even larger than max limit itself.
