I think a lot of cases, panel-id could simply be an integer 0..N, but
for the snapdragon windows devices, they seem to assign each panel a
unique id.  For example, the two possible panels that we've seen on
the c630 are 0xc4 and 0xc5.  I think all the values we've seen so far
on other aarch64 laptops fit in an u8, but the actual value is defined
as u32.  The meaning behind those values is not really terribly
important (and might well be arbitrary.. I'm not sure why they didn't
go with a GUID).  All that matters is they match what DtbLoader pulls
out of the u32 PanelId field in the UEFIDisplayInfo variable.  The
intention behind describing the value as "opaque" was simply "don't
assume it has to be 0..N".

As far as using phandles, I had toyed around with the idea.. the ideal
thing would be if I could compile the dtb with an unresolved phandle
link, and then fixup that link in DtbLoader based on panel-id.  But
this seems not to be possible, afaict I'd have to create a dummy node
for the phandle to point to.  Maybe I'm missing something, if there
were a way to do this then I could make this work without any drm
patches.  Ofc I'm open to suggestions.

yup, this was to ensure that the other panels don't probe, which was a
problem pointed out by robher with my previous approach

I'd be pretty happy if this (or whatever the eventual solution is)
covers all the possible multi-sourced panel cases.. this comes up in
nearly all consumer devices (laptops, phones, etc) and we pretty badly
need an upstream solution for this.
