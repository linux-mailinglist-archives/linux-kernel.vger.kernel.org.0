I mean that in the typical case you have *one* main *parent* symbol defining
one device driver for one piece of hardware.

Yes but that is different than what is trying to be addressed.

Absolutely, but *that* is a different problem! But I am glad you brought
that up and acknowledge it. Addressing that problem will take time and
folks are working towards it. Addressing that problem will still however
not address the problem being addressed here.

Right..

Yes. The localmodconfig approach is to keep enabled as modules *all* currently
enabled modules, that covers that.

But again, this is a separate problem. The one I am addressing, on
behalf of Cristina, is a subspace, dedicated towards *hardware*
functionality.

Right. This does not mean that this information of parent main symbol is
not useful. And having it available on the modules can help with
multiple goals, without requiring kernel sources.

For backports it means you can enable only what you need, or at least
show users what modules in a backports release could be upgraded and let
you enable / disable them.  For other users, people can care about build
time. And not everyone has fancy systems to build all modules; and
sometimes you may just want to enable a small qemu system and build
locally on it, enabling all modules on such systems would just be
extremely silly.

Particularly for me, yes. Others have other needs and I have already
stated clearly what the gains are.

The academic consensus is kconfig semantics are poo and we need to do
slowly start addressing this. I believe that striving towards having
one kconfig symbol per hw component can help long term, and in the
meantime, this also will help with the 'make localmodconfig' and
backport users.

> good luck!

This is not about luck. If you don't want to address these problems,
that's fine, but please provide objective considerations rather than
right out rejection without a reasonable basis. Or even better, provide
alternative recommendations.

The alternative Christoph recommended is hugely instrusive, no one is
working on it, and the simple solution proposed in this thread at least
gets us a small step forward in helping to enable a few more users,
while also postulating if we should strive towards having one main kconfig
for each hw component. Since it seems this is already the case, and
there are only a few outliers, this effort should help spot outliers
and address them to help with our semantics.
