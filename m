Although my series doesn't touch the pagewalk code, it rather borrowed 
some concepts from it and used for the apply_to_page_range() interface.

The reason being that the pagewalk code requires the mmap_sem to be held 
(mainly for trans-huge pages and reading the vma->vm_flags if I 
understand the code correctly). That is fine when you scan the vmas of a 
process, but the helpers I wrote need to instead scan all vmas pointing 
into a struct address_space, and taking the mmap_sem for each vma will 
create lock inversion problems.
