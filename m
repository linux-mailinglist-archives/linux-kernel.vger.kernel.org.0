QUOTE:

"Just an update for anyone with a similar issue - with some fresh eyes 
and some more googling it sounds like this may be caused by some SMTP 
rate limitations built into the AWS EC2 network as Spam prevention.

They have a form to register to remove outgoing smtp connection 
limitations here:

https://aws.amazon.com/forms/ec2-email-limit-rdns-request

I've submitted and will update if this resolves the issues I was 
seeing."

QUOTE:

"Amazon SMTP traffic management indeed seems to have been the cause. 
Within a couple of hours of filling out the above form, I got an email 
confirmation from AWS that "traffic restrictions had been removed" and 
normal function resumed immediately.

Confusing the matters is that this SMTP traffic management is not 
documented well (and sometimes with contradicting information). It does 
not appear to be a hard cap limit, nor does it trigger any notification 
when it's applied - it actually appears to be a *throttle* on common 
SMTP ports, triggered by a very small number of connections, beyond 
which it allows a certain number of connections per/hour - which would 
absolutely create the kind of "intermittent" connectivity issues I saw 
(and the odd delivery order of mail in the queue depending on when a 
retry "won the lottery" to negotiate a connection).

Anyway - I hope that info is of some use to others in the future!"

Amazon Web Services' Reply to Teo En Ming
=========================================

Hello,

We approved your request for the removal of the EC2 email sending 
limitations on your Amazon Web Services account! If you requested 
removal of email sending limits on any other Amazon Elastic IPs, they've 
also been removed.

Because reverse DNS record entries are commonly considered in anti-spam 
filters, we recommend assigning a reverse DNS record to the Elastic IP 
address you use to send email to third parties. Please use the form 
located at this link to request a reverse DNS entry:
https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/html-forms-controller/contactus/ec2-email-limit-rdns-request

If you'd like to proceed with assigning a reverse DNS record to the 
Elastic IP, the first step would be to configure the A record for the 
domain to match the desired PTR record on your side.

Please follow the instructions at the link below to create the A record:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Regards,
Amazon Web Services
