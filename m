Subject: [PATCH 00/23] Floppy driver cleanups
Date:   Tue, 31 Mar 2020 11:40:31 +0200

This series applies a second batch of cleanups to the floppy driver and
its multiple arch-specific parts. Here the focus was on getting rid of
hard-coded registers and flags values to switch to their symbolic
definitions instead, and on making use of the global current_fdc variable
much more explicit throughout the code to reduce the risk of accidental
misuse as was the case with the most recently fixed bug.

Note that this code base is very old and the purpose is not to rewrite
nor reorganize the driver at all, but instead to make certain things
more obvious while keeping changes reviewable. It does not even address
style issues that make checkpatch continue to complain a little bit (15
total warnings which were already there and don't seem worth addressing
without more careful testing). Some comments were added to document a
few non-obvious assumptions though.

This series was rediffed against today's master (458ef2a25e0c) which
contains the first series. The changes were tested on x86 with real
hardware, and was build-tested on ARM.

Willy Tarreau (23):
  floppy: split the base port from the register in I/O accesses
  floppy: add references to 82077's extra registers
  floppy: use symbolic register names in the m68k port
  floppy: use symbolic register names in the parisc port
  floppy: use symbolic register names in the powerpc port
  floppy: use symbolic register names in the sparc32 port
  floppy: use symbolic register names in the sparc64 port
  floppy: use symbolic register names in the x86 port

    anymore
