Looking at the log, it looks like THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK was selected before the 
bc0ee4760364. So it should be fine to backport for all the Linux tree contain 
this commit.

I have tested the patch and can confirm that double-free disappeared after the 
patch is applied:

See below for a few comments.

It would be good to explain in the commit message why tweaking "dst" in 
arch_dup_task_struct() is fine.

 From my understanding, Arm64 used to have thread_info on the stack. So it would 
not be possible to clear TIF_SVE until the stack is initialized.

Now that the thread_info is part of the task, it should be valid to modify the 
flag from arch_dup_task_struct().

Note that technically, TIF_SVE does not need to be cleared from 
arch_dup_task_struct(). It could also be done from copy_thread(). But it is 
easier to keep the both changes together.

You may want to add a comment on top explaining why TIF_SVE is cleared here.
