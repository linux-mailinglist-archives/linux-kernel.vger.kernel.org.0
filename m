I believe DT was an attempt to move to declarative approach for
describing hardware. Yes, we have different compatibles for different
devices but they're specific to particular device rather than
particular board. Device interconnection is described in DT along with
some properties rather than in board-specific C-file. Introducing
board-specific compatible for a connector isn't looking right to me.

Sorry, I fail to see how it would be different from using existing
panels infrastructure and different panels compatibles. I think Rob's
idea was to introduce generic edp-connector. If we can't make it
generic then let's use panel infrastructure.

It isn't orthogonal to original problem though.
