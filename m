It will not: boot is now halted because systemd wants some
entropy. Everything is idle and very little interrupts are
happening. We have spinning rust, but it is idle, and thus not
generating any interrupts.

I'm not suggesting the notifier would invent some entropy... I agree
that kernel doing IO is strange, but I'm suggesting just that: if
userspace is blocked waiting for entropy, do some I/O, and let
interrupt randomness do its job.

It will work great on spinning rust. It will also work somehow on SSDs
and SD cards etc, because they have separate CPUs these days. They'll
certainly generate some interrupts, and we already assign some
randomness to that... It will let the machine boot, and entropy
calculation rules do not need to change.
