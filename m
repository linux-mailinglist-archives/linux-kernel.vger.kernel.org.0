I've tried to take a look into the source code. And it was not easy
try. :) I expected to have the bird-fly understanding from shardmap.h
file. My expectation was to find the initial set of structure
declarations with the good comments. But, frankly speaking, it's very
complicated path for the concept understanding. Even from C++ point of
view, the class declarations look very complicated if there are mixing
of fields with methods declarations. It's tough to read such
implementation.

So, I believe it makes sense to declare the necessary set of structures
in the file's beginning with the good comments. Even it will be good to
split the structure declarations and methods in different files. I
believe it will ease the way to understand the concept. Otherwise, it
will be tough to review such code.

Thanks,
Viacheslav Dubeyko.
