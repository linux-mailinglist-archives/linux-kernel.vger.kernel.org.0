When we enter into fadump crash path via system reset we fail to update
the pstore.

On the system reset path we first update the pstore then we go for fadump
crash. But the problem here is when all the CPUs try to get the pstore
lock to initiate the pstore write, only one CPUs will acquire the lock
and proceed with the pstore write. Since it in NMI context CPUs that fail
to get lock do not wait for their turn to write to the pstore and simply
proceed with the next operation which is fadump crash. One of the CPU who
proceeded with fadump crash path triggers the crash and does not wait for
the CPU who gets the pstore lock to complete the pstore update.

Timeline diagram to depicts the sequence of events that leads to an
unsuccessful pstore update when we hit fadump crash path via system reset.

            Race: crash triggered before pstore
                  update completes

To avoid the race between the CPU who proceeds with the pstore and the CPU
who triggers the crash, a delay of 500 milliseconds is added on fadump
crash path to allow pstore update to complete before we trigger the crash.

Changelog:

v1 -> v2
  - crash delay has been increased to 500 milliseconds
  - race happens in NMI context so updated the commit
    message to convey the same.
