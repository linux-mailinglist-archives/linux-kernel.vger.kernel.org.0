To me, this reads like your counter argument to not using regmap, is
to reinvent regmap.  Maybe I don't understand what you are proposing
here, but it sounds like remove the regmap support, define sn65
specific accessors that just before sending the write to the bus does
a check if the access needs to go over i2c or DSI.  Feels like a
clunky version of regmap to me.  Why not use the existing "generic"
framework?

To your point that DSI defines over 30 message types, yes it does, but
that seems to be outside of the scope.  How many of those are actually
for doing register access?  I'm thinking just 4 (technically a hair
more than that because of the multiple version of the same message) -
generic read, generic write, dcs read, dcs write.  I don't view regmap
as a generic abstraction layer over a particular mechanism, and thus
needs to support everything that mechanism does.  Sending sync
commands, or pixel data over DSI is outside the scope of regmap to me.
