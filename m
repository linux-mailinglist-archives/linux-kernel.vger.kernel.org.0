The CoreSight decoder needs the same information. When a branch / call
instruction is traced an atom is generated in the trace to determine
if that call as taken or not.
During the decode process the decoder walks the code image to match up
atoms to call / branch instructions - which means for correct trace
decode we must have an accurate code image as executed, as otherwise
trace decode will go wrong.
Within perf, the OpenCSD decoder will call back into perf to ask for
the memory image for a given address - which perf will supply from the
list of .so / executable files it has in the .debug directory.

Self modifying code presents an issue in this respect.

Correlation of the modification information with the captured trace
becomes the primary concern.

Mike
