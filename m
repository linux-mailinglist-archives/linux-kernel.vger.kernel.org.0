Thinking about it again, it looks like there is a difference in
creating a property and attaching a property. I'm wondering if drm
would let me (unconditionally) create a property before registering,
and attach it in late_register() only in case a privacy screen is
detected. (If not present, I can destroy the property in
late_register()). If this approach sound more promising, I can try it
out.

I propose that we:

1) Maintain a display_index[] array within the drm_dev, and increment
as connectors are added.
2) Initialize connector->acpi_device_id and and connector->acpi_handle
while registering (one time per connector).
3) Remove the code to update acpi_device_id on every resume.

It doesn't look like anyone on the DP MST side has cared for ACPI so
far, so I doubt if we can do anything that might break MST currently.
In other words, the above should not make things any worse for MST, if
not better. For connectors other than MST, this should allow them to
get ACPI handle and play with it, if they need.

WDYT?

Thanks,

Rajat
