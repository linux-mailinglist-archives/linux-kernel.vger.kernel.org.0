Please do let us know if this can be done in tooling.

I am not opposed to the approach taken in your v2 patch as it essentially
uses the hugepages_supported() functionality that exists today.  However,
it seems that other distros have ways around this issue.  As such, I would
prefer if the issue was addressed in the tooling.
