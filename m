Partial re-review. Please ignore the comment about multiple ACPI walks
in my previous review. Most of the other comments hold (like partial
/proc/iomem output *must* be included).

One remark I forgot is that this the v3 of your patch. Please version
your patches properly and provide the full changelog in v4. There is no
documentation what happend between v2 and v3.

Please provide more verbose explanation what the patch does. "Using it"
does not tell at all *what* is used and *how*. Please introduce the new
data structures and explain how they are used and what they replace and
so forth (you probably get the idea).

The commit message is definitely the weakest link of this patch right
now.

I think that you might get away just by collecting acpi_resources and
pass that to your helpers. See the documentation of the function on
how to make it collect all the resources:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/acpi/resource.c#L622

Of course you then have to move acpi_dev_free_resource_list() to be
called after you've done ioremaps.

This was the essential thing that I wanted to remark compared to my
previous review.
