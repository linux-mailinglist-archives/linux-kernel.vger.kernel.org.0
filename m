TBH, I'm big(ish) "functional no-op" changes like this are not things I
get super exicted about, especially for SoCs that have been working well
for awhile, and are do not have a large (upstream) userbase.

OTOH, since Martin is doing most of the heavy lifting for keeping this
platform working upstream, I'm happy to take the changes, as long as
Martin is willing to deal with any fallout.
