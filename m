Its been a long discussion on LKML, and the Source Available environment in=
 general. Much critisism of Stallman, and much critisism of lack of behavio=
ural limits.

And technically, things such as 1000hz timers have been much criticised, an=
d I found a 10ms filter in sched.c myself, being absurd as jitter is below =
200uS on a good config, and that has long ago happened with a 10ms(!) filte=
r.

It has been talk about "ricers", who config their kernel with unnecessary o=
ptions, yet defer-pop is enabled in the standard config. (rather ofcourse -=
fno-defer-pop)

And while talk about gods is supposedly not wanted, GNU is an "atheist" ver=
sion of god, that requires no money.

An O.S. fits perfectly to replace false deities, with an economic model. Th=
at is mostly what they became in history.

And ofcourse any acceptable paradigm of reality, to reality itself, should =
be supported.

DS-X O.S. supports all this, and inner loop optimization to the point of a =
looping selfmodfyng JSR (with arguments if CPU supports it).

And could be the ultimate cultural economic model, supporting all good 68er=
 politics up to now. (And replaces cannabis with cider, and el-mopeds, inli=
ne with the same philosophy really.)

(And weekendly pilgrimages to the club is not touched.)

Ready for Society V2? Which means money to developers?

Support and develop for DS-X OS, a direct streaming Unix-Derivative.
