Agreed!

I am not really sure I agree here though. Swappiness has been
traditionally more about workload because it has been believed that it
is a preference of the workload whether the anonymous or disk based
memory is more important. Whether this is a good interface is debatable
of course but time has shown that it is extremely hard to tune.

Not to mention that swappiness has been ignored for years for vast
majority workloads because of the highly biased file LRU reclaim.

At the time when cgroup v2 was introduced it'd been claimed that we
do not want to copy the v1 swappiness logic because of the semantic
shortcomings and that a better tuning should developed in future
replacing even the global knob. AFAIR Johannes wanted to have a refault
vs. cost based file/anon balancing.

The lack of a sensible hierarchical behavior has been even a stronger
argument.
