Anyway, I think the benefit of converting that function to C is pretty 
small. flush_dcache_range() and friends were converted to C mainly in 
order to inline them. But this __flush_dcache_icache_phys() is too big 
to be worth inlining, yet small and stable enough to remain in assembly 
for the time being.

So I suggest you keep it aside your series for now, just move 
PURGE_PREFETCHED_INS inside it directly as it will be the only remaining 
user of it.
