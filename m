Hi,

The series is

Tested-by: Sebastian Reichel <sebastian.reichel@collabora.com>

on 3800X.

idle:

k10temp-pci-00c3
Adapter: PCI adapter
Vcore:       919.00 mV
Vsoc:          1.01 V
Tdie:         +41.1=B0C
Tctl:         +41.1=B0C
Tccd1:        +39.8=B0C
Icore:         0.00 A
Isoc:          4.50 A

with load:

k10temp-pci-00c3
Adapter: PCI adapter
Vcore:         1.29 V
Vsoc:          1.01 V
Tdie:         +80.4=B0C
Tctl:         +80.4=B0C
Tccd1:        +78.5=B0C
Icore:        61.00 A
Isoc:          6.50 A

debugfs output is also register dumps are also working.
