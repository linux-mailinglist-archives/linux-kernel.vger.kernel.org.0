I assume these are better named hugetlb.<hugepagesize>.reservation.* 
rather than reservation_*, or perhaps shortened to resv.*, so for example 
hugetlb.<hugepagesize>.resv.limit_in_bytes.

Should probably be described after the page fault limits since those are 
the canonical limits that already exist and the "reservation_.*" 
equivalents are supplementary.

When saying that reservation limits are superior to page fault limits, it 
might be helpful to expand on the downsides of page fault limits.  The 
existing documentation calls out that the application needs to know its 
expected usage; it does not call attention to the fact that several 
different applications may be accessing an overcommited system-wide pool 
of hugetlb memory.  So it might be possible that the application 
understands its own usage but it may not understand how that is 
orchestrated with other applications on the same system accessing a shared 
pool of hugetlb pages.

But yes, I think MAP_FAILED and allow for fallback or freeing of hugetlb 
memory is far superior to SIGBUS :)

Discussion of reparenting?
