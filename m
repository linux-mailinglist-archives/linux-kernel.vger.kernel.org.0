"mem=" is a debug option, we ignore it if we need something located outside the 'mem=' region.

/dev/mem is an egregious hack! If you need to use it, you probably didn't want an
operating-system in the first place.

... What do you want to do this for?

At a guess: this is to save all that annoying 'memory allocation' overhead at guest
startup. If you get your VMM to use hugetlbfs, you can reserve the memory during boot. I
do this with "hugepagesz=2M hugepages=512" on the kernel command-line.

(if you get a RAS error affecting memory that the kernel doesn't know about, it will
ignore it. Using hugetlbfs instead gives you all the good things: hugepage-splitting,
signals to your VMM, stage2 unmapping etc.)


Thanks,

James
