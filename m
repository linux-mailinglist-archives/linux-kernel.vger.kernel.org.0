Hi Liu,

Thanks for fixing the documentation! As long as you're there...for the actual 
wording, can we please do it as shown below? This also addresses David's 
feedback, and it makes this read a lot better overall:

Patch ordering: I'll have to change the above as part of my upcoming series, to
make it refer to "put_page() or put_user_page(), depending on FOLL_PIN", 
approximately. (Just more of a note to self than anything else, here.)

thanks,
