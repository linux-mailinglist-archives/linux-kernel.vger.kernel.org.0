Well, we have had the infrastructure for fork_usermode_blob() in the kernel
since May 2018, though it is not really used so far (the bpfilter blob is
just reporting its existence, and not doing anything substantial). Probably,
significant parts of init/* could be migrated to such a blob. Would that be
an alternative generally preferred, or is its dependence on CC_CAN_LINK a
showstopper?

FWIW, non-initramfs boot code is considered to be "legacy" since 2.6.16, see
filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt:

| Today (2.6.16), initramfs is always compiled in, but not always used.  The

| smooth transition and allowing early boot functionality to gradually move to
| "early userspace" (I.E. initramfs).
|

That plan seems to have been obsoleted long ago, right?

Thanks,
