Subject: [PATCH 0/2] drm/sun4i: Fix sun8i HDMI PHY initialization

I received a report that 4K resolution doesn't work if U-Boot video
driver is disabled. It turns out that HDMI PHY clock driver was
initialized prematurely, before reset line was deasserted and clocks
enabled. U-Boot video driver masked the issue because it set pixel
clock correctly.

In the process of researching the bug, I also found out that few bits
in HDMI PHY registers were not set correctly. While there is no
noticeable change (4K resolution works with both settings), I've
added fix anyway, to be conformant with vendor documentation.

Please check it out.

Best regards,
Jernej
