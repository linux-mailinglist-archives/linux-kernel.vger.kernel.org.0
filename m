The above code does not get the results what we expected, it gets the reserved
memory marked as 'IORES_DESC_RESERVED' in the low 1MiB range.

Finally, kdump kernel happened the panic as follow:

I modified the above code, and tested it. This can find out the system ram in
the low 1MiB range. And it worked well.

If so, it can not find out the reserved memory marked as 'IORES_DESC_RESERVED' in
the low 1MiB range, finally, it doesn't pass the reserved memory in the low 1MiB to
kdump kernel, which could cause some problems, such as SME or PCI MMCONFIG issue.

I found three commits about 'IORES_DESC_RESERVED' flag, hope this helps.
1.ae9e13d621d6 ("x86/e820, ioport: Add a new I/O resource descriptor IORES_DESC_RESERVED")

I have tested the two changes that you mentioned, please refer to the reply above.
