Copying to registers invalids current fpregs context.  It might not cause
extra register loading, because registers are in fact already invalidated
and any task owning the context needs to reload anyway.  Setting
fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx is only to let the rest of the kernel know the
fact that already happened.

But, I agree with you the patch does look biggish.

Yes, that works for me.  Also, most of these call sites are under fpregs_lock(),
and we could use __cpu_invalidate_fpregs_state().

I was also thinking maybe add warnings when any new code re-introduces the issue,
but not sure where to add that.  Do you think that is needed?

Thanks,
Yu-cheng
