It's a regular Intel PC.

The ethernet is function 1 of the PCI device, function 0 isn't bound to any driver:
02:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Device [10ec:816e] (rev 1a)
02:00.1 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller [10ec:8168] (rev 22)
