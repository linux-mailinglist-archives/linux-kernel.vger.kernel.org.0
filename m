You should be able to read the instruction, run it through analyse_instr(), and then use OP_IS_LOAD_STORE() and GETSIZE() to understand the access range. This can be used to then perform a better match against what the user asked for.

Ok. Let me see how feasible that is.

But patch 1 and 3 are independent of this and can still go in. mpe?
