Yes, hsdev->usage, aka usage_id define the types between 0x00 and 0xFF.
For accessing a paritcualre fileds, we use attr_usage_id, between
0x100 and 0x7FF.
AFAIK, a sensorhub/collection can not contain to sensor of the same type.

In the legacy case, the location is hard-coded from sensor_num, the
index used by the EC: sensor 0 is in base, 1 is in the lid.
This limitation is removed from newer EC implementation, the EC
subcommand MOTIONSENSE_CMD_INFO provide that information.

No, it is assigned by the EC.
