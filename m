Great, hopefully it will make it easier to implement.

Yes, that's my current interpretation.

As far as I understand this, the page table tree isn't any different
here. It's just that there's a PMD which is allocated at the same time
as the PGD. The PGD's first entry then points to the PMD (P4D/PUD are
folded). There are then some tricks which means that for addresses < 4GB
the PGD stage can be skipped because you already know where the relevant
PMD is.

However, nothing should stop a simple walk from PGD down - it's just an
optimisation to remove the pointer fetch from PGD in the usual case for
accesses < 4GB.

The only case where p?d_bad() is checked is at the PGD and P4D levels
(unless I'm missing something?). I have to admit I'm a little unsure
about this. Basically the code as it stands doesn't allow leaf entries
at PGD or P4D. I'm not aware of any architectures that do this though.

Thanks,

Steve
