memmap_init_zone() is called when onlining memory. There, set all pages=20
to reserved right now (on context =3D=3D MEMMAP_HOTPLUG). We clear=20
PG_reserved when onlining a page to the buddy (e.g.,=20
generic_online_page). If we would online a memory block with holes, we=20
would want to keep all such pages (!pfn_valid()) set to reserved. Also,=20
there might be other side effects.

So it might not be that easy to remove. A cleanup that I have on my list=20
is to disallow offlining memory blocks with holes. This implies that we=20
will never online memory blocks with holes. This allows for some=20
cleanups in the onlining/offlining code. For example, it would allow to=20
get rid of this PG_reserved initialization.

I don't think that we have to support offlining memory blocks with=20
holes. This can only be bootmem (never hotplugged memory), where the=20
chance for this to work is in my opinion already not too good.

What's your opinion on this?

Right, I'll convert that comment

"Mark all sections offline and remove all free pages from the buddy."

Thanks!
