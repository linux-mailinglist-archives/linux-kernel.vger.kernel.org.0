I wonder how hard it should be to make a zero-filling GCC plugin?
I'm not a big fan of hacking GCC, but it shouldn't differ much from
the existing GCC plugins that initialize locals.

I've some stale data collected on an x86 QEMU instance.
For 0x00 stack initialization:
 - hackbench, netperf and parallel Linux build were virtually free
(slowdown within stdev)
 - for af_inet_loopback the slowdown was ~4%
For 0xAA stack initialization:
 - netperf and parallel Linux build were free
 - for hackbench the slowdown was ~1.5%
 - for af_inet_loopback the slowdown was ~7%

Since then we've made some improvements to Clang (and more are coming,
e.g. cross-function DSE in https://reviews.llvm.org/D61879), so I
expect the performance numbers to be better now.
A big chunk of slowdown had been caused by DSE not working well with
inline assembly on x86, need to check what's the current status there.

Lately I've been mostly benchmarking Android system performance using
the hwuimacro benchmark suite (an end-to-end benchmark for various UI
features).
Most of the benchmarks are unaffected by stack initialization, however
there are cases in which the slowdown is up to 5% for no obvious
reason (the hottest functions don't have initialization code in them,
slowdown could be related to increased icache pressure).

The biggest problem is that there's no single slowdown number to report.
Benchmarks like netperf may show big slowdowns, but many systems don't
run under netperf-like load 24/7
For graphical apps it's critical that the user doesn't notice the UI
glitches introduced by the instrumentation, so benchmarks exploiting
the full graphical stack are a lot more interesting.
Those often have big variance though, and are very specific to the
particular system.
