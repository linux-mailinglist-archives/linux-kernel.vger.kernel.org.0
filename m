Ok, I think I get it now. I see that your first patch actually wraps
all the places
where min_vruntime is accessed. So yes, the tree vruntime updation is needed
only one time. From then on, since we use the wrapper cfs_rq_min_vruntime(),
both the runqueues would self adjust from then on based on the code wide
min_vruntime. Also by the virtue that min_vruntime stays min from there on, the
tree updation logic will not be called more than once. So I think the
changes are safe.
I will do some profiling to make sure that it is actually called once only.

Yeah, I noticed this. In my patch, I had already accounted for this and changed
to min() instead of max() which is more logical that min_vruntime should be the
minimum of both the run queue.

Understood. The only reason I did the normalize is to get both the runqueues
under one min_vruntime always. And as long as we use the cfs_rq_min_vruntime
from then on, we wouldn't be calling the balancing logic any more.

Sure, thanks for the clarification.

Thanks,
