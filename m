Yes, to be precise, file writes were not completed and fs was stuck.
The system as a whole would probably become unbootable if this would
happen to core libraries necessary for systemd, or something like that,
but filesystem itself was not corrupted.

Re-writing the files was enough to recover the system.

I guess we'll see if there will be more reports after 5.6 is released,
or if it's just some quirk in my system.

I'll try to collect more information, once I'll have some time, to
get to the bottom of this.

thank you and regards,
