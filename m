Without ALLOW_WRITE+ALLOW_EXEC, the enclave would build and launch, but
fail at mprotect(..., PROT_WRITE), e.g. when it attempted to gain write
access to do self-modifying code.  And it would would fail irrespective of
LSM restrictions.

Unnecessary in an ideal world, yes.  Realistically, it's the least bad
option.

As above, mprotect(..., PROT_WRITE) would fail without ALLOW_WRITE.

No, the flags are tracked and managed by SGX.  We are not dictating LSM
behavior in any way, e.g. an LSM could completely ignore @allowed_prot and
nothing would break.

Code duplication is the least of my concerns.  Tracking file pointers
would require a global list/tree of some form, along with a locking and/or
RCU scheme to protect accesses to that container.  Another lock would be
needed to prevent races between mprotect() calls from different processes.

> But spilling them into user mode is what I think is unacceptable.

Why is it unacceptable?  There's effectively no cost to userspace for SGX1.
The ALLOW_* flags only come into play in the event of a noexec or LSM
restriction, i.e. worst case scenario an enclave that wants to do arbitrary
self-modifying code can declare RWX on everything.
