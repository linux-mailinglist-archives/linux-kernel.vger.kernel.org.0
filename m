Because it is a pain to read, just spell it out and make it obvious what
is happening.  You write code for developers first, and the compiler
second, and in this case, either way is identical to the compiler.

FW_BUG?

Anyway, if you make this change, how many machines start reporting this
error?  You should also say something like "default node of 0 now
selected" or something like that, right?
