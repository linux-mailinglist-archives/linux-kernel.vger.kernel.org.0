> Why do we need that though? Why is it advantageous for a backend to go to closed. No PV backends cope with an unbind as-is, and a toolstack initiated unplug will always set state to 5 anyway. So TBH any state transition done directly in the xenbus code looks wrong to me anyway (but appears to be a necessary evil to keep the toolstack working in the event it spawns a backend where there is actually to driver present, or it doesn't come online).

IMO the normal flow for unbind would be to attempt to close open
connections and then remove the driver: leaving frontends connected
without any attached backends is not correct, and will just block the
guest frontend until requests start timing out.

I can see the reasoning for doing that for the purpose of updating a
blkback module without guests noticing, but I would prefer that
leaving connections open was an option that could be given when
unbinding (or maybe a driver option in sysfs?), so that the default
behaviour would be to try to close everything when unbinding if
possible.

Thanks, Roger.
