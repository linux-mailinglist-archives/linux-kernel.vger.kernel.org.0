Huh?

This works today, but not for modules.

It is because the cover letter mentions it and downstream work around it.

Somewhere, either in each subsystem or in the DT or core code creating
struct devices, you need to iterate thru the dependencies. Take clocks
as an example:

for each node:
  for each 'clocks' phandle
    Lookup struct device from clock phandle
    Add the clock provider struct device to node's struct device links

Now, repeat this for regulators, interrupts, etc.

This series is pretty much doing the same thing, you just have to
parse each provider rather than only 'depends-on'.

One issue is the struct device for the dependency may not be created
yet. I think this series would have the same issue, but haven't dug
into how it avoids that or whether it just ignores it and falls back
to deferring probe.

I'm also not clear on how you create struct devices and add
dependencies before probing gets attempted. If a driver is already
registered, probe is going to be attempted before any dependencies are
added. I guess the issue is avoided with drivers being modules, but
any solution should work for built-in too.
