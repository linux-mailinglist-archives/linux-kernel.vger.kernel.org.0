ARGGH, brain hurt. I'm not sure I fully understand this one. How is it
different from today, where the NMI can hit in the middle of the TLB
invalidation?

Also; since we're not waiting on the IPI, what prevents us from freeing
the user pages before the remote CPU is 'done' with them? Currently the
synchronous IPI is like a sync point where we *know* the remote CPU is
completely done accessing the page.

Where getting an IPI stops speculation, speculation again restarts
inside the interrupt handler, and until we've passed the INVLPG/MOV CR3,
speculation can happen on that TLB entry, even though we've already
freed and re-used the user-page.

Also, what happens if the TLB invalidation IPI is stuck behind another
smp_function_call IPI that is doing user-access?

As said,.. brain hurts.
