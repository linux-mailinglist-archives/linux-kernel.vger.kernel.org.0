Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events s390: Fix commas so PMU event files are valid JSON
Date:   Thu, 12 Dec 2019 14:14:22 +0000
Message-Id: <20191212141422.72187-1-emaste@freefall.freebsd.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.22.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Ed Maste <emaste@freebsd.org>

No functional change.

Akin to da3ef7f6 for power9, remove extra commas in the s390 JSON files
so that the files can be parsed and validated by other utilities.
