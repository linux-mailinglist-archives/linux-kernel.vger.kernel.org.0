Hi Peter,
I'll try helping out by giving the entire patchset a try.

But in the meantime, if the plan of record will be to always allow
retrying then shouldn't the block I mailed a patch on be removed
regardless because do_user_addr_fault always starts with
FAULT_FLAG_ALLOW_RETRY and we shouldn't ever land there without it in
the future and allows userfaultfd to retry?

Thanks,
Brian
