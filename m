This one doesn't matter.  At this point the driver is single-threaded,
no interrupts, timeouts, or calls from the upper layer can happen.

This one only happens in run-to-completion mode.  Which is strange,
but a number of people had issues with getting into a new kernel before
the watchdog timeout went off, so the run-to-completion mode runs at
panic time so the driver can run without scheduling so it can extend
the watchdog and store panic information in the IPMI log.

So you actually *don't* want a lock here, since the panic may have
occurred when the IPMI driver was holding the lock.

It needs to be atomic, yes, but I think just adding the spinlock like
I suggested will work.  You are right, the check for timer_running is
not necessary here, and I'm fine with removing it, but there are other
issues with interrupt_disabled (as you said) and with memory ordering
in the timer case.  So even if you remove the timer running check, the
lock is still required here.

It also might be a good idea to add a WARN_ON() to smi_mod_timer() and
alloc_msg_handle_irq() if the lock is not held, just to be sure.
