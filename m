Good catch, Pierre.

Actually, not the best person to ask about "objective decisions" here as 
my vision is clouded by changes done internally. This code no longer 
exists in our internal repo. It's better for host to send MODULE_INFO 
request rather than understanding firmware binary structure and parse it 
directly.

I'm fine with solution #1 as I guess asking to wait for refactor is not 
an option. Code deployment is delayed due to range of administrative 
decisions, some of which should be uncovered on alsa-devel soon enough.
