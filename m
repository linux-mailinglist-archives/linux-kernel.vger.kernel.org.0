I'm waiting to hear how it is fatally flawed. But maybe this is just a
misunderstanding of the problem?

In the text below, I'm not sure if you mixing up two different things
or just that your wording it a bit ambiguous. So pardon my nitpick to
err on the side of clarity.

> A device can be added by a module that is loaded.

No, in the example I gave, of_platform_default_populate_init() would
add all 3 of those devices during arch_initcall_sync().

In that case, the _drivers_ for those devices aren't present at late
boot. So that they can't request to keep the resources on for their
consumer devices. Since there are no consumer requests on resources,
the suppliers turn off their resources at late boot (since there isn't
a better location as of today). The sync_state() call back added in a
subsequent patche in this series will provide the better location.

I think you are mixing up devices getting added/populated with drivers
getting loaded as modules?

I'll wait for more review replies?

Thanks,
