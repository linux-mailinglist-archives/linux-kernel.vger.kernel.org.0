Well, with that I mean multiple ranges with different offsets.  Take
a look at arch/mips/bmips/dma.c:__phys_to_dma() and friends.  This
is an existing implementation for mips, but there are arm and arm64
SOCs using the same logic on the market as well, and we'll want to
support them eventually.

And for the general case that is exactly the right thing to do, we
just need to deal with really odd ZONE_DMA placements like yours.

But that will cause yet another regression in what we have just fixed
with using the generic direct ops, at which points it turns into who
screams louder.

For now I'm tempted to throw something like this in, which is a bit
of a hack, but actually 100% matches what various architectures have
historically done:
