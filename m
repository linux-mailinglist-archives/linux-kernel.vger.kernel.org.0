My comments for 2/3 also apply here. Also, check out the
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst.

This is indeed very informative. I'd say it belongs more in a
Documentation/ than commit message. In a nutshell, we have uncore PMUs
that monitor integrated IO and the first task is to map those to the
actual devices in the system, right? A lot of the time commit messages
are way too short and missing important details, this one is tending
towards the other end of the spectrum.

At the same time, you don't seem to mention the one thing that this
patch does do: extend the uncore PMU to support integrated IO
monitoning, if my understanding is correct.

Also, the acronyms are unexplained. I'm not sure if they even need to be
here.

Most of the time, you don't need to verbalize the code in the commit
message, you can do it in the comments or Documentation. Here, we can
just scroll down for the implementation details. If you want to explain
the new callbacks, add comments to the structure definition.

So you need the attr_update to create the mapping attributes on the fly,
right? May be worth mentioning.

This can be more elaborate, like the "implementation details" paragraph
from the commit message.
