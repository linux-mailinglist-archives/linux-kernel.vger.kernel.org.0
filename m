Ok so after rebase it may be removed.=0A=

I have had a look on your patch and made some comments.=0A=
=0A=
Also, tested your patch "usb: dwc2: bus suspend/resume for hosts with =0A=
DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE" on HAPS-DX. With this patch or without it =0A=
when I have a device connected core  enters to partial power down and =0A=
doesn't exit from it. The attached device cannot be used.=0A=
