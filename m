You should likely have dropped Juergen RB, since you made some
non-trivial changes.

I think you should be the contact for this feature, you are the one
that implemented it :).

"When memory pressure is reported to blkback this option controls the
duration in milliseconds that blkback will not cache any page not
backed by a grant mapping. The default is 10ms."

I would place this in xenbus.c so that you don't need the
xen_blkbk_update_buffer_squeeze_end helper, and can just set
blkif->buffer_squeeze_end from xen_blkbk_reclaim_memory.

... and this comparison needs to use blkif->buffer_squeeze_end
