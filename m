Yes, at the crux of that matter was which regression introduced was more
important -- the one causing swap storms which Andrea is trying to address
or a latency issue due to assumptions of locality when MADV_HUGEPAGE
is used.

More people are affected by swap storms and distributions are carrying
out-of-tree patches to address it. Furthermore, multiple people unrelated
to each other can trivially reproduce the problem with test cases and
experience the problem with real workloads. Only you has a realistic
workload sensitive to the latency issue and we've asked repeatedly for
a test case (most recently Michal Hocko on May 4th) which is still not
available.

Currently the revert has to be carried out of tree for at least some
distributions which means any mainline users will have very different
experiences to distro users. Normally this is true anyway, but this is
an extreme example. The most important point is that the latency
problems are relatively difficult for a normal user to detect but a swap
storm is extremely easy to detect. We should be defaulting to the
behaviour that causes the least overall harm.

There are no solutions implemented although there are solutions possible --
however, forcing zone_reclaim_mode like behaviour when zone_reclaim_mode
is disabled makes the path forward hazardous.

Overall, I think it would be ok to have behaviour whereby local THP is
allocated if cheaply, followed by base pages local followed by the remote
options. However, __GFP_THISNODE removes the possibility of allowing
remote fallback and instead causing a swap storm and swap storms are
trivial to generate on NUMA machine running a mainline kernel today.

If a workload really prefers local huge pages even if that incurs
reclaim, it should be a deliberate choice.

Incurring swap storms when there is plenty of free memory available is
terrible. If the working set size is larger than a node, the swap storm
may even persist indefinitely.

Please share the workload in question so there is at least some chance
of developing a series that allocates locally (regardless of page size)
as much as possible without incurring swap storms.

The current behaviour is potential swap storms that are difficult to
avoid because the behaviour is hard-wired into the kernel internals.
Only disabling THP, either on a task or global basis, avoids it when
encountered.

The prctl should be the other way around -- use prctl if THP trumps all
else even if that means reclaiming a large amount of memory or swapping.

Please start by sharing the workload in question. However, I'm still
willing to bet that a swap storm causes significantly more harm for more
users than a latency penalty for a workload that is extremely latency
sensitive. The latency of a swap out/in is far more than a 13.9% access
latency.
