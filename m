Yes, your expectation is correct. As long as PMEM is a NUMA node, it
is treated as regular memory by memcg. But, I don't think memcg limit
reclaim should do migration since limit reclaim is used to reduce
memory usage, but migration doesn't reduce usage, it just moves memory
from one node to the other.

In my implementation, I just skip migration for memcg limit reclaim,
please see: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/1560468577-101178-7-git-send-email-yang.shi@linux.alibaba.com/

We did have some demands to control the ratio between DRAM and PMEM as
I mentioned in LSF/MM. Mel Gorman did suggest make memcg account DRAM
and PMEM respectively or something similar.

I recalled I had a hallway conversation with Keith about this in
LSF/MM. We all agree there should be not a cycle. But, IMHO, I don't
think exporting migration path to userspace (or letting user to define
migration path) and having multiple migration stops are good ideas in
general.
