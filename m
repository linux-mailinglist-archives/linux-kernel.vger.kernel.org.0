I'm certainly fine with the kernel allowing a mode like this.  At the
end of the day, anyone building something based on secure launch
should know what they're doing.

On the other hand, unless I've missed something, we need to support a
transition from "secure" measured mode to unmeasured and back if we're
going to support secure launch and S3 at the same time. But maybe S3
is on its way out in favor of suspend-to-idle?
