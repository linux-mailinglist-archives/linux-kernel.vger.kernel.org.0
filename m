You need an isync to guarantee all icbi insns before the isync have been
performed before any code after the isync is fetched.  Killing the
prefetch is just part of it.

This isn't very generic code.  The code seems to be trying to do
coherency in software.  Like you needed to do for DART on U3/U4, or for
some of the PMU/SMU communication -- both are through main memory, but
both are not cache coherent.  Which means all rules go out of the
window.

To do this properly you need some platform-specific code, for example
to kill hardware and software prefetch streams.  Or hope^Wguarantee
those never touch your communication buffers.


I recommend you keep the original function, maybe with a more specific
name, for the DART etc. code; and have all normal(*) dcbf users use a
new more normal function, with just a single sync instruction.

(*) As far as anything using dcbf can be called "normal"!
