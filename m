It's not totally trivially easy for me to test.  My previous failure
cases were leaving a few devices "idle" over a long period of time.  I
did that on 3 machines last night and didn't see any failures.  Thus
removing "WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE" may have made things better.  Before I say
for sure I'd want to test for longer / redo the test a few times,
since I've seen the problem go away on its own before (just by
timing/luck) and then re-appear.

Do you have a theory about why removing WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE would help?

---

NOTE: in trying to reproduce problems more quickly I actually came up
with a better test case for the problem I was seeing.  I found that I
can reproduce my own problems much better with this test:

  dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/log/foo.txt bs=4M count=512&
  while true; do
    ectool version > /dev/null;
  done

It should be noted that "/var" is on encrypted stateful on my system
so throwing data at it stresses dm-crypt.  It should also be noted
that somehow "/var" also ends up traversing through a loopback device
(this becomes relevant below):


With the above test:

1. With a mainline kernel that has commit 37a186225a0c
("platform/chrome: cros_ec_spi: Transfer messages at high priority"):
I see failures.

2. With a mainline kernel that has commit 37a186225a0c plus removing
WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE in dm-crypt: I still see failures.

3. With a mainline kernel that has commit 37a186225a0c plus removing
high priority (but keeping CPU intensive) in dm-crypt: I still see
failures.

4. With a mainline kernel that has commit 37a186225a0c plus removing
high priority (but keeping CPU intensive) in dm-crypt plus removing
set_user_nice() in loop_prepare_queue(): I get a pass!

5. With a mainline kernel that has commit 37a186225a0c plus removing
set_user_nice() in loop_prepare_queue() plus leaving dm-crypt alone: I
see failures.

6. With a mainline kernel that has commit 37a186225a0c plus removing
set_user_nice() in loop_prepare_queue() plus removing WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE
in dm-crypt: I still see failures

7. With my new "cros_ec at realtime" series and no other patches, I get a pass!


tl;dr: High priority (even without CPU_INTENSIVE) definitely causes
interference with my high priority work starving it for > 8 ms, but
dm-crypt isn't unique here--loopback devices also have problems.
