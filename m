I don't understand why you'd want an explicit %p<something> to do what
%p does by itself - in fact, with the current vsnprintf implementation,
"%pe", ERR_PTR(-EFOO) would already do what you want (since after %p is
processed, all alphanumeric are skipped whether they were interpreted or
not). So we could "reserve" %pe perhaps in order to make the call sites
a little more readable, but no code change in vsnprintf.c would be
necessary.

Or did you mean %pe with the argument being an (int*), so one would do

  if (err < 0)
    pr_err("bad: %pe\n", &err);

Maybe I'd buy that one, though I don't think it's much worse to do

  if (err < 0)
    pr_err("bad: %p\n", ERR_PTR(err));

Also, the former has less type safety/type genericity than the latter;
if err happens to be a long (or s8 or s16) the former won't work while
the latter will.

Or perhaps you meant introduce a %d<something> extension? I still think
that's a bad idea, and I've in the meantime found another reason
(covering %d in particular): Netdevices can be given a name containing
exactly one occurrence of %d (or no % at all), and then the actual name
will be determined based on that pattern. These patterns are settable
from userspace. And everything of course breaks horribly if somebody set
a name to "bla%deth" and that got turned into "blaEPERMth".

Well, I think my patch as-is is simple enough, there's not much point
separating the few lines in vsnprintf() from the introduction of
errcode() (which, realistically, will never have other callers).

Yes, I have actually prepared a v3, was just waiting for additional
comments on my responses to the v2 review comments.
