This callback might race with 'xen_blkbk_probe()'.  The race could result in
__NULL dereferencing__, as 'xen_blkbk_probe()' sets '->blkif' after it links
'be' to the 'dev'.  Please _don't merge_ this patch now!

I will do more test and share results.  Meanwhile, if you have any opinion,
please let me know.
