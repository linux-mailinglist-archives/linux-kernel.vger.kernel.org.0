It's easy enough to change the wording, and will do so on the next revision.

However, it's not clear to me that there is consensus on if the present
set of macros is acceptable/preferred over definition of a set of ones
that accept an additional parameter.

At least from my perspective and as Schrempf Frieder has hinted at,
these macros are syntactic sugar and all result in equivalent C code.

Either should compile to the same run-time size and performance (assuming
reasonably that a construct like `true ? 0x0b : 0x03` is optimized out).

Adding an additional parameter, at least for me, wouldn't improve readability
of the code and is offset by the need to refactor four other files. Even
though it should be a simple/trivial refactor, I do not have any examples
of the four other manufacturers' chips to be able to confirm proper operation.

I'll prepare a reworded set of patches with the present macro structure.

If there is strong feeling for refactoring the macro set, please let me know.
