As I understand it the deep problem is that sometimes we have not
observed enough random activity early in boot.

The cheap solution appears to be copying a random seed from a previous
boot, and I think that will take care of many many cases, and has
already been implemented.  Which reduces this to a system first
boot issue.

So for first system boot can we take some special actions to make
it possible to see randomness sooner.  An unconditional filesystem check
of the filesystem perhaps.  Something that will initiate disk activity
or other hardware activity that will generate interrupts and allow
us to capture randomness.

For many systems we could even have the installer capture some random
data as a final stage of the installation, and use that to seed
randomness on the first boot.

Somewhere in installing the random seed we need to be careful about
people just copying disk images from one system to another, and a
replicated seed probably can not be considered very random.

My sense is that by copying a random seed from one boot to the next
and by initiating system activity to hurry along the process of
having enough randomness we can have systems where we can almost
always have good random numbers available.

And if we almost always have good random numbers available we won't
have to worry about people getting this wrong.

Am I wrong or can we just solve random number availablity is practically
all cases?
