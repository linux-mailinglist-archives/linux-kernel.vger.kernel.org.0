I believe the proposed solution in this patch series is just that. I am not
sure what the alternatives are. The alternative suggested was to reuse
pre-existing dt-bindings for dependency based probe re-ordering and resolution.

However, it seems we had no way to *really* check if these dependencies are
the real. So, a device may or may not actually depend on the other device for
probe / initialization when the dependency is mentioned in it's dt node. From
DT's point of view, there is no way to tell this ..

I don't know how this is handled in x86. With DT, I don't see how we can do
this unless DT dependencies are _really_ tied with runtime dependencies (The
cycles would have been apparent if that was the case.

Honestly, the "depends-on" property suggested here just piles on to the
existing state. So, it is somewhat doubling the exiting bindings. It says,
you must use depends-on property to define probe / initialization dependency.
The existing bindings like 'clock', 'interrupt', '*-supply' do not enforce
that right now, so you will have device nodes that have these bindings right
now but don't necessarily need them for successful probe for example.

I guess :)
