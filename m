I see what you are saying, but from *security* perspective, I don't
think I really care about the scenarios above, right ?
Because that would mean a user duplicated his *own* fd. Sure, things
won't work for him, but what do I care about that, as you rightly
said.
I'm only concerned about the security risk, where there is a
legitimate user and a malicious one. Because I can't isolate between
them, I want to be able to allow only one of them to run.
I don't care if one of them duplicates his own FD, right ?

Please tell me if my assumption here is correct or not, because this
has implications.

hehe
I tried to grep for it but I couldn't find any. Strange because I was
sure I saw this in some driver.
As I said, I don't really care about it. I will delete this to prevent
further errors.
