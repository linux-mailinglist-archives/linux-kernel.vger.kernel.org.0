Do we need WRITE_ONCE() here?
Both "n" and "id" are given as parameters and do not change.
The assigment must be done before "id" is set as nl->head_id.
The ordering is enforced by cmpxchg_release().

I have got very confused by this. cpu_relax() suggests that this
cycle is busy waiting until a particular node becomes valid.
My first though was that it must cause deadlock in NMI when
the interrupted code is supposed to make the node valid.

But it is the other way. The head is always valid when it is
added to the list. It might become invalid when another CPU
moves the head and the old one gets reused.

Anyway, I do not see any reason for cpu_relax() here.

Also the entire cycle would deserve a comment to avoid this mistake.
For example:

		/*
		 * bC: Read seq from current head. Repeat with new
		 * head when it has changed and the old one got reused.
		 */

Do we really need WRITE_ONCE() here? 
It is the same problem as with setting n->next_id above.

Please, move this comment above the nl->node() call. Both locations
makes sense. I just see it as an important note for the call and thus
is should be above. Also it will be better separated from the below
comments for the _release() barrier.

Sigh, I see this line one screen below the previous command thanks
to the extensive comments. Well, bF comment looks redundant.
