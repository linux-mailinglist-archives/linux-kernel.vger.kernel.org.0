Sounds like you're also writing code, in which case you should give
yourself credit with your own Co-developed-by: tag.

Not at all.  I picked a semi-arbitrary name that was similar to existing
TIF names, I'll defer to anyone with an opinion.

It's mostly paranoia, e.g. if sld_state==sld_off but the MSR bit was
misconfigured.  No objection if you want to omit the check.

There's a random newline removal in do_trap().  It's a good change in the
sense that it eliminates an extra newline, bad in the sense that it's
unrelated to the rest of the patch.
