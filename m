Coming back to the v4 discussion
https://lore.kernel.org/r/379d23e5-79a5-9d90-0fb6-125d9be85e99@arm.com

There is no API between pelt.c and other parts of the scheduler/kernel
so why should we keep an unnecessary parameter and wrapper functions?

There is also no abstraction, update_thermal_load_avg() in pelt.c even
carries '_thermal_' in its name.

So why not define this shift value '[sched_|pelt_]thermal_decay_shift'
there as well? It belongs to update_thermal_load_avg().

All call sites of update_thermal_load_avg() use 'rq_clock_task(rq) >>
sched_thermal_decay_shift' so I don't see the need to pass it in.

IMHO, preparing for eventual code changes (e.g. parsing different now
values) is not a good practice in the kernel. Keeping the code small and
tidy is.
