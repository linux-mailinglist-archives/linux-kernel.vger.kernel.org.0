nandbiterrs -i /dev/mtd<x> to validate it works!

I don't understand this story of bad block map. Are you comparing with
a vendor kernel?

If vendors invent new ways to handle MTD blocks it's sad but they will
never be compatible with mainline. It's a fact. However for an upstream
version, I don't get if there is any real issue? The location of the
BBM is not related to your controller driver but depends on the NAND
chip and as you say below we know provide three possible positions in
a block.

What you refer as the FTL is the equivalent of UBI in Linux, which
indeed offers to the user a linear logical view of all the valid blocks
while physically the data is spread across all the available
eraseblocks.

Which pins are you talking about? Are you missing a pinctrl driver?

This is not related to your NAND controller driver neither.
