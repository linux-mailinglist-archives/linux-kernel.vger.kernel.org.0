Haha... Neither confirm nor deny.

Yeah, this is currently what I'm having to do. It's painful because due
to the Go runtime model of a single OS netpoller thread, locking the OS
thread to the current goroutine blocks out the other goroutines doing
network I/O.

Would you be able to accept the patch from this thread with the
container API?

    fd =3D container_socket(int container_fd,
                          int domain, int type, int protocol);

I think that seems more coherent with the rest of the container world
than a follow up of https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/3/220 :

    int socketns(int namespace, int domain, int type, int protocol)


I could also put some up if required.
