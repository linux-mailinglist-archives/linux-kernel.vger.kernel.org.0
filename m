I don't think so because mmget is a pure atomic_inc. How can you serialize
that against a tlb flush that just does an atomic_read() on mm_users?

At the very least you will have to invent something new slower than
mmget that adds some serialization against the TLB flush code and the
common code would need to learn to use that. And the question is how
much faster that can be than switch_mm() that use_mm already invokes.

It doesn't need to block but it needs a smp_mb() on both sides.

i.e. after atomic_inc(&mm_users) you need a smp_mb() and a
test_and_clear_bit and conditional local tlb flush. In the TLB flush
code you need to set the bit, smp_mb() and then atomic_read(&mm_users).

As things are now (no new mmget_local_tlb_flush() call in common code)
the mmget has to happen regardless before use_mm() so there's a slight
chance to serialize it in switch_mm arch code. Note I did put a
smp_mb() myself in the switch_mm path to make it safe in 2/2.

With your solution it'd be already possible to call mmput at any time
after using the mm and before calling unuse_mm. But then you'd have to
still call unuse_mm; mmget;use_mm again before you can use the mm
again so why not to call unuse_mm immediately instead of only mmput?

Almost all use_mm already do mmget before use_mm and mmput after
unuse_mm, or perhaps I wouldn't have to find about this by source
review only. So the cons you describe already affects the vast
majority of use_mm cases (the non buggy ones).

I see you concern for adding a "cons" to the minority of remaining
cases, but it's still better to introduce that "cons" than corrupting
userland memory.

Thanks,
Andrea
