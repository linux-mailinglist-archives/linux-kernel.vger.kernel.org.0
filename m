Indeed, it was biting us randomly, and it took me awhile to understand
the root cause.

I will send the full test shortly. Note, I was never able to reproduce
it in QEMU, only on real hardware. Also, for some unknown reason after
kexec I could not reproduce it only during first boot, so it is
somewhat fragile, but I am sure it can be reproduced in other cases as
well, it is just my reproducer is not tunes for that.

Correct.

I will shortly.

Less than a second on 8 CPU SoC it takes for a process to get access
to address space of another process.

I agree, and I actually have a patch for that, but I wanted my fix to
be included into 5.4 if possible. This is why I sent it out. I will
send out a C wrapper patch soon, but that one won't need to be
backported to stable.
