Makes sense now, thanks.

I am not sure if this will fix all cases though?

I think the crux of the problem is doing a recursive wake up. The threaded
IRQ probably just happens to be causing it here, it seems to me this problem
can also occur on a non-threaded irq system (say current_reader() in your
example executed in a scheduler path in process-context and not from an
interrupt). Is that not possible?

I think the fix should be to prevent the wake-up not based on whether we are
in hard/soft-interrupt mode but that we are doing the rcu_read_unlock() from
a scheduler path (if we can detect that)

I lost track of this code:
 		if ((exp || in_irq()) && irqs_were_disabled && use_softirq &&
 		    (in_irq() || !t->rcu_read_unlock_special.b.deferred_qs)) {

Was this patch posted to the list? I will blame it to try to get some
context. It sounds like you added more conditions on when to kick the
softirq.

/me needs to understand why the irq work stuff was added here as well. Have
my work cut out for the day! ;-)
