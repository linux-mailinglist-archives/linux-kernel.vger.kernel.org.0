I didn't notice the "This is by design" here, referring to the memory
never being freed.  "This is by design" was suppose to refer to
requiring a custom policy for measuring keys.

For now, these two patches are queued in the next-integrity-testing
branch, but I would appreciate your addressing not freeing the memory
associated with the keys, if a custom policy is not loaded.

Please note that I truncated the 2/2 patch description, as it repeats
the existing verification example in commit ("2b60c0ecedf8 IMA: Read
keyrings= option from the IMA policy").

thanks,

Mimi
