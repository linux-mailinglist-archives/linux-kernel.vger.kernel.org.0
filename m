Hmm, I've failed to reproduce the issue with that config and either GCC
(7.1.1 and 8.3.0) or Clang (a flavour of 9.0.0 from a few months ago).

Ok, but the patch that appears to cause this problem doesn't change the
type of anything we're exporting. The symbol in your log is
"kernel_neon_begin" which is:

	void kernel_neon_begin(void);

so I'm still fairly confused about the problem. In fact, even if I create
a silly:

	void will_kernel_neon_begin(__uint128_t);

function, then somehow I see it being processed:

	__crc_will_kernel_neon_begin = 0x5401d250;

Is there some way that your passing '-w' to genksyms?
