Intel's SGX SDK *does* support simulation mode for debugging enclaves 
outside of SGX mode, or even on non-SGX platforms. But nothing can 
replace the real SGX environment, hence SGX ISA supports debugging real 
enclaves.

SDK supports simulation on non-SGX platforms.

That's true.

The new vDSO API is to support data exchange on stack. It has nothing to 
do with debugging. BTW, the community has closed on this.

The CFI directives are for stack unwinding. They don't affect what the 
code does so you can just treat them as NOPs if you don't understand 
what they do. However, they are useful to not only debuggers but also 
exception handling code. libunwind also has a setjmp()/longjmp() 
implementation based on CFI directives.
