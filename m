For FDT uses, it's pretty much been configuration. It's mostly been
for PCI that I've seen these properties used.

True, and I'd certainly agree when we're talking about some vendor
specific blob. but there's already code/tools to parse USB
descriptors.

Surely the descriptor building code can be shared at a minimum.

Regardless of whether gadget configfs fits, usually it is pretty clear
whether something belongs in DT or userspace. That should be decided
first.

If control of the hub is done by userspace, I'd think configuration
should be there too.
