Then reverting 458b7c8e0dde and applying this patch still resolves the issue 
for me.  No errors appear when mappings are unmapped on device close after the 
device has been removed, and domain info preserved on device removal is 
successfully reused on device re-plug.

Is there anything else I can do to help?

Janusz
