My understanding is that this is some sort of UUID.  Looking at
doc/install/manual-deployment.rst it says that the fsid is a unique ID
that should be generated using uuidgen (I believe that's what vstart.sh
clusters use).

That said, it's obviously possible to reuse an fsid in two clusters.
And mounting both filesystems with the same fsid on the same client may
already cause some troubles without even trying to copy_file_range files
across them (for ex., fscache code seems to assume unique fsids).  But I
have never tested such sort of things (probably no one did) and I really
don't know what are the consequences.  In this specific case, I would
expect the 'copy-from' operation to fail with some error from the OSDs.

If there are concerns regarding this, I'm OK simply dropping the patch
for now and continue forbidding object copies when superblocks are
different.  I just thought this was a low-hanging fruit, and didn't
realized that it's not very easy to ensure that 2 cephfs instances
actually belong to the same cluster.  Maybe there are other checks that
could be done...?
