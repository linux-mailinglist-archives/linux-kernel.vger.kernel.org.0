I am not sure that I fully understand the problem. seq_newest
wraps at 2^30 (32-bit) and at 2^62 (64-bit). It takes a while
to reuse an existing one. And it does not depend on the size
of the array.

In addition, new sequence number can get assigned only when
the descriptor with the conflicting (sharing the same struct
prb_desc) sequence number is in reusable state. It means
that it has to be committed before.

In my implementation, the sequence numbers are atomically reserved
in prb_reserve_desc() by

	} while (cmpxchg(&rb->seq_newest, seq_newest, seq) != newest_seqs);

where seq is always seq_newest + 1. We are here only when the
conflicting seq from the previous wrap is in reusable state
and the related datablock is moved outside valid lpos range.
This is ensured by prb_remove_desc_oldest(rb, seq_prev_wrap).

Now, the CPU that succeeded with cmpxchg() becomes
the exclusive owner of the respective descriptor. The sequence
number is written into this descriptor _after_ cmpxchg() succeeded.

It is safe because:

    + previous values are not longer used (descriptor has been marked
      as reusable, lpos from the related datablock were moved
      outside valid range (lpos_oldest, lpos_newest).

    + new values are ignored by readers and other writers until
      the right sequence number and the committed flag is set
      in the descriptor.

This is exactly what the code does, see prb_make_desc_unused().
It marks the descriptor as committed so that it can get reused.
And it sets lpos and lpos_next to the same value so that
the situation can get eventually detected by readers.

I am definitely interested into seeing v3 of your approach. I believe
that it will be much easier to understand. Then it will be easier to
compare.


BTW: There is one potential problem with my alternative approach.

     The descriptors and the related data blocks might get reserved
     in different order. Now, the descriptor might get reused only
     when the related datablock is moved outside the valid range.
     This operation might move also other data blocks outside
     the range and invalidate descriptors that were reserved later.
     As a result we might need to invalidate more messages in
     the log buffer then would be really necessary.

     If I get it properly, this problem does not exist with
     the implementation using links. It is because the descriptors
     are linked in the same order as the reserved data blocks.

     I am not sure how big the problem, with more invalidated messages,
     would be in reality. I am not sure if it would be worth
     a more complicated implementation.

     Alternative solution would be to somehow mix tricks from
     both approaches and get something that is easier to deal
     with and has less drawbacks. I am not sure it is possible.
     Anyway, I still need to fully understand the linked approach
     first.

Petr
