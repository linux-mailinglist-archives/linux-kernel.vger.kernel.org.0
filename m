The tools are working as expected, we normally don't take patches
directly to arm@kernel.org, we let them go in through platform
maintainers who then send it on to us.

Those views are how the "board file hell" started on 32-bit ARM too,
so we're definitely hesitant to jump to that conclusion without
knowing more about what's actually anticipated.


Do you happen to have an estimate on what kind of drivers are
