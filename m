There's 2 teams from Microsoft trying to do this [1]. We tested the previous
implementation (which problems on probing as built-in). We had to change some
stuff in the OP-TEE fTPM implementation [2] and test it in QEMU.

What i quickly did with this module was to replace the kernel of the previous
build with the new one. Unfortunately i couldn't get it to work, but i don't
know if it's the module or the changes in the fTPM OP-TEE part. Since you have
tested it my guess is that it has something to do with the OP-TEE part. I don't
have any objections in this going in. On the contrary i think the functionality
is really useful. I don't have hardware to test this at the moment, but once i
get it, i'll give it a spin.

The part i tested is that the probing works as expected when no fTPM
implementation is running on secure world.
Since it has been tested and doesn't break anything we can always fix corner,
cases afterwards with more extensive testing
