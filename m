This madvise syscall just operates on pidfds. It would make sense to
name it process_madvise() if were to operate both on pid_t and int pidfd.
Giving specific names to system calls won't stop it from becoming
normalized. The fact that people built other system calls around it
is enough proof of that. :)
For userspace pidfd_madvise is nicer and it clearly expresses
that it only accepts pidfds.
So please, Minchan make it pidfd_madvise() in the next version. :)
