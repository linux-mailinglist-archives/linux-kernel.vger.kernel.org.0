Is a subclass of Meltdown, but cannot be mitigated in software and we don't
know whether the micro-code contains a fix or not unless the CPU/microcode
tells us that Meltdown is fixed, which includes 3a. We report that
correctly.

It's also not a really spectacular issue. The only valuable data you might
get out of it is info to break KASLR, but there are a gazillion other ways
to do so.

The kernel is not using lazy restore. Dead kernels did, but they got
patched and no longer allow the lazy mode. So, nothing to see here.

Is a subclass of Spectre V1 similar to the recently published SWAPGS issue.

Spoiler cannot be mitigated by any means. It's like Rowhammer. Nothing we
can do about and nothing to show.

What? Spectre V1, V2 and Meltdown and SSB are different classes despite the
variant 1,2,3,4 enumeration. They are different classes because they
utilize different parts of the whole speculative execution machinery and
need very different mitigation mechanisms.

Just because Wikipedia has a list of some sort does not mean that we have
to blindly follow it.
