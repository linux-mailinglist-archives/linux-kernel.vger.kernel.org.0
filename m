Here is the corresponding U-Boot Patch
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1096087/

Currently, boot loader doesn't care about versioning. Since we are 
updating a reserved field, offsets will not change. If a boot loader 
want to use the versioning, it should be patched along with the kernel 
patch.

Any other boot loader that doesn't care about the version, it can 
continue to do so without any change.

My idea is to enable the minimum required fields in this patch and keep 
everything else as reserved so that it can be amended in future as required.

Atish
