Yeah, that was my fist thought too, but it doesn't help.

So with RPi4's DMA mapping:

soc {
	dma-ranges =3D <0xc0000000  0x0 0x00000000  0x3c000000>;
	[...]
};

You'll get a 32bit bus dma map (log2i(0xc0000000 + 0x3c000000) + 1 =3D 32).

Trouble is, taking into account arm's multi_v7_defconfig uses 32bit address=
es,
most phys_to_dma() translations are likely to overflow. For example phys
0x60000000 will be translated to DMA 0x20000000, which is no good.

No mask is going to catch this, and both dma_capable() implementations will
fail.

Noted, looks good to me.

Actually, an alternative to this patch would be to kill all custom
dma_capable() implementations, which are mostly redundant, and add these ex=
tra
checks conditional to the DMA address size in the generic version. I'll try=
 to
respin this if I manage to understand what's going on with x86/sta211-fixup=
.c.
