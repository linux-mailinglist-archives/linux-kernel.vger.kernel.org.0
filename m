Where is there a mention about drivers registering for cpu PM
notifications? I'm not aware of this being mentioned as a requirement.
Instead, my understanding is that deep idle states shouldn't affect irqs
from being raised to the CPU. If such an irq is enabled and can't wake
the system from deep idle and it's expected to interrupt during this
idle time then perhaps the PDC driver needs to block deep idle states
until that irq is disabled.

Does this scenario exist? It sounds like broken system design to have an
irq that can't wake from deep idle, but I see that PDC has a selective
set of pins so maybe some irqs just aren't expected to wake the system
up during idle.
