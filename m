You are correct. I was looking at a 4.14 kernel where it's called
mmc_sd_reset. 4.19 and above call it mmc_sd_hw_reset.

All I was trying to convey here was that a block error will eventually
call sdhci_set_ios with SOFT_RESET_ALL via:
mmc_blk_reset
mmc_hw_reset
mmc_sd_hw_reset
mmc_power_cycle
mmc_power_off
mmc_set_initial_state
sdhci_set_ios
sdhci_reinit
sdhci_init
sdhci_do_reset(host, SDHCI_RESET_ALL);

So in sdhci_do_reset we call the reset callback which is typically
sdhci_reset. sdhci_reset can wait for up to 100ms waiting for the
controller to reset. If SDHCI_RESET_ALL was passed as the flag, the
controller will clear the IRQ mask. If during that 100ms the card is
removed there is no notification to the MMC system that the card was
removed. So it seems like the card is always present.

mmc_detect_card_removed has the guard `host->detect_change` to
prevent it from checking the card status again. So maybe the fix to the
missing interrupt/race condition is to set `host->detect_change = 1`
from sdhci_do_reset after calling the reset handler. This way there will
always be a single poll after a full reset so the correct card status can
be detected?
