Yes, I think it's commit 8fcc3a580651 "ext4: rework reserved cluster
accounting when invalidating pages". Because that commit moved releasing of
reserved space from page invalidation time to extent status tree eviction
time. Does attached patch fix the problem for you?

In that case all data should be written out for such inode and thus there
should be no reserves...

Subject: [PATCH] ext4: Fix leak of quota reservations

Commit 8fcc3a580651 ("ext4: rework reserved cluster accounting when
invalidating pages") moved freeing of delayed allocation reservations
from dirty page invalidation time to time when we evict corresponding
status extent from extent status tree. For inodes which don't have any
blocks allocated this may actually happen only in ext4_clear_blocks()
which is after we've dropped references to quota structures from the
inode. Thus reservation of quota leaked. Fix the problem by clearing
quota information from the inode only after evicting extent status tree
in ext4_clear_inode().
