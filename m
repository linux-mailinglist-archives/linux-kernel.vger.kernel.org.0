BTW, I played a bit with 9380 and it looks like there is no option to
enable Preboot ACL which means that if you have TBT security enabled
(user or secure) the Dock PCIe side is not functional during boot, only
once the OS has booted up. That's fine unless you want to enter BIOS
menu from the keyboard you have connected to the TB16 dock (probably not
too common use case anyway).
