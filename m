Bah! I forgot that I did that. I even saw the tag I sent you last time
and that didn't even hit to me that I already sent these.

I do a short log on what I plan on sending and write up the change log
based on this.

I should have done a commit diff on your upstream tree and not just
base my pull request on where I started with your tree.

Yeah, do you want me to make a new message, where it doesn't repeat the
previous pull? It will still have the same sha1 head, as nothing should
have changed, as its based on the same commit as that last pull.
