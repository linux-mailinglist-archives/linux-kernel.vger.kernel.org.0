Rob pointed out (above) the dependencies that are already contained in
devicetree.  Those are real hardware descriptions that have to be
correct or the devices will not use the hardware that they "depend on"
(thus an incorrect hardware description _also_ results in the resource
that is not described not actually being a dependency).

If you add a second set of properties purely to list dependencies then
the second set of dependencies is likely to have latent errors that are
not initially detected (when the property is first introduced) because
the proper resources just happen to be available by sheer chance.  Then
a later change in boot order resulting from a code change or configuration
change can expose that latent error.

A second set of dependency properties is making boot more fragile.
