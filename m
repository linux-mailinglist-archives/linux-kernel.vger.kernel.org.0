I forgot to update the `dd` command.  I used the command for the slow block
device test, but directly induced the I/O towards the block device for the fast
block device test as below:

    # xl block-attach guest phy:/dev/ram0 xvdb w
 
    $ for i in {1..5}; do dd if=/dev/zero of=file \
                             bs=4k count=$((256*512)); sync; done

Nevertheless, I agree that you suggested test will provide much more accurate.
As stated before, my test is only designed for a minimal proof-of-concept.

I guess the grant page allocation overhead in this test scenario is really
small.  In an absence of memory pressure, fragmentation, and NUMA imbalance,
the latency of the page allocation ('get_page()') is very short, as it will
success in the fast path.

Few years ago, I once measured the page allocation latency on my machine.
Roughly speaking, it was about 1us in best case, 100us in worst case, and 5us
in average.  Please keep in mind that the measurement was not designed and
performed in serious way.  Thus the results could have profile overhead in it,
though.  While keeping that in mind, let's simply believe the number and ignore
the latency of the block layer, blkback itself (including the grant
mapping), and anything else including context switch, cache miss, but the
allocation.  In other words, suppose that the grant page allocation is only one
source of the overhead.  It will be able to achieve 1 million IOPS (4KB *
1MIOPS = 4 GB/s) in the best case, 200 thousand IOPS (800 MB/s) in average, and
10 thousand IOPS (40 MB/s) in worst case.  Based on this coarse calculation, I
think the test results is reasonable.

This also means that the effect of the blkback's free pages pool might be
visible under page allocation fast path failure situation.  Nevertheless, it
would be also hard to measure that in micro level unless the measurement is
well designed and controlled.

To be honest, I'm not sure whether additional tests are really necessary,
because I think the `dd` test and the results explanation already makes some
sense and provide the minimal proof of the concept.  Also, this change is a
fallback for the memory pressure situation, which is an error path in some
point of view.  Such errorneous situation might not happen frequently and if
the situation is not solved in short time, something much worse (e.g., OOM kill
of the user space xen control processes) than temporal I/O performance
degradation could happen.  Thus, I'm not sure whether such detailed performance
measurement is necessary for this rare error handling change.  The comment of
'xen_blkbk_unmap()' also says, "This could accumulate ops up to the batch size
to reduce the number of hypercalls, but since this is only used in error paths
there's no real need.".

That said, if you still want me to do the test, I will gladly do it.  Note that
since I'm now traveling US without the power cable of my now discharged laptop
which is the only way to connect to my test environments in my office, I would
not be able to do the additional test quickly.  I assume I could do the test
and give you the result within a couple of week.  If you want me to post next
version with minor changes such as commit message update meanwhile, please just
let me know.  Again, if you want it, I will gladly do it :)
