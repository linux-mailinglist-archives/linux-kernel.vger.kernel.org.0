I posted v3 of this patch 5 months ago, then after 0day bot found
an issue after the resend I send a v4 honestly believing that that
was the only issue with it.

0day bot found another issue, so I send out v5, checking what special
options similar code (EFI libstub) uses to make sure I cover all special
cases this time.

So I've send out 2 versions, not 5 not 10, but only 2 versions in
the past 2 days and you start complaining about me rushing this and
not fixing it properly, to me that does not come across positive.

More specifically my intentions / motives on this were well intended
and I too believe in fixing things the proper way. Your reply suggested
that I just want to rush this through, which calls my motives into
question, for which in my mind there was no reason.

If you complain about 2 versions in 2 days, or 5 versions over 5 months
then that feels exaggerated and it certainly does not give me a feeling
that the effort which I'm putting into this is being appreciated.

Anyways we have a plan how to move forward with this now, so lets
focus on that.

Ok, then lets move forward with this.
