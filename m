Yeah, I do the same too, except when I want to se the hole
picture or on complex subsystems. You can't really understand
media subsystems if you don't read it from the docs, as
the rationale for a lot of things are there.

Yet, for newcomers that are studying a new subsystem, a
good documentation helps a lot.

Yeah, me too.

Agreed, but, when writing text docs, doing something like:

	parameter
		parameter description

and getting the first line bolded helps to reduce the need of
adding explicit bold markups and produce a nice visual.

Thank you!
