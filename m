And I was wrong. I worried that the conflict with the load balancer would
be a problem when I wrote this comment.  That was based on finding that
I had to account for the load balancer when using capacity to decide
whether an idle CPU can be used. When I didn't, performance went to
hell but thought that maybe you had somehow avoided the same problem.
Unfortunately, testing indicates that the same, or similar, problem is
here.

This is specjbb running two JVMs on a 2-socket Haswell machine with 48
cores in total. This is just your first two patches, I have found that
the group classify patches do not recover it.

Note that how it reaches the point where the node is almost utilised
( near tput-12) that performance drops.  Graphing mpstat on a per-node
basis shows there is imbalance in the CPU utilisation between nodes.

NUMA locality is not bad, scanning and migrations are a bit higher but
overall this is a problem.

On a 4-socket machine, I see slightly different results -- there is still
a big drop although not a statistically significant one. However, the
per-node CPU utilisation is skewed as nodes approach being fully utilised.

I see similarly bad results on a 2-socket Broadwell machine.

I don't have other results yet for other workloads but I'm not optimistic
that I'll see anything different. I still think that this probably didn't
show up with hackbench because it's too short-lived for NUMA balancing
to be a factor.
