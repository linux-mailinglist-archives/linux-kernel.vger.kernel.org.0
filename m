That works fine for some devices, but for Toshiba NVMes this said scenario  
freezes the system, hence the new patch here.

And for all NVMes I tested this new suspend routine saves even more power  
than simply skipping suspend.

Ok, but we still need to figure out how to prevent the device device from  
tradition to D3.

Ok, I’ll check with vendors about this.
