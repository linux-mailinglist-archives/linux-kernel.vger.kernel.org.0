Yes, it validates as expected, like I wrote. Various sources told me that
json-schema is not always straightforward so I assumed anyOf was OK.

That validates, too. Looks better, admittedly. I don't have a strong
opinion here. It's just that Rob wrote in

(your points back then were port@N descriptions and neccessity for port@0)

Are you sure that "object" is specific enough?

You mean like

| jsonschema.exceptions.SchemaError: Additional properties are not allowed ('unevaluatedProperties' was unexpected)
[...]
| On schema:
|    {'$id': 'http://devicetree.org/schemas/watchdog/allwinner,sun4i-a10-wdt.yaml#',
[...]
|      'unevaluatedProperties': False}

? ;-)

But yes, this patch series passes even with additionalProperties: false.

In which form would you like to receive the update?
