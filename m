Thanks Mel,

I added such a check to should_continue_reclaim.  However, it does not
address the issue I am seeing.  In that do-while loop in shrink_node,
the scan priority is not raised (priority--).  We can enter the loop
with priority == DEF_PRIORITY and continue to loop for minutes as seen
in my previous debug output.
