Hi all,

As far as I understand there is a contradiction between having a "platonic"
implementation of locks (Ã  la lock.cat) and a concrete one (for ordinary locks
lock -> load acquire, unlock -> store release, + loop [difficult for herd]
or filter clause).

So if reader/writer locks are catified in a platonic way, we cannot
use various atomic primitives. Instead, we give them an abstract semantics
based upon some axiomatisation of their semantics, using cat means.
Such an axionatisation  does not seem straightforward because,
by constrast with locks, there is an integer count
hiddden, and not a simple boolean as for ordinary locks

Some idea would be first to partition reader crtical sections,
and then for each such partition, order elements of the partition and
writer critical section. For one such choice there are still many possible
rf relations...
