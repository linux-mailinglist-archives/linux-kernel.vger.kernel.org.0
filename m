Oops, I'm not sure how I did this by accident but the explanation I gave in
the commit message was uh, completely wrong. I must have forgotten that I made
sure we didn't expose connectors before probing their PBN back when I started
my MST cleanup....

So: despite what I said before it's not actually when new connectors are
created, it's when downstream hotplugs happen which means that the conenctor's
always going to be there before we probe the available_pbn. I did just notice
though that we send a hotplug on connection status notifications even before
we've finished the PBN probe, so I might be able to improve on that as well.
We still definitely want to report the connector as disconnected before we
have the available PBN though, in case another probe was already going before
we got the connection status notification.

I'll make sure to fixup the explanation in the commit message on the next
respin
