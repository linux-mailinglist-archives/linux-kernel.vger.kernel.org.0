Setting aside modules for one moment, why is there any auto disabling
of clocks and regulators in late initcall????  Deferred probe processing
does not begin until deferred_probe_initcall() sets
driver_deferred_probe_enable to true.  No late_initcall function
should ever depend on ordering with respect to any other late_initcall.
(And yes, I know that among various initcall levels, there have been
games played to get a certain amount of ordering, but that is at
best fragile.)

In addition to modules, devicetree overlays need to be considered.

Just as modules can result in a driver appearing after boot finishes,
overlays can result in new devicetree nodes (and thus dependencies)
appearing after boot finishes.
