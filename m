It's fine to add sysfs files (as long as you document them in
Documentation/ABI/) but don't do so file-by-file in a driver as that is
racy and will not work.  See 6d03c140db2e ("USB: phy: fsl-usb: convert
platform driver to use dev_groups") as an example of how to do this in a
simple way to have the driver core do all of the work for you
automatically.
