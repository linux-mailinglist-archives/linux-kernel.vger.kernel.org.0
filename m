Ick.  OK, so I guess technically the old bindings didn't specify
order.  It seems like it was implied that the required clocks should
come before the optional, but I guess it wasn't explicit...

Ugh, it gets even worse, at least for msm8996.  It looks like things
are nicely consistent for all the new ones.  They _all_ do:

  "cfg_noc", "core", "iface", "mock_utmi", "sleep";

...but msm8996 is a mess.  It looks to have two USB ports (usb2 and
usb3).  Both ports have exactly the same compatible string listed, AKA
"qcom,msm8996-dwc3", "qcom,dwc3".  ...but we don't seem to use
"clock-names" for either port and things seem jumbled.  Specifically:

* USB3 port: actually has 6 clocks listed instead of 5 (but, on the
plus side, the first 5 match everyone else in ordering).  The 6th
clock seems to be an extra PHY clock listed which seems wrong.

* USB2 port: has 5 clocks.  Missing "iface" but has the extra "PHY"
clock.  AKA listed order is: "cfg_noc", "core", "mock_utmi", "sleep",
extra PHY clock.


If I had to make a decision, I'd do this:

* For 8996, document exactly what's in the device tree.

* For everything except 8996, use the order that your current patch
has (AKA also document what's in device trees).

* Consider seeing if we can remove the "PHY" clock from the 8996
device tree.  If you can, make it optional (but deprecated) to supply
it.


Probably something like this (UNTESTED) would work.  Optionally you
could figure out how to be smarter and list 6 clocks for the PHY with
the node name "usb@6af8800" and 5 clocks for the PHY with the node
name "usb@76f8800", but I'm not sure it's worth it.

NOTE: looking at the current Linux driver, it is very simplistic and
just enables all listed clocks in bulk.  It never refers to clocks by
name.
