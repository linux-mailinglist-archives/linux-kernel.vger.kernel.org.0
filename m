The integrity subsystem, and other concepts upstreamed to support it,
are being used by different people/companies in different ways.  I
know some of the ways, but not all, as how it is being used.  For
example, Mat Martineau gave an LSS2019-NA talk titled "Using and
Implementing Keyring Restrictions for Userspace".  I don't know if he
would be interested in measuring keys on these restricted userspace
keyrings, but before we limit how a new feature works, we should at
least look to see if that limitation is really necessary.
