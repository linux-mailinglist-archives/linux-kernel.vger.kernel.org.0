Agreed; that can be an issue. But if so, that then needs to be stated.

Sure; and like I said, if you want to use READ_ONCE() I'm not going to
argue.

Shit happens :-)

Ideally every KCSAN report, but that is a longer term effort. But
specifically, when someone has written a patch, I expect that same
someone to have analysed the code. Then it also makes sense to put that
in the Changelog.

We are. That new patch describes a clear problem and fixes it.

Anyway, the reaoson I'm being difficuly is partly because on the one
hand I'm just an annoying pendant at times, but also because I've seen
a bunch of, let's say, hasty, KCSAN patches.
