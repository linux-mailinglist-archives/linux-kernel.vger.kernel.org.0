I don't think it's ever acceptable to get into an infinite loop.
Especially when you're running on the system's high priority work queue...

At the very least schedule a delayed work item to try again in some
number of seconds or something. Essentially just have more retires,
perhaps with longer delays in between.

Falling through and continuing with the wrong values is certainly wrong.
I didn't notice that. If an error occurs, it shouldn't continue, it
should print an error to dmesg and stop.

I'd change it. Seems completely wrong to me.
