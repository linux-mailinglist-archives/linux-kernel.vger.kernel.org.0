what does atm here mean?

We have needed multi-range support for quite a while, as common broadcom
SOCs do need it.  So patches for that are welcome at least from the
DMA layer perspective (kinda similar to your pseudo code earlier)

Well, using the legacy arm dma ops means we can't use swiotlb if there
is an offset, which is also wrong for lots of common cases, including
the Rpi 4.  I'm still curious why my patch didn't work, as I thought
it should.  We'll need to find the minimum change to make it work
for now without switching ops, even if it isn't the correct one, and
then work from there.
