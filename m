Hi,++ James,

OK. Agree.

Yes, this is a problem, and you mentioned that we have to define several new spe events for this, and I am still considering how to add them.(I originally wanted to add them to the spe driver, but this will not avoid the problem of multiple spe events you mentioned above.)

Based on scenarios where no new spe events are added, if the user specifies multiple spe events, I think we need to analyze these events and classify the spe events. If there are multiple, we need to keep only one (but record all spe events name or alias like "branch-misses, cache-misses" in some variables) and disable event_filter. Then "perf report" can create new selectors for these synthetic events and output them.

Thanks.
Xiaojun.
