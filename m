Hm, I don't think that baikal is a well known synonym of the company
either. Seeing the company isn't well known in general.) Here the
'Baikal' name is mostly associated with the deepest lake in the world.)

We had a discussion amongst our team developers what abbreviation to choose.
Some of us suggested to use 'baikal' prefix too. But after all we agreed to
set the 'be' one as being short and yet compatible with company name. However
it's unlikely that developers looking at vendor prefix would think of a lake
first and, you are right, that 'baikal' word would point to the original
company name better than 'be'. On the other hand the chips the company
produces also have 'baikal' in their names: Baikal-T1, Baikal-M1, etc.
So the compatible strings of the SoC components either would look like:
- be,bt1; be,baikal-t1 (SoC/machine compatible strings)
- be,bt1-i2c; be,bt1-pvt; be,bt1-efuse; be,bt1-axi-ic; etc (individual
  SoC subdevices compatible strings)
or
- baikal,bt1; baikal,baikal-t1
- baikal,bt1-i2c; baikal,bt1-pvt; baikal,bt1-efuse; baikal,bt1-axi-ic; etc

First version seemed less cumbersome, having less 'baikal' in the
compatible strings. In the second case the vendor prefix turned to be
longer than the rest of the component name, which is supposed to be the
main part of the string.

So you think 'baikal' would be better anyway? It would be great to hear
your opinion about this in details, because we still have doubts which
prefix is better.

(I'm so persistent in describing why we chose 'be' prefix, because in
case of changing it to 'baikal' I would have to alter all the drivers
we wrote, which you must agree isn't that pleasant work.)
