So the pcieport device and then the child device are added in the PCI 
scan, but only some time later do the device drivers probe for these 
devices; so it's not that the that pcieport driver creates the child device.

The problem then occurs in that the ordering the of device driver probe 
is such that we have this: pcieport probe + defer (as no IOMMU group 
registered), SMMU probe (registers the IOMMU group), child device probe, 
pcieport really probe.

Can't the piceport driver not add its child devices before it

The devices are actually added in order pcieport, child device, but not 
really probed in that same order, as above.

I'll add you to that thread if you want to discuss further.

Thanks,
John
