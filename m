The current wording from membarrier(2) is:

              The  "expedited" commands complete faster than the non-expedited
              ones; they never block, but have the downside of  causing  extra
              overhead.

We could simply remove the "; they never block" part then ?

Looking at:

#define GFP_KERNEL      (__GFP_RECLAIM | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS)

I notice that it does not include __GFP_NOFAIL. What prevents GFP_KERNEL from
failing, and where is this guarantee documented ?

Regarding __GFP_NOFAIL, its use seems to be discouraged in linux/gfp.h:

 * %__GFP_NOFAIL: The VM implementation _must_ retry infinitely: the caller
 * cannot handle allocation failures. The allocation could block
 * indefinitely but will never return with failure. Testing for
 * failure is pointless.
 * New users should be evaluated carefully (and the flag should be
 * used only when there is no reasonable failure policy) but it is
 * definitely preferable to use the flag rather than opencode endless
 * loop around allocator.
 * Using this flag for costly allocations is _highly_ discouraged.

So I am reluctant to use it.

But if we can agree on the right combination of flags that guarantees there
is no failure, I would be perfectly fine with using them to remove the fallback
code.

Thanks,

Mathieu
