Hi Eric,

Thank you for your comments.

Indeed, but sometimes fast reboot is more important than the cost of
reserving 32M-64M of memory.

I agree,  my measurement on this machine was 2,857MB/s. Perhaps when
MMU is disabled ARM64 also has caching disabled? The function that
loops through array of pages and relocates them to final destination
is this:

https://soleen.com/source/xref/linux/arch/arm64/kernel/relocate_kernel.S?r=d2912cb1#29

A comment before calling it:

205   /*
206   * cpu_soft_restart will shutdown the MMU, disable data caches, then
207   * transfer control to the reboot_code_buffer which contains a copy of
208   * the arm64_relocate_new_kernel routine.  arm64_relocate_new_kernel
209   * uses physical addressing to relocate the new image to its final
210   * position and transfers control to the image entry point when the
211   * relocation is complete.
212   * In kexec case, kimage->start points to purgatory assuming that
213   * kernel entry and dtb address are embedded in purgatory by
214   * userspace (kexec-tools).
215   * In kexec_file case, the kernel starts directly without purgatory.
216   */

So, as I understand at least data caches are disabled, and MMU is
disabled, perhaps this is why this function is so incredibly slow?

Perhaps, there is a better way to fix this problem by keeping caches
enabled while still relocating? Any suggestions from Aarch64
developers?
