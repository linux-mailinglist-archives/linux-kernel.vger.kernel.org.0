ACK. The TX type channel is acknowledged as soon as opposite side will
read out the TX/RX FIFO. In this case we will get an interrupt and
call mbox_chan_txdone(). With the TXDB type channels we have no this
kind of interrupts, so we need to some how to tell the mailbox framework
that this transmission is kind of done.

Beside, are there any reason why do you use TXDB instead of TX channel?
In this case you will get your ACK for free.

Sorry, I fail to follow this argumentation. If it important, please
describe your issue.

ACK. Same idx with different types.

Actually you will get it no by idx, you will get it by proper device
tree configuration and assigned cl->rx_callback(). You assign rx_callback() per
each rx-able channel.

The call chain of rx_callback() is:
imx_mu_isr()
  mbox_chan_received_data()
    cl->rx_callback()

Since rx_callback() is in interrupt context, send_msg() should be non
blocking. You can use workqueue or some thing like this to mbox_send_message()
out of interrupt context.

If properly implemented, you will have separate rx_callback()s for each
channel.

I assume at some later point you will need to extend the ACK to some
thing like:
- ACK - message is ok and processed
- BUSY - endpoint is still processing
- ERR - message is corrupt or wrong formatting
... and so on.

To be able to transmit different types of ACK you will probably
use TX/RX type channels + shmem instead of the doorbell.
