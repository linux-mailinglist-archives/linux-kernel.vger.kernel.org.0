I am pretty sure that has_unmovable_pages can special these pages
regardless of the reference count for the memory hotplug. We already do
that for HWPoison pages.

OK, this is exactly what I was worried about. I can see why you might
want to go an easier way and rule those users out but wouldn't be it
actually more reasonable to explicitly request PageOffline users to
implement MEM_GOING_OFFLINE and prepare their offlined pages for the
offlining operation or fail right there if that is not possible.
If you fail right there during the isolation phase then there is no way
to allow the offlining to proceed from that context.

If the driver is going to free page to the allocator then it would have
to claim the page back and so it is usable again. If it cannot free it
then it would simply set the reference count to 0. It can even keep the
PG_offline if necessary although I have to admit I am not really sure it
is necessary.

You should have your reference count 0 at this stage as it is after
MEM_GOING_OFFLINE.

Yeah, set_page_count(page, 0) if you do not want to release that page
from the notifier context to reflect that the page is ok to be offlined
with the rest.

Who is that somebody? I thought that it is only the owner/driver to have
a control over the page. Also the above is not possible as long as the
owner/driver keeps a reference to the PageOffline page throughout the
time it is marked that way.

Thanks, I was not aware of that code. But from what I understood this is
an outright bug in this code because cmm_mem_going_offline releases
pages to the buddy allocator which is something that is not recoverable
on a later failure.
