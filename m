Yes, we've had that for a while. So far it "worked" because the
explicit calls to add_preferred_console() tends to happen before the
parsing of the command line, and thus are "overriden" by the latter if
any.

No not exactly. Architectures/platforms use add_preferred_console()
(such as arm64 with ACPI but powerpc at least does it too) based on
various factors to select a reasonable "default" for that specific
platform. Without that the kernel will basically default to the first
one to register which may not be what you want.

The command line ones however want to override the defaults (provided
they exist, ie, it's possible that whever is specified on the command
line doesn't actually exist, and thus shall be ignored. That typically
happens when there is either no match or ->setup fails).

Why would the patch affect this negatively ? Today we stop on the first
match, mark the driver enabled, and make it preferred if the match
index matches preferred_console.

My patch makes us continue searching if it wasnt' the preferred console
(but we still mark it enabled). Which means either of those two things
happen:

 - No more match or another match that isn't the preferred_console,
this won't change the existing behaviour.

 - Another match that is marked preferred_console, in which case in
addition to being enabled, the newly registered console will also be
made the default console (ie, first in the list with CONSDEV set). This
is actually what we want ! IE. The console matches the last specified
one on the command line.

Cheers,
Ben.
