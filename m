Hmm, that sounds a bit off - if we have overlapping regions within the 
same domain, then we need to do some additional pre-processing to adjust 
them anyway, since any part of a relaxable region which overlaps a 
non-relaxable region cannot actually be relaxed, and so really should 
never be described as such.

Wasn't part of the idea that we might not need to expose these to 
userspace at all if they're only relevant to default domains, and not to 
VFIO domains or anything else userspace can get involved with?

What do you think of s/RELAXABLE/BOOT/ ? My understanding is that these 
regions are only considered relevant until Linux has taken full control 
of the endpoint, and having a slightly more well-defined scope than 
"some conditions" might be nice.

There's an open question of how to handle things like simple-fb and EFI 
framebuffer handover on Arm and other platforms, so I'd really like to 
be able to slot that right into this case as well (how we describe the 
relevant connections in DT/ACPI is another matter, but hey, one step at 
a time...)

Otherwise though, I too am pleased to see this, thanks! I did start 
having a go myself after talking to Alex at KVM Forum, but I got bogged 
down in the intel-iommu parts and inevitably distracted - patch #7 looks 
beautifully simpler than I'd convinced myself was possible :D
