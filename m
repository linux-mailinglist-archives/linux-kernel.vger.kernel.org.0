I imagine you are likely correct, ideally you would not map any
reserved pages in these spaces.

I've been reading the code to try to understand what you say above.
For identity mappings in the kernel, I see level2_ident_pgt mapping
the first 1G.  And I see early_dyanmic_pgts being set up with an
identity mapping of the kernel that seems to be pretty well restricted
to the range _text through _end.

Within the decompression code, I see an identity mapping of the first
4G set up within the 32 bit code.  I believe we go past that to the
startup_64 entry point.  (I don't know how common that path is, but I
don't have a way to test it without figuring out how to force it.)

From a pragmatic standpoint, the guy who can verify this for me is on
vacation, but I believe our BIOS won't ever place the halt-causing
ranges in a space below 4GiB.  Which explains why this patch works for
our hardware.  (We do have reserved regions below 4G, just not the
ones that hardware causes a halt for accessing.)

In case it helps you picture the situation, our hardware takes a small
portion of RAM from the end of each NUMA node (or it might be pairs or
quads of NUMA nodes, I'm not entirely clear on this at the moment) for
its own purposes.  Here's a section of our e820 table:

Our problem occurs when KASLR (or kexec) places the kernel close
enough to the end of one of the usable sections, and the 1G of 1:1
mapped space includes a portion of the following reserved section, and
speculation touches the reserved area.
