Can you add the relevant pieces of /proc/iomem output to the commit
message so we can see the memory configuration? I don't have the
hardware available where this kind of situation occurs.

You can still ask yourself that if the hardware describes the memory
with only one region do the code flows reduce mostly to do the same as
before this patch. It is not the same as testing with such hardware but
it is still a good mental exercise.

To summarize, I do get "not having hardware" part but completely
disqualify "not having expertise" part as the expertise needed here has
nothing specific to do with TPMs :-)

Please rename 'node' as 'list' for the sake of coherency with the rest
of the kernel and io_res as iores for the sake of coherency with the
other fields.

I think it would be cleaner to do the following:

1. Start with empty resource list.
2. Everytime crb_map_res() is called it does check the existing
   resources and does a ACPI walk on need basis at most adding
   one new entry.

In other words, crb_map_res() gets the list and appends one entry when
necessary.

Overhead of doing multiple walks is irrelevant here. The simplicity and
clarity win.
