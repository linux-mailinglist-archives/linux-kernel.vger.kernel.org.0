That works if history is linear.  I guess with enough effort we can make
that work in most cases (for backports it is a problem, if you want to
support a new feature -- or bugfix! -- you need to support all previous
ones as well...  Distros are going to hate us, too ;-) )

*You* bring up version detection.  I don't.  You want some halfway thing,
with some macros that say what version some part of your compiler is.

I say to just detect the feature you want, and if it actually works the
way you want it, etc.

Yes, I backported it so that it is available in 7.5, 8.3, and 9.1, so
that more users will have this available sooner.  (7.5 has not been
released yet, but asm inline has been supported in GCC 7 since Jan 2
this year).

It never was accepted, and I dropped the ball.

Sure, it is part of the documentation just fine.  And it works just fine
too, it is a *very* simple feature.  By design.

You can lurk on gcc-patches@ and/or gcc@?  But I'll try to remember, sure.
Not that I am involved in all such discussions myself, mind.
