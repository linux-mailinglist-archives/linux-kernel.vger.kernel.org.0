I want all the text poking (jump_label, ftrace, klp whatever) to happen
_before_ we do the protection changes.

I also want to avoid flipping the protection state around unnecessarily,
because that clearly is just wasted work.

Right, the problem is set_all_modules_text_*(), that relies on COMING
having made the protection changes.

After the x86 changes, there's only 2 more architectures that use that
function. I'll work on getting those converted and then we can delete
that function and worry no more about it.

I wanted to move the COMING notifier callback before the protection
changes, because that is the easiest way to convert jump_label and
static_call and AFAICT nothing really cared aside from ftrace.

The alternative is introducing additional module states, which just adds
complexity we don't really need if we can just flip things around a
little.

You mean it does module_disable_ro() ? That would be broken and it needs
to be fixed. Can some livepatch person explain what it does and why?
