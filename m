We are discussing 'struct sdw_master_driver'. Please be very specific in
you replies and do not use incorrect terminology which confuses people.

Sorry a 'struct sdw_master_driver' IMHO is. As I have said it is not
needed if you have standalone controller even in Intel case, and rest of
the world.

IMO the path I suggested is implementable..

And I guess you didn't talk to your Intel colleagues... Please talk to
them on how they did it.

If it is single master?

If it is multiple master with different ACPI ID for each master?

Would you still need 'struct sdw_master_driver'?

Again do not confuse by using incorrect terminology.

Again 'struct sdw_master_driver' for a specific Intel hw configuration is.
