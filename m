Yep, I think so fare we are all converging towards the idea to use the
a signed range. Regarding the range itself, yes: 1024 looks very
oversized, but +-20 is still something which leave room for a bit of
flexibility and it also better matches the idea that we don't want to
"enumerate behaviours" but just expose a knob. To map certain "bias" we
could benefit from a slightly larger range.

For the wakeup path there is also the TurboSched proposal by Parth:

   Message-ID: <20190725070857.6639-1-parth@linux.ibm.com> 
   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190725070857.6639-1-parth@linux.ibm.com/

we should keep in mind.

For LB can you come up with some better description of what usages you
see could benefit from a "per task" or "per task-group" latency niceness?

Best,
