Hi Chris,

My thought about per-cgroup swappiness is different applications should have different memory footprint.
For example, an application does a lot of file access work in a memory-constrained environment.  Its performance depend on the file access speed.  Keep more file cache will good for it.  Then more swappiness will good for it, especially with the high speed swap device(zram/zswap).
And in the same environment, an application that access anon memory a lot of times.  Use low swapiness will good for its performance.  But just let it not to swap is not a good for it because the code is inside file cache.  Just drop the file cache will decrease the application speed sometime.
Both of them are extreme examples.  Other applications maybe access both file and anon.  Maybe define a special swapiness is good for it.

This is what I thought about add swappiness to cgroup2.

Best,
Hui
