I'll also mention some other discrepencies that I've just spotted in
this register set.

The BMSR is 0x796d.  Bit 2 is the link status, which is indicating
that link is up.  Bit 5 indicates negotiation complete, which it
claims it is.

The PHY has a second status register at 0x11 which gives real time
information.  That is 0x0000.  Bit 10 indicates link up, and is
indicating that the link is down.  Bit 11 is saying that the speed
and duplex is not resolved either.

So, there's contradictory information being reported by this PHY.

This brings up several questions:
1. what is the _true_ state of the link?  Is the link up or down?

2. what does the link partner think is the current link state and
   results of negotiation?

3. should we be reading the register at 0x11 to determine the
   negotiation results and link state (maybe logically anding the
   present state with the BMSR link state)?


Compare that to a correctly functioning AR8035 such as I have in my
cubox-i4 connected to a Netgear GS116 switch:

   3100 796d 004d d072 15e1 c5e1 000d 2001
   0000 0200 3c00 0000 0000 4007 b29a a000
   0862 bc1c 0000 0000 082c 0000 07e8 0000
   3200 3000 0000 063e 0000 0005 2d47 8100.

BMSR is again 0x796d.  The PHY specific status register this time
is 0xbc1c, which indicates 1G, full duplex, resolved, link up, no
smartspeed downgrade, tx/rx pause.

The register at 0x10 is a control register, which is strangely also
different between our two.  Apparently in your PHY configuration,
auto-MDI crossover mode is disabled, you are forced to MDI mode.
On hardware reset, this register contains 0x0862, as per my
example above, but yours is zero.

I don't think the difference in register 0x10 can be explained away
by operation of the smartspeed feature - so maybe my theory about
the advertisement registers being cleared by the PHY is wrong.  The
question is: how is 0x10 getting reset to zero in your setup?  Maybe
something has corrupted the configuration of the PHY in ways that
Linux doesn't know how to reprogram?

Have you tried power-cycling the cubox-i?
