I've found that my poor results above were due to debug options
mistakenly left enabled in the defconfig. Sorry about that!

After cleaning it up I'm getting results around 5.6s for this test case.
I've run 50 iterations for each test, with 90s cool down period between
them.


 			Hackbench: (1 group , 30000 loops, 50 runs)
 				Result            Standard Deviation
 				(Time Secs)        (% of mean)

 No Thermal Pressure(step_wise)  5.644                   7.760%
 No Thermal Pressure(IPA)        5.677                   9.062%

 Thermal Pressure Averaging
 non-PELT Algo. Decay : 250 ms   5.627                   5.593%
 (step-wise, bigs capped only)

 Thermal Pressure Averaging
 non-PELT Algo. Decay : 250 ms   5.690                   3.738%
 (IPA)

All of the results above are within 1.1% difference with a
significantly higher standard deviation.

I wanted to run this initially to validate my setup and understand
if there is any conclusion we can draw from a test like this, that
floods the CPUs with tasks. Looking over the traces, the tasks are
running almost back to back, trying to use all available resources,
on all the CPUs.
Therefore, I doubt that there could be better decisions that could be
made, knowing about thermal pressure, for this usecase.

I'll try next some capacity inversion usecase and post the results when
they are ready.

Hope it helps,
Ionela.
