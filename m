You probably pushed your work on a dedicated repository on which this
robot has run. It does not make any difference between upstream sources
and downstream contributions. You may add this tag when you are
fixing something reported by the robot against the upstream kernel.
Here, the driver is new, this is a feature you are adding, so please
drop the tag.

Yes, just drop this check, only keep ret < 0.

Please add a comment with the above explanation.

I think you should enforce this alignment instead of checking it.

Please explain with a comment.

You are not in a critical path, I don't understand why you don't check
it? If it returns an error, it means the data is not written. IMHO it
is best to alert the user than to silently fail.
