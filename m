Subject: [PATCH v8 0/7] Unify CPU topology across ARM & RISC-V 
Date:   Thu, 27 Jun 2019 12:52:55 -0700

The cpu-map DT entry in ARM can describe the CPU topology in much better
way compared to other existing approaches. RISC-V can easily adopt this
binding to represent its own CPU topology. Thus, both cpu-map DT
binding and topology parsing code can be moved to a common location so
that RISC-V or any other architecture can leverage that.

The relevant discussion regarding unifying cpu topology can be found in
[1].

arch_topology seems to be a perfect place to move the common code. I
have not introduced any significant functional changes in the moved code.
The only downside in this approach is that the capacity code will be
executed for RISC-V as well. But, it will exit immediately after not
able to find the appropriate DT node. If the overhead is considered too
much, we can always compile out capacity related functions under a
different config for the architectures that do not support them.

There was an opportunity to unify topology data structure for ARM32 done
by patch 3/4. But, I refrained from making any other changes as I am not
very well versed with original intention for some functions that
are present in arch_topology.c. I hope this patch series can be served
as a baseline for such changes in the future.

The patches have been tested for RISC-V, ARM64, ARM32 & compile tested for
x86.

From Jeremy,

"I applied these to 5.2rc2, along with my PPTT/MT change and verified the 
system & scheduler topology/etc on DAWN and ThunderX2 using ACPI on arm64.
They appear to be working correctly.

so for the series,
Tested-by: Jeremy Linton <jeremy.linton@arm.com>"

The socket change[2] is also now part of this series.

This patch series can also be found at
https://github.com/atishp04/linux/tree/5.2-rc6_topology

QEMU changes for RISC-V topology are available here
https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2019-06/msg05974.html

HiFive Unleashed DT with topology node is available here.
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11014313/

Changes from v7->v8
1. Regenerated the patch series without -b option in git format-patch.
   Without that, git apply from email won't work because ignored space
   changes.
 
Changes from v6->v7
1. Added socket to HiFive Unleashed topology example.
2. Added Acked-by & Reviewed-by.

Changes from v5->v6
1. Added two more patches from Sudeep about maintainership of arch_topology.c
   and Kconfig update.
2. Added Tested-by & Reviewed-by
3. Fixed a nit (reordering of variables)

Changes from v4-v5
1. Removed the arch_topology.h header inclusion from topology.c and arch_topology.c
file. Added it in linux/topology.h.
2. core_id is set to -1 upon reset. Otherwise, ARM topology store function does not
work.

Changes from v3->v4
1. Get rid of ARM32 specific information in topology structure.
2. Remove redundant functions from ARM32 and use common code instead. 

Changes from v2->v3
1. Cover letter update with experiment DT for topology changes.
2. Added the patch for [2].

Changes from v1->v2
1. ARM32 can now use the common code as well.

Atish Patra (4):
dt-binding: cpu-topology: Move cpu-map to a common binding.
cpu-topology: Move cpu topology code to common code.
arm: Use common cpu_topology structure and functions.
RISC-V: Parse cpu topology during boot.
