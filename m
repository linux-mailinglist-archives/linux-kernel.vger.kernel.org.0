We do at least for cdrom_open.  It modifies the cdi structure with no
other protection and concurrent modification would at least screw up
the use counter which is not atomic.  Same reasoning for cdrom_release.

I think the ioctls don't need the mutex (not looked deeply enough) and
certainly the probe only requires it for the idr allocation which has
its own lock, so I don't believe the mutex additions are needed there.
