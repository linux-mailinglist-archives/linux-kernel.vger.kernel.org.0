Ok, if you want the DT loader to propagate UEFIDisplayInfo to a config
table, I can update the drm parts of my patchset to look for that in
addition to /chosen/panel-id

I've mixed feelings about requiring UEFI..  I definitely want to give
qcom an incentive to turn on GOP and full UEFI boot for future android
devices.  OTOH there are quite a few devices out there that aren't
UEFI boot.  But I guess if drm falls back to /chosen/panel-id we are
covered.

I'm a bit more concerned about DT loader getting into the business of
DT fixup..  I guess if we don't do that, it is less of a concern.  But
if we relied on it to fixup DT for installed panel, we could probably
make it work semi-generically on existing devices that have bridge and
panel wired up same way.  But seems like some of the 835 laptops have
bridge hooked up as child of dsi bus instead.  And someday we could
see devices using dsi directly, etc.

(It would be really nice to see DT loader able to pick the correct
.dtb based on smbios tables tho ;-).. but maybe different topic)

yeah, that will be a problem.. and also switching to older kernel
after upgrading when in-flight dt bindings evolve.  Having one less
moving part would be nice.

Maybe if adding a config table for UEFIDisplayInfo, you could also add
one for DT loader version, so (at least if user is able to get far
enough to get dmesg) we could see that more easily?
