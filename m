So if someone can explain to me how that works with lockdep I can of
course implement it. But afaics that doesn't exist (I tried to explain
that somewhere else already), and I'm no really looking forward to
hacking also on lockdep for this little series.

Hm, that's new to me. I thought mmu notifiers very much can be called
from direct reclaim paths, so you have to be extremely careful with
getting back into that one. At least the lockdep splats I remember
also tend to have fs_reclaim in there, that's where all the fun comes
from.

I guess the lockdep annotation for invalidate_range_start carries the
same risks as the fs_reclaim annotation. Still feels like worth it.
