The problem with only a flush here is that the sysrq output may not fit
in the ringbuffer (ftrace, for example). It probably makes more sense to
have a switch to enter/exit "synchronous state", where all atomic
consoles are flushed upon enter and all future printk's are synchronous
on atomic consoles until exit.

I expect sysrq to be the only valid use of "synchronous state" other
than oops/panic. Although I suppose PeterZ would like a boot argument to
always run the consoles in this state.

The switch/flush _will_ be visible. But not the state. So, for example,
it won't be possible for some random driver to determine if we are in an
emergency state. (Well, I don't know if oops_in_progress will really
disappear. But at least the printk/console stuff will no longer rely on
it.)

Thanks for bringing up that RFC thread again. I haven't looked at it in
over a year. I will go through it again to see if there is anything I've
overlooked. Particularly the suspend stuff.
