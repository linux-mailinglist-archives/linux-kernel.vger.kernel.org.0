In a way the /DISCARD/ assignment should be thought of as applying to 
_input_ sections (as all such section references on the RHS), not 
necessarily to output sections.  What this then means for sections that 
are synthesized by the link editor is less clear.  Some of them are 
generated regardless (as you noted, e.g. the symbol table and associated 
string sections, including section name string table), some of them are 
suppressed, and either lead to an followup error (e.g. with .gnu.hash), or 
to invalid output (e.g. missing .dynsym for executables simply lead to 
segfaults when running them).

That's the reason for the perceived inconsistency with behaviour on '*': 
it's application to synthesized sections.  Arguably bfd should be fixed to 
also not discard the other essential sections (or alternatively to give an 
error when an essential section is discarded).  The lld behaviour of e.g. 
discarding .shstrtab (or other synthesized sections necessary for valid 
ELF output) doesn't make much sense either, though.


Ciao,
Michael.
