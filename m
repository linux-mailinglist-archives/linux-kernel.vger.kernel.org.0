why "most of the time"? It should always succeed. We talk here about
__fpu__restore_sig() correct? Using init_fpstate as part of restore
process isn't the "default" case. If the restore _here_ fails then it
fails.

So if copy_user_to_fpregs_zeroing() fails then we go to the slowpath.
Then we load the FPU register with copy_kernel_to_xregs_err().
In the end they are either enabled (fpregs_mark_activate()) or cleared
if it failed (fpu__clear()). Don't see here a problem.

Can you tell me which glibc test? I would like to reproduce this.

So I don't need new HW with supervisor and CET? A plain KVM box with
SSE2 and so should be enough?
