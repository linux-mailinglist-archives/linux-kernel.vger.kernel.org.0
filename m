Note that I didn't make cpu_suspend required for arm,psci as some 
platforms didn't have that and the spec isn't clear if optional or 
required. One board (artpec6-devboard.dts) also doesn't implement 
cpu_off.

There's also 1 board (mt8173-evb.dts) that claims 0.1, 0.2, and 1.0
compatibility. I guess that's valid, but not really clear in the binding
doc. If we want to just allow any combination of versions, the schema
for compatible could be simplified a bit.

-* Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)
-
-Firmware implementing the PSCI functions described in ARM document number
-ARM DEN 0022A ("Power State Coordination Interface System Software on ARM
-processors") can be used by Linux to initiate various CPU-centric power
-operations.
-
-Issue A of the specification describes functions for CPU suspend, hotplug
-and migration of secure software.
-
-Functions are invoked by trapping to the privilege level of the PSCI
-firmware (specified as part of the binding below) and passing arguments
-in a manner similar to that specified by AAPCS:
-
-	 r0		=> 32-bit Function ID / return value
-	{r1 - r3}	=> Parameters
-
-Note that the immediate field of the trapping instruction must be set
-to #0.
-
-
-Main node required properties:
-
- - compatible    : should contain at least one of:
-
-     * "arm,psci"     : For implementations complying to PSCI versions prior
-			to 0.2.
-			For these cases function IDs must be provided.
-
-     * "arm,psci-0.2" : For implementations complying to PSCI 0.2.
-			Function IDs are not required and should be ignored by
-			an OS with PSCI 0.2 support, but are permitted to be
-			present for compatibility with existing software when
-			"arm,psci" is later in the compatible list.
-
-     * "arm,psci-1.0" : For implementations complying to PSCI 1.0.
-			PSCI 1.0 is backward compatible with PSCI 0.2 with
-			minor specification updates, as defined in the PSCI
-			specification[2].
-
- - method        : The method of calling the PSCI firmware. Permitted
-                   values are:
-
-                   "smc" : SMC #0, with the register assignments specified
-		           in this binding.
-
-                   "hvc" : HVC #0, with the register assignments specified
-		           in this binding.
-
-Main node optional properties:
-
- - cpu_suspend   : Function ID for CPU_SUSPEND operation
-
- - cpu_off       : Function ID for CPU_OFF operation
-
- - cpu_on        : Function ID for CPU_ON operation
-
- - migrate       : Function ID for MIGRATE operation
-
-Device tree nodes that require usage of PSCI CPU_SUSPEND function (ie idle
-state nodes, as per bindings in [1]) must specify the following properties:
-
-- arm,psci-suspend-param
-		Usage: Required for state nodes[1] if the corresponding
-                       idle-states node entry-method property is set
-                       to "psci".
-		Value type: <u32>
-		Definition: power_state parameter to pass to the PSCI
-			    suspend call.
-
-Example:
-
-Case 1: PSCI v0.1 only.
-
-	psci {
-		compatible	= "arm,psci";
-		method		= "smc";
-		cpu_suspend	= <0x95c10000>;
-		cpu_off		= <0x95c10001>;
-		cpu_on		= <0x95c10002>;
-		migrate		= <0x95c10003>;
-	};
-
-Case 2: PSCI v0.2 only
-
-	psci {
-		compatible	= "arm,psci-0.2";
-		method		= "smc";
-	};
-
-Case 3: PSCI v0.2 and PSCI v0.1.
-
-	A DTB may provide IDs for use by kernels without PSCI 0.2 support,
-	enabling firmware and hypervisors to support existing and new kernels.
-	These IDs will be ignored by kernels with PSCI 0.2 support, which will
-	use the standard PSCI 0.2 IDs exclusively.
-
-	psci {
-		compatible = "arm,psci-0.2", "arm,psci";
-		method = "hvc";
-
-		cpu_on = < arbitrary value >;
-		cpu_off = < arbitrary value >;
