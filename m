That's very true, it was a mistake in the Makefile change that I provided with
the original iteration of this patch, that had as a side effect of having ftrace
involved (_mcount is defined in entry-ftrace.c).

I was overriding:

CFLAGS_REMOVE_vgettimeofday.o = $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE) -Os

with:

CFLAGS_REMOVE_vgettimeofday.o = -mcmodel=tiny (selected if clang is < 8)

that's why I said that I missed a "+" in my previous patch.

Having:

CFLAGS_REMOVE_vgettimeofday.o += -mcmodel=tiny

restores the wanted behavior.

Sorry for not being clear in my explanation.
