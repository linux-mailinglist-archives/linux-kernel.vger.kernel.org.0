A compromise might be to set a flag in setup_log_buf(). It is called
much earlier but it seems to be safe enough.

mm_init() is called close after setup_log_buf(). And it seems to be
using per-cpu variables when creating caches, see:

  + mm_init()
    + kmem_cache_init()
      + create_boot_cache()
        + __kmem_cache_create()
	  + setup_cpu_cache()

It is just a detail. But I would make the flag independent
on the existing printk_safe stuff. printk_safe will get removed
with the lockless printk buffer. While the irq_work() will still
be needed for the wakeup functions.

Sergey, do you agree and want to update your patch accordingly?

Best Regards,
Petr
