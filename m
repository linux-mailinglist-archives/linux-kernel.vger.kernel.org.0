In this case, the probe will be placed at foo+0x00, so pre_handler() 
seeing that address in pt_regs is correct behavior - as long as arm64 
'brk' instruction causes an exception with the instruction pointer set 
*to* the 'brk' instruction. This is similar to how powerpc 'trap' works.  
However, x86 'int3' causes an exception *after* execution of the 
instruction.

In this case, if user asks for a probe to be placed at 'foo', we will 
choose foo+0x04 and from that point on, the behavior should reflect that 
a kprobe was placed at foo+0x04. In particular, the pre_handler() should 
see foo+0x04 in pt_regs. The post_handler() would then see foo+0x08.

I didn't mean to compare regular trap/brk based kprobes with 
KPROBES_ON_FTRACE. The only important aspect is that the handlers see 
consistent pt_regs in both cases, depending on where the kprobe was 
placed. Choosing a different address/offset to place a kprobe during its 
registration is an orthogonal aspect.

Given your explanation above, I think you can simply drop the first 
adjustment to the instruction pointer before the pre handler invocation.  
The rest of the code looks fine.
