this is a structure used by intel_init(), see the following code.

+		md = sdw_md_add(&intel_sdw_driver,
+				res->parent,
+				acpi_fwnode_handle(adev),
+				i);

that will in turn call intel_master_probe() as defined below:

+struct sdw_md_driver intel_sdw_driver = {
+	.probe = intel_master_probe,
+	.startup = intel_master_startup,
+

>> +		md->driver->probe(md, link);

There is no match for the master because it doesn't have an existence in 
ACPI. There are no _ADR or HID that can be used, the only thing that 
exists is the Controller which has 4 sublinks. Each master must be added 
  by hand.

Also the SoundWire master cannot be enumerated or matched against a 
SoundWire bus, since it controls the bus itself (that would be a chicken 
and egg problem). The SoundWire master would need to be matched on a 
parent bus (which does not exist for Intel) since the hardware is 
embedded in a larger audio cluster that's visible on PCI only.

Currently for Intel platforms, the SoundWire master device is created by 
the SOF driver (via the abstraction in intel_init.c).

I2C controllers are typically PCI devices or have some sort of ACPI 
description. This is not the case for SoundWire masters on Intel 
platforms, so even if I wanted to I would have no ability to implement 
any matching or parent bus registration.

Also the notion of 'probe' does not necessarily mean that the device is 
attached to a bus, we use DAI 'drivers' in ASoC and still have 
probe/remove callbacks.

And if you look at the definitions, we added additional callbacks since 
probe/remove are not enough to deal with hardware restrictions:

For Intel platforms, we have a startup() callback which is only invoked 
once the DSP is powered and the rails stable. Likewise we added an 
'autonomous_clock_stop()' callback which will be needed when the Linux 
driver hands-over control of the hardware to the DSP firmware, e.g. to 
deal with in-band wakes in D0i3.

FWIW, the implementation here follows what was suggested for Greybus 
'Host Devices' [1] [2], so it's not like I am creating any sort of 
dangerous precedent.
