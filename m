yeah right, I'm giving one treatment but I mean not any further.

Honestly I'm a bit confused on the border line between hardware
and software definition. That's quite reasonable it's policy that software
can poll more often than hardware specified, but can we think it's just
overriding hardware property specifying maximum value from beginning?
Is it still policy? or 'overriding hardware property' part is already not
a hardware description? :-S
