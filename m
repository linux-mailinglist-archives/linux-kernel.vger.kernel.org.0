I suppose we should just state that clk_set_rate() should do a
root-to-leaf update. It's not like anyone is interested in changing
this behavior. The notifier is not ideal. I've wanted to add a new
clk_op that would cover some amount of the notifier users by having a
'pre_set_rate' clk op that can mux the clk over to something safe or
setup a divider to something that is known to be safe and work. Then we
can avoid having to register for a notifier just to do something right
before the root-to-leaf update happens.

Ahaha ok. As you can see I'm trying to forget clock protect ;-)

And then when the clk is disabled it will magically "unstick" and start
to accept the same rate request again?

Fun times!
