Ah, takes a intel-gfx@ for CI to pick up patches atm.

I think it stems from the expectation that vgem provides "device
coherency" for CPU access. From the testing perspective, it's nice to
emulate HW interactions; but maybe that is just beyond the general
capabilities and we cannot simply use vgem as we do currently. That
would leave a hole for mocking prime in CI that needs filling :(
