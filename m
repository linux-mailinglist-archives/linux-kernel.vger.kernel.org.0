Hi Roman,

Thanks for the time you spent on this. I had *thought* that I ruled out my
config before posting .. but clearly, it is either not my config or something
else in the environment.

Indeed. I'm going to dive back in and see what I can find. If I can
find something
that is reproducible in a completely different environment and easy to configure
components, I'll follow up with details.

When I figure out what is going on with the config here, I'll follow up as well,
so the solution can be captured in any archives.

Thanks again,

Bruce
