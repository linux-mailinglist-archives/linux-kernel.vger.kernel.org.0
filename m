I can update that, sure.

Do you mean the processes sharing the file will suddenly gain
O_NONBLOCK? I didn't think that was true, but I can test. If it is true,
we could easily just restore the state before exit.

That is true, yes, though I still think it's an improvement over the
existing case of sphinx-build getting run with -jauto which lands us in
the same (or worse) position.

The best solution would be to teach sphinx-build about the Make
jobserver, though I expect that would be weird. Another idea would be to
hold the reservation until sphinx-build finishes and THEN return the
slots? That would likely need to change from a utility to a sphinx-build
wrapper...

Whoops! Yes, that needs fixing too. I'll send a patch...
