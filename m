Good point.

I tried to find the commit that introduced the "freezing" and I think it
is this one:

  03ba3782e8dc writeback: switch to per-bdi threads for flushing data

Unfortunately from that commit it is not clear (at least to me) why it
calls set_freezable() for the bdi task. It does not look like it has
anything to do with blocking writes to storage while entering
hibernation but I may be mistaken.
