Rob opined to me that if you apply the series, it will go into 5.4 unless
reverted.  That is also what I would expect.

I'm going through the series carefully now.  This is currently my highest
priority task.  I don't yet know if my comments will be minor, or whether
I will have larger changes to request.

So I am not ready to ack the series yet.
