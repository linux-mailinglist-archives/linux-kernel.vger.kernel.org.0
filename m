Like you said below, the ideal run time for each cgroup should depend on
their individual weight. The fact cgroupA has two tasks doesn't mean it
has twice the weight. Both cgroup can have the same cpu.share settings
and then, the more task a cgroup has, the less weight it can get for the
cgroup's per-cpu se.

I now realized one thing that's different in your idle_allowance
implementation and my core_vruntime implementation. In your
implementation, the idle_allowance is absolute time while vruntime can
be adjusted by the se's weight, that's probably one area your
implementation can make things less fair then mine.

Agree.

I'm not sure if this is always possible.

Say on a 16cores/32threads machine, there are 3 cgroups, each has 16 cpu
intensive tasks, will it be possible to make things perfectly balanced?

Don't get me wrong, I think this kind of load balancing is good and
needed, but I'm not sure if we can always make things perfectly
balanced. And if not, do we care those few cores where cgroup tasks are
not balanced and then, do we need to implement the core_wide cgoup
fairness functionality or we don't care since those cores are supposed
to be few and isn't a big deal?

Understood.

Yes I think this is definitely a good thing to do.
