To be honest, part of the solution should be to require Sphinx 1.8 or
later. Even Debian stable has it. If your distro doesn't have it
(really?), using the latest Sphinx in a virtual environment should be a
matter of:

$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ . .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
(.venv) $ make htmldocs

BR,
