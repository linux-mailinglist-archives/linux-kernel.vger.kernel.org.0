When I write changelogs for patches like this I usually describe, what
is the potential race - e.g.
	CPU1			CPU2
	path1			path2
	  check			  lock
	  			    operation2
				  unlock
	    lock
	    # check might not hold anymore
	    operation1
	    unlock

and what is the effect of the race - e.g. a crash, data corruption,
pointless attempt for operation1 which fails with user visible effect
etc.
This helps reviewers and everybody reading the code in the future to
understand the locking scheme.

It might be obvious but in many cases it is useful to minimize the
locking and do a potentially race check before the lock is taken if the
resulting operation can handle that.

I am not disputing that. What I am trying to say is that the changelog
should described the problem in the first place.

Moreover, look at the code you are trying to fix. Sure extending the
locking seem straightforward but does it result in a correct code
though? See my question in the previous email. How do we know that the
page is actually enqued in a non-empty list?
