Right, and now I did boot up my own laptop with the -next kernel, and
tested the patch. It definitely breaks things, so that was not the
issue. However, I don't get the WARN_ON either, so don't have any better
ideas. I guess we'll have to wait for someone who actually knows the
iwlwifi driver to take a look at this :)
