I had no idea this was the case. I can look into it if we are still
seeing failures.

IIRC, when KASLR is enabled (and we have a seed), we override the
runtime decision to out out of KPTI, and so even uarchs that don't
require the Meltdown mitigations it provides will still be using it.

So I'd be fine with just adding a note to the UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0
Kconfig help text that even non-affected uarchs have a use for it if
KASLR is enabled, but given that it is already behind EXPERT, I don't
think more hand holding is necessary.
