Yes. I did that! :) I think it was to make sure there weren't any orphan
clks in the tree, which is why I left the code in place to read the clk
frequency but not change it by omitting a frequency table.

No? I don't believe the kernel should be controlling this clk through
direct register read/writes. Instead, the GPU frequency should be
controlled through an RPM clk. See oxili_gfx3d_clk_src in the link you
mention above [1] and how it indirects to gfx3d_clk_src via
RPM_MEM_CLK_TYPE and OXILI_ID. In the end, anything that's parented to
this rcg in mmcc should probably just be parented to the RPM clk
instead.
