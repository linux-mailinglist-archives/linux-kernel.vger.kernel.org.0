I see. So the patch [2/2] is just removing useless rcu_read_lock()
and use non RCU api for kprobe_table, because those code never be
called from rcu read-side critical section. (It makes a critical section
only for using RCU list operation)

That is OK for me, anyway the [2/2] also introduces some lockdep_assert_held()
instead of rcu_read_lock() so that lockdep can check sanity.

I think lockdep_assert_held() is enough.
