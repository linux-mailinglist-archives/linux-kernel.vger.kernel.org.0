I will double check how much extra memory it requires, but it depends on
how many elements we have in "bulk list" and the size of the
kfree_rcu_bulk_data structure. So, i will run "rcuperf" to see what we
have.

OK, i see that. As far as i see we need to have per-cpu implementation
first, i mean kfree_rcu() should be per-cpu.

Not really. It does not depend on exact number, whereas it is clear
that setting it to 1 does not make sense :) Also the size of the
kfree_rcu_bulk_data struct should not be more then PAGE_SIZE due to
memory fragmentation problems.

Yes it should be possible. If we set krcp->bhead to NULL in case of
failure we can loose previous queued "bulk elements". But i see your
point and will rework it, trying to get rid of "goto" jump.
