yes, I've stumpled into this myself :(

Do you see any chance for some tool-based assistance ?

Few ideas coming into my mind:

a) kernel.org ops could collect bouncing addresses and match them
    against the MAINTAINERS file. Maybe post an alert with specific
    syntax (so it's easy to filter/monitor), so we can look around
    how to reach the missing folks (already did so myself). Sometimes
    those messages reach the missing folks by some other channel.

b) automatic scan/report for duplicate or unclaimed files.
    maybe this topic just needs more awareness.

    IMHO, every file should have a maintainer, because just posting to
    lkml globally has high risk of getting unnoticed.

c) automatic report of potentially unmaintained areas, so


By the way: if you prefer a more personal conversation, feel free to
call me (I'm settled @Schwabach)

I'm already keen on reading your thesis paper. (and if there's a public
presentation, I'd like to be there). You've picked a very good, useful
topic - we need more of that :)

Yes, but it can only work well with good data. So it's good that you
take care of that. And if you can improve the performance of this
script, I'd highly welcome that.

I'd like to recommend you as the maintainer of the MAINTAINERS file ;-)

Orphaned code IMHO deserves it's own discussion. Maybe we should have
some comments on why exactly orphaned/obsolete but still there (just no
maintainer anymore ? obsoleted by something else ? ...).

There're also some with status "Orphaned / Obsolete" - did you already
catch them ?
