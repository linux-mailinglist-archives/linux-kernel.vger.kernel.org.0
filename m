The disable_interrupts() should be called to reset the flag if, while 
probing, the interrupt handler wasn't called. Maybe that t490s returns 
either via this path

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis_core.c#L631

or this one here

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/char/tpm/tpm_tis_core.c#L634

thinking the (shared) interrupt is not for it?! But this would mean 
TPM_INT_STATUS is broken...
