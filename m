Good morning from Singapore,

Does Linux Kernel 5.5.7 have automatic built-in support for aufs and 
unionfs filesystems? Or do I need to apply the aufs and unionfs patches 
as outlined in the following year 2013 guide?

Guide: "New hint submission: Build your own LFS livecd."

Link: 
http://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/pipermail/hints/2013-March/003307.html

I have just created my own custom Linux distribution called Teo En Ming 
Linux 2020.03 (FINAL), which is based on Linux From Scratch 
20200302-systemd and Linux Kernel 5.5.7. I am trying to create a 
bootable Live CD/DVD iso of Teo En Ming Linux 2020.03 (FINAL).

Hopefully I do not have to patch Linux Kernel 5.5.7 to enable support 
for aufs and unionfs filesystems.

Nonetheless, compiling Linux Kernel 5.5.7 took only a mere 19 minutes on 
my latest state-of-the-art AMD Ryzen 3 3200G processor with Radeon Vega 
8 Graphics and Gigabyte B450M DS3H Socket AM4 motherboard with 32 GB 
Transcend DDR4-2666 RAM.

Please advise.

Thank you.
