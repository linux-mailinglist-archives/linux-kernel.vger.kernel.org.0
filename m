That's a known issue that we've fixed on the Intel side a  month or two 
ago. Unfortunately the review cycle is so slow that you don't benefit 
immediately from our fixes, what can I say.

It's fine but that's unnecessary, and if you start having multiple 
machine drivers with the same codecs you'll duplicate the stream 
handling code.

All you need to ensure in a multi-codec or multi-cpu dai case is that 
the stream is allocated once, and yes that's typically done as part of 
the dailink .startup callback.

Then it's fine to call the stream prepare or enable multiple times from 
the individual dai level, and only do the transition for the first call.

See patch "soundwire: stream: only change state if needed" that I just 
shared. We've used it both in 'TDM' mode with two codecs hanging off of 
the same link and in 'aggregated' mode with two codecs on separate links.
