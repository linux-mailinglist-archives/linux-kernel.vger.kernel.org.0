Well, if the assumption is true, wouldn't the Juergen's approach solved the
problem?  As previously said, I tried the approach but failed to solve this
race.  The assumption is wrong or I missed something.  I think Juergen also
think the assumption is not true as he suggested use of locking but not sure.
Juergen, if I misunderstood, please let me know.
