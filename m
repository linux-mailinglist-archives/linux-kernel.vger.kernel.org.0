Subject: [PATCH 0/9] TopDown metrics support for Icelake
Date:   Tue, 21 May 2019 14:40:46 -0700

From: Kan Liang <kan.liang@linux.intel.com>

Icelake has support for measuring the level 1 TopDown metrics
directly in hardware. This is implemented by an additional METRICS
register, and a new Fixed Counter 3 that measures pipeline SLOTS.

Four TopDown metric events as separate perf events, which map to
internal METRICS register, are exposed. They are topdown-retiring,
topdown-bad-spec, topdown-fe-bound and topdown-be-bound.
Those events do not exist in hardware, but can be allocated by the
scheduler. We use a special 0xff event code, which is reserved for
software. The value of TopDown metric events can be calculated by
multiplying the METRICS (percentage) register with SLOTS fixed counter.

New in Icelake
- Do not require generic counters. This allows to collect TopDown always
  in addition to other events.
- Measuring TopDown per thread/process instead of only per core

Limitation
- To get accurate result and avoid reading the METRICS register multiple
  times, the TopDown metrics events and SLOTS event have to be in the
  same group.
- METRICS and SLOTS registers have to be cleared after each read by SW.
  That is to prevent the lose of precision and a known side effect of
  METRICS register.
- Cannot do sampling read SLOTS and TopDown metric events

Please refer SDM Vol3, 18.3.9.3 Performance Metrics for the details of
TopDown metrics.
