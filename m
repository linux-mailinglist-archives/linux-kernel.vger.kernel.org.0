I am not suggesting to remove all comments. Some human readable
explanation is important as long as the code is developed by humans.

I think that I'll have to accept also the extra comments if you are
really going to use them to check the consistency by a tool. Or
if they are really used for review by some people.

Sounds good.

Do all this manuals, tools, people use any common syntax, please?
Would it be usable in our case as well?

I would like to avoid reinventing the wheel. Also I do not want
to create a dialect for few people that other potentially interested
parties will not understand.
