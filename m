Ick, ok, this needs to be documented really well then.

That's nice for the vfio stuff, but you are just a "normal" driver here.
You want an ioctl that just does one thing, no arguments, no flags, no
anything.  No need for a size argument then at all.  These ioctls don't
even need a structure for them!

Don't try to be fancy, it's not needed, it's not like you are running
out of ioctl space...
