In SLE and openSUSE kernels it is disabled for x86_64 at this
point. And if I am not completely misstaken only x86_64 supports it at
this point. I was looking at enable_sched_clock_irqtime() which is
only called from x86_64.

Another thing I noticed get_util_irq() is defined in
kernel/sched/sched.h. I don't think the block/blq-mq.c driver should
include it direclty.

Thanks,
Daniel

ps: A customer observes the same problem as Ming is reporting.
