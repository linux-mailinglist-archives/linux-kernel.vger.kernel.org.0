Hmmmm, IMHO it's almost impossible to define "too early" here... Does
it mean applications in the critical boot path? Does gnome-session =>
libICE => libbsd => getentropy() => getrandom() => generated MIT magic
cookie count as being too early? It's very hazy...

getrandom(2) basically has no guaranteed upper bound for the waiting
time. And in the report I submitted in the parent thread, the upper
bound is really "infinitely locked"...

Here is a trace_printk() log of all the getrandom() calls done from
system boot:

    systemd-random--179   2.510228: getrandom(512 bytes, flags = 1)
    systemd-random--179   2.510239: getrandom(512 bytes, flags = 0)
            polkitd-294   3.903699: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)
            polkitd-294   3.904191: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)

                          ... + 45 similar instances

    gnome-session-b-327   4.400620: getrandom(16 bytes, flags = 0)

                          ... boot blocks here, until
                              pressing some keys

    gnome-session-b-327   49.32140: getrandom(16 bytes, flags = 0)

                          ... + 3 similar instances

        gnome-shell-335   49.553594: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)
        gnome-shell-335   49.553600: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)

                          ... + 10 similar instances

           Xwayland-345   50.129401: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)
           Xwayland-345   50.129491: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)

        gnome-shell-335   50.487543: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)
        gnome-shell-335   50.487550: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)

                          ... + 79 similar instances

      gsd-xsettings-390   51.431638: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)
      gsd-clipboard-389   51.432693: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)
      gsd-xsettings-390   51.433899: getrandom(8 bytes, flags = 1)
      gsd-smartcard-388   51.433924: getrandom(110 bytes, flags = 0)
      gsd-smartcard-388   51.433936: getrandom(256 bytes, flags = 0)

                          ... + 3 similar instances

And it goes on, including processes like gsd-power-, gsd-xsettings-,
gsd-clipboard-, gsd-print-notif, gsd-clipboard-, gsd-color,
gst-keyboard-, etc.

What's the boundary of "too early" here? It's kinda undefinable..

At least for generating the MIT cookie, it would make some sort of
sense... Really caring about truly random-numbers while using Xorg
is almost like perfecting a hard-metal door for the paper house ;)

(Jokes aside, I understand that this cannot be the solution)

Just 8 days ago, systemd v243 was released, with systemd-random-seed(8)
now supporting *crediting* the entropy while loading the random seed:

    https://systemd.io/RANDOM_SEEDS

systemd-random-seed do something similar to what OpenBSD does, by
preserving the seed across reboots at /var/lib/systemd/random-seed.

This is not enabled by default though. Will distributions enable it by
default in the future? I have no idea \_(.)_/

For non-x86 _embedded_ systems at least, usually the BSP provider
enables the necessary hwrng driver in question and credit its entropy;
e.g. 62f95ae805fa (hwrng: omap - Set default quality).

Yeah, this is a hard engineering problem. You've earlier summarized it
perfectly here:

    https://lore.kernel.org/r/20180514003034.GI14763@thunk.org

I guess, to summarize earlier e-mails, a nice path would be:

    1. Cutting down the number of bits needed to initialize the CRNG
       to 256 bits (CHACHA20 cipher)

    2. Complaining loudly when getrandom() is used while the CRNG is
       not yet initialized.

    3. Hopefully #2 will force distributions to act: either trusting
       RDRANDOM when it's sane, configuring systmed-random-seed(8) to
       credit the entropy by default, etc.

Thanks!
