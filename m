My reading of the arm32 __dma_alloc() is that if the conditions are
right for the CMA allocator (allows blocking) and there is a default CMA
area or a per-device one, the call ends up in cma_alloc() without any
fallback if such allocation fails. Whether this is on purpose, I'm not
entirely sure. There are a couple of arm32 SoCs which call
dma_declare_contiguous() or dma_contiguous_reserve_area() and a few DT
files describing a specific CMA range (e.g. arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i.dtsi
with a comment that address must be kept in the lower 256MB).

If ZONE_DMA is set up correctly so that cma_alloc() is (or can be made)
interchangeable with alloc_pages(GFP_DMA) from a device DMA capability
perspective , I think it should be fine to have such fallback.
