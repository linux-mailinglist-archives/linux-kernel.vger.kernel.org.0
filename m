I agree, stuff in drivers/staging/ must be self-contained, with no
changes outside of the code's subdirectory needed in order for it to
work.  That way it is trivial for us to delete it when it never gets
cleaned up :)

You never say _why_ this should go into drivers/staging/, nor do you
have a TODO file like all other staging code that explains exactly what
needs to be done to get it out of there.
