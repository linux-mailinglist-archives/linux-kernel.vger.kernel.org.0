For cases where common code might be invoked both from the reader
(with RCU protection) and from the updater (protected by some
lock).  This common code can then use the optional argument to
hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() to truthfully tell lockdep that it might be
called with either form of protection in place.

This also combines with the __rcu tag used to mark RCU-protected
pointers, in which case sparse complains when a non-RCU API is applied
to these pointers, to get back to your earlier question about use of
hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() within the update-side lock.

But what are you seeing as actively harmful about all of this?
What should we be doing instead?

If you are suggesting that KCSAN might replace sparse's use of __rcu,
I have been attempting to think along those lines, but thus far without
any success.  In contrast, I am starting to think that lockdep has made
the sparse __acquires() and __releases() tags obsolete.

Or am I missing your point?

							Thanx, Paul
