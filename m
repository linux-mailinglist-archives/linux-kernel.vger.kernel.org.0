Possibly, though not sure how you'd detect such scenario.

I think there is another race here. IIUC, the assumption you make is
that when mm_users <= 1 && mm_count == 1, the only active user of this
pgd/ASID is on the CPU doing the TLBI. This is not the case for
try_to_unmap() where the above condition may be true but the active
thread on a different CPU won't notice the local TLBI.

I was actually curious what triggered this patch series, whether you've
seen a real use-case where the TLBI was a bottleneck.
