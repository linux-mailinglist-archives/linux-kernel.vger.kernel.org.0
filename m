I am not deeply familiar with the CMA implementation but from a very
brief look it seems that the bitmap simply denotes which portions of the
reserved area are used and therefore it is easy to find portions of the
requested size by scanning it.

Isolation will set the migrate type to MIGRATE_ISOLATE, btw the comment
in the code I referred to says this:
 * Making page-allocation-type to be MIGRATE_ISOLATE means free pages in
 * the range will never be allocated. Any free pages and pages freed in the
 * future will not be allocated again. If specified range includes migrate types
 * other than MOVABLE or CMA, this will fail with -EBUSY. For isolating all
 * pages in the range finally, the caller have to free all pages in the range.
 * test_page_isolated() can be used for test it.

Reclaim part will simply drop all pages that are easily reclaimable
(e.g. a clean pagecache) and migration will move existing allocations to
a different physical location + update references to it from other data
structures (e.g. page tables to point to a new location).

reclaim_clean_pages_from_list is a simple wrapper on top of shrink_page_list.
It simply takes clean page cache pages to reclaim it because that might
be less expensive than migrating that memory.

This is a core of the memory reclaim. It unmaps/frees pages and try to
free them.

I would recommend to read the code carefully and following the git
history of the code is very helpful as well. This is not a rocket
science, really.
