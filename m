We already have some DT unittests around platform devices. It would be
nice to extend them to demonstrate this problem. Could be a follow-up
patch though.

In the case a driver hasn't been updated, couldn't the driver core
just remove all the links of C to S and S to C so that progress can be
made and we retain the status quo of what we have today? That would
lessen the chances of breaking platforms and reduce the immediate need
to fix them.
