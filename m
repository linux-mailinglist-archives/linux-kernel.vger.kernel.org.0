I tend to agree with you here. Given that the modifiers were introduced mostly to
help vendors add their ideosyncratic bits, having a generic flag as a modifier is
not a good idea.

Isn't it how AMD currently implements protected buffers as well?

I also expect that going through the secure world will be pretty much transparent for
the kernel driver, as the most likely hardware implementations would enable
additional signaling that will get trapped and handled by the secure OS. I'm not
trying to simplify things, just taking the stance that it is userspace that is
coordinating all this, we're trying only to find a common ground on how to handle
this in the kernel.
