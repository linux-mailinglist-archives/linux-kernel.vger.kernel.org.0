Hi,

please consider applying this patch series. Its goal is to ultimately
provide accurate clock sources from PLLs configured by firmware on MMP2 a=
nd
MMP3. Currently they are hardcoded to more or less wrong values, which
causes bad timings when they are use (e.g. to generate display clock).

It starts off with a handful of cleanups:

  [PATCH 01/10] clk: mmp2: Remove a unused prototype
  [PATCH 02/10] clk: mmp2: Constify some strings
  [PATCH 03/10] dt-bindings: clock: Convert marvell,mmp2-clock to

The next patch adds the logic for calculating the rate of clock signals
coming from the PLLs dynamically, while not actually switching the
driver over to using it.

  [PATCH 04/10] clk: mmp2: Add support for PLL clock sources

Then MMP2 is switched over:

  [PATCH 05/10] clk: mmp2: Stop pretending PLL outputs are constant

Switching MMP3 requires some more work, because until now, the driver
has been the same for both versions of the SoC:

  [PATCH 06/10] dt-bindings: clock: Add MMP3 compatible string
  [PATCH 07/10] clk: mmp2: Check for MMP3
  [PATCH 08/10] dt-bindings: marvell,mmp2: Add clock ids for MMP3 PLLs
  [PATCH 09/10] clk: mmp2: Add PLLs that are available on MMP3
  [PATCH 10/10] ARM: dts: mmp3: Use the MMP3 compatible string for

The hardware vendor doesn't supply documentation, so this is best-effort
work based on the code dump from Marvell.

Tested on MMP2 and MMP3 based hardware I have; details in relevant
commit messages.

Thank you,
Lubo
