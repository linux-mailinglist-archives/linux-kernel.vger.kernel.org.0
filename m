Ok, thanks.  Jessica, the issue here is that we have two (mutually
exclusive) modules providing the same interface to a third module.

Andrea will check that, when the same symbol is exported by two modules,
the second-loaded module correctly fails insmod.  If that is okay, we
will also need modpost not to warn for these symbols in sym_add_exported.

Indeed; what I mean is that until then we will have to keep the
retpolines.  Not removing kvm_x86_ops leaves an unsustainable mess in
terms of maintainability, therefore we will need to first refactor the
code.  Once the refactoring is over, kvm_x86_ops can be dropped easily,
just like kvm_pmu_ops in this version of the series.

The good thing is that the modpost discussion can proceed in parallel.

Yes, the changes to remove tests and assignments to kvm_x86_ops must
happen first.  I understand that the big patch is a conflict magnet, but
once all the refactoring is done it will be very easy to review and it
will get in quickly.
