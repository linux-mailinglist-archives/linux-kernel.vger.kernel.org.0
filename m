The attached patch doesn't looks like it'd work for what we need,
although I wonder if it's easier to just check when cc-options is
defined for an environment variable or something and always return y
instead of calling out to $(CC) at all. Comes to the same thing, I
suppose.

No worries, it's a tough balancing act between upstream users and
distros. It's not caused me *that* much bother.

I believe it would solve our problem so from that perspective, it looks
good to me.
