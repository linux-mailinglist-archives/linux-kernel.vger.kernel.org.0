I've applied this whole series on top of my NWL work and it looks good
with a DSI panel. Applying the whole series also fixes an issue where
after unblank the output was sometimes shifted about half a screen width
to the right (which didn't happen with DCSS). So at least from the parts
I could test:

  Tested-by: Guido Günther <agx@sigxcpu.org> 

for the whole thing.
