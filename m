+ZONE_DEVICE
+===========
+The `ZONE_DEVICE` facility builds upon `SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP` to offer
+`struct page` `mem_map` services for device driver identified physical
+address ranges. The "device" aspect of `ZONE_DEVICE` relates to the fact
+that the page objects for these address ranges are never marked online,
+and that a reference must be taken against the device, not just the page
+to keep the memory pinned for active use. `ZONE_DEVICE`, via
+:c:func:`devm_memremap_pages`, performs just enough memory hotplug to
+turn on :c:func:`pfn_to_page`, :c:func:`page_to_pfn`, and
+:c:func:`get_user_pages` service for the given range of pfns. Since the
+page reference count never drops below 1 the page is never tracked as
+free memory and the page's `struct list_head lru` space is repurposed
+for back referencing to the host device / driver that mapped the memory.
+
+While `SPARSEMEM` presents memory as a collection of sections,
+optionally collected into memory blocks, `ZONE_DEVICE` users have a need
+for smaller granularity of populating the `mem_map`. Given that
+`ZONE_DEVICE` memory is never marked online it is subsequently never
+subject to its memory ranges being exposed through the sysfs memory
+hotplug api on memory block boundaries. The implementation relies on
+this lack of user-api constraint to allow sub-section sized memory
+ranges to be specified to :c:func:`arch_add_memory`, the top-half of
+memory hotplug. Sub-section support allows for `PMD_SIZE` as the minimum
+alignment granularity for :c:func:`devm_memremap_pages`.
+
+The users of `ZONE_DEVICE` are:
+* pmem: Map platform persistent memory to be used as a direct-I/O target
+  via DAX mappings.
+
+* hmm: Extend `ZONE_DEVICE` with `->page_fault()` and `->page_free()`
+  event callbacks to allow a device-driver to coordinate memory management
+  events related to device-memory, typically GPU memory. See
+  Documentation/vm/hmm.rst.
+
+* p2pdma: Create `struct page` objects to allow peer devices in a
+  PCI/-E topology to coordinate direct-DMA operations between themselves,
+  i.e. bypass host memory.
