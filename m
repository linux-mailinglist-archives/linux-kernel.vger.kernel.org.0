Hm, for the moment I mostly considered the custom ioasid allocator for
Intel platforms. On Arm platforms the SR-IOV model where each VM has its
own PASID space is still very much on the table. This would be the only
model supported by a vSMMU emulation for example, since the SMMU doesn't
have PASID allocation commands.

Yes. Some implementations have 8-bit ASIDs, but I think those would be
on embedded rather than server class platforms. And yes, if it wasn't
confusing enough, the Arm SMMU uses "SubstreamID" (SSID) for PASIDs :)

Thanks,
