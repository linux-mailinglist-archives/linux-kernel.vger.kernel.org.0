FWIW, from reading the Chrome OS code, I think the code you linked to isn't
where the breakage actually is.  I think it's actually at
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform2/+/refs/heads/master/chromeos-common-script/share/chromeos-common.sh#375
... where an init script is using the error message printed by 'e4crypt
get_policy' to decide whether to add -O encrypt to the filesystem or not.

It really should check instead:

	[ -e /sys/fs/ext4/features/encryption ]

Anyway, since something broke I think we need to revert the kernel patch anyway.
Ted, if you can provide an Acked-by, I can apply it to fscrypt.git#for-stable
and make a pull request for 5.4.
