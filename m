Subject: [PATCH] xhci: clear port_remote_wakeup after resume failure

This was seen on a Dell Precision 5520 using it's WD15 dock. The dock's
Ethernet device interfaces with the laptop through one of it's USB3
ports. While idle, the Ethernet device and HCD are suspended by runtime
PM, being the only device connected on the bus. Then, both are resumed on
behalf of the Ethernet device, which has remote wake-up capabilities.

The Ethernet device was observed to randomly disconnect from the USB
port shortly after submitting it's remote wake-up request. Probably a
weird timing issue yet to be investigated. This causes runtime PM to
busyloop causing some tangible CPU load. The reason is the port gets
stuck in the middle of a remote wake-up operation, waiting for the
device to switch to U0. This never happens, leaving "port_remote_wakeup"
enabled, and automatically triggering a failure on any further suspend
operation.

This patch clears "port_remote_wakeup" upon detecting a device with a
wrong resuming port state (see Table 4-9 in 4.15.2.3). Making sure the
above mentioned situation doesn't trigger a PM busyloop.
