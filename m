Hi,

lookig at this it seems to me that we are in danger of a deadlock

- during reset - devices cannot do IO while being reset
	covered by the USB layer in usb_reset_device
- resume & restore - devices cannot do IO while suspended
	covered by driver core in rpm_callback
- disconnect - a disconnected device cannot do IO
	is this a theoretical case or should I do something to
	the driver core?

How about changing configurations on USB?

	Regards
		Oliver
