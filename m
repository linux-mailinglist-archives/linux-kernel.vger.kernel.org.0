For this particular feature you really do not need any real NUMA server.
Your patch shouldn't introduce NUMA locality. All you are aiming for is
to optimize the zone list iteration.

Be aware that this will be quite time consuming and non-trivial to
process/evaluate. Not that I want to discourage you from this endeavor
but it is always good to think whether your final goal really has a
potential to a visible optimization. I might be wrong but only the page
allocator should really be the hot path which iterates over zonelist
so a microbenchmark targeting this path would be something I would start
with. Unless there are some really nice results from there I would lose
more time with other benchmarks.
