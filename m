I agree with that thought. One option would be, though, to put a proper
comment there to explain what happens in the code. Splitting the
functionality across several macros has the effect that the code feels
easier to reason about and has some implicit documentation through the
macro names. If we could restore that in Masahiro's version, I am ok
with that.

Matthias
