I converted this to a 'tip' block which looks better. If have different idea, please
comment.

.. tip::
  On Intel P6 family processors (Pentium Pro, Pentium II and later)
  the Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) may be used to control
  processor access to memory ranges. This is most useful when you have
  a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling write-combining
  allows bus write transfers to be combined into a larger transfer
  before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can increase performance
  of image write operations 2.5 times or more.

  The Cyrix 6x86, 6x86MX and M II processors have Address Range
  Registers (ARRs) which provide a similar functionality to MTRRs. For
  these, the ARRs are used to emulate the MTRRs.

  The AMD K6-2 (stepping 8 and above) and K6-3 processors have two
  MTRRs. These are supported.  The AMD Athlon family provide 8 Intel
  style MTRRs.

  The Centaur C6 (WinChip) has 8 MCRs, allowing write-combining. These
  are supported.

  The VIA Cyrix III and VIA C3 CPUs offer 8 Intel style MTRRs.

  The CONFIG_MTRR option creates a /proc/mtrr file which may be used
  to manipulate your MTRRs. Typically the X server should use
  this. This should have a reasonably generic interface so that
  similar control registers on other processors can be easily
  supported.
