After more investigation, I found I can not move the charger detection
into the charger driver.

Cause the USB phy will implement the USB charger support by
implementing phy->charger_detect() ops (which will call
sprd_pmic_detect_charger_type() to get the charger type), which means
the USB phy driver need to get a power supply object by a
'power-supply' phandle firstly, if we move the charger detection part
into the charger driver.

But our charger driver also need to register a USB phy notifier to be
notified how much current can be drawn from the USB charger framework,
which means the charger driver need to get a usb_phy object by a
'phys' phandle[1]. So this two drivers are interdependent and
dead-lock.

If we implement the charger type detection in the MFD, the USB phy
driver can get the PMIC device by a phandle easily to get the charger
type. Moreover from my previous description of the hardware design, I
still think implementing the charger type detection in the MFD driver
is a good way now.

What do you think? Thanks.
