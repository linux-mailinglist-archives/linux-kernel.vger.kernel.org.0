If you are talking about modules adding child devices of the device
they are managing, then that's handled correctly later in the series.

If you are talking about modules adding devices that aren't defined in
DT, then right, I'm not trying to handle that. The module needs to
make sure it keeps the resources needed for new devices it's adding
are in the right state or need to add the right device links.

I'll have to agree to disagree on that. While I understand that the
design should be good and I'm happy to work on that, you can't insist
that a patch series shouldn't be allowed because it's only improving
99% of the cases and leaves the other 1% in the status quo. You are
just going to bring the kernel development to a grinding halt.

Depends. If it's just more devices from DT, then it'll be fine. If
it's not, then the module needs to take care of the needs of devices
it's adding.

Out of the billions of Android devices, how many do you see this happening in?
