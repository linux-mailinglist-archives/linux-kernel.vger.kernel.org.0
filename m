Well, that one seems to do a similar yet a different kind of check. It
imposes a constrain to the alignment of the memory that is hotplugable
via add_memory_resource - aka memory with user visible sysfs interface
and that really has some restrictions on the memory block sizes now.

I do not really think we have to care about page unaligned addresses.
Callers down the road usually work with pfns.

yes, the patch has been rushed to Linus unfortunatelly. Although I do
not really see any reason why. Sigh...
Anyway, now that it is in Linus' tree then we can only do a follow up on
top.

It seems like a clear HW/platform bug to me. And that should better be
reported loudly to the log to make sure people do complain to their FW
friends and have it fixed.
