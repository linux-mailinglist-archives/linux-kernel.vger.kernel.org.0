No, worse IMO. It's not really a separate h/w block to make it a child
node. A single node can be multiple providers.

Ignoring issues with clocksources not being drivers, anything could be
an input capture provider whether DT provides that info or you just
have some API to register an input capture device. IOW, it could be
implicit in DT if you know you always want to expose the
functionality.

I would think VSYNC is slow enough you could just use a GPIO interrupt
unless it's 1 bad frame only and a small change in the timing.
