Unfortunately, Falkor is also an underlying micro-architecture, it just 
happens to be strongly related to Hydra so a fair amount of the errata 
affect both.

I don't want to be difficult.  For ultimate "correctness", Falkor and 
Hydra should probably be separate, however the Falkor architecture is 
not widespread and unlikely to have much churn going forward.  So I 
think if it makes life easier for you, all the Falkor stuff can probably 
be scrubbed and just merged into Hydra.
