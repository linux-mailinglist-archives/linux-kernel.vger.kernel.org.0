Ah, yes, good point. This doesn't happen on a complete overlap (current
usage), but I see what you meant now.

Actually, to fix this, it would be enough to move the assignment of
'keep' before the memmove(), or assign 'keep' from 'dst'.

I don't, I was just wondering about the reason behind your patch.

bitmap_set() and bitmap_clear() are conceptually in another class, I
think.

In any case, I agree that (map-wise) unary operations should naturally
not copy bitmaps, but I'm still not convinced that "fixing" this just
for bitmap_cut() is a good idea -- because of the inconsistency it adds.

How bad would it be to also adjust all usages of bitmap_{and,or,shift}
to behave in the same way?

If you keep the memmove(), then use bitmap_shift_right() on dst, some
excess bits will be affected, unless you copy them back from src...
which at that point, you don't have anymore.
