But why cannot you keep the reference count at 1 (do get_page when
offlining the page)? In other words as long as the driver knows the page
has been returned to the host then it has ref count at 1. Once the page
is returned to the guest for whatever reason it can free it to the
system by clearing the offline state and put_page.

An elevated ref count could help to detect that the memory hotremove is
not safe until the driver removes all potential metadata it might still
hold. You also know that memory online should skip such a page.

All in all your page is still in use by the driver and the life cycle is
controlled by that driver.

Or am I am missing something?
