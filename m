Subject: [for-next][PATCH 04/21] ring-buffer: Have ring_buffer_empty() not depend on tracing stopped

From: "Steven Rostedt (VMware)" <rostedt@goodmis.org>

It was complained about that when the trace file is read, that the tracing
is disabled, as the iterator expects writing to the buffer it reads is not
updated. Several steps are needed to make the iterator handle a writer,
by testing if things have changed as it reads.

This step is to make ring_buffer_empty() expect the buffer to be changing.
Note if the current location of the iterator is overwritten, then it will
return false as new data is being added. Note, that this means that data
will be skipped.
