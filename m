Then you need to somehow tie the revoke list that's in the psp to the
revoke list update logic we have. That's what we've done for hdcp2 (which
is similarly to yours implemented in hw). The point is that on linux we
now have a standard way to get these revoke lists updated/handled.

I guess it wasn't clear how exactly I think you're supposed to combine
them?
