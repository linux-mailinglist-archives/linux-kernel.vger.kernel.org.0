Right, think this has been taken care of at this time.

dont see any problems with the above two to. That leaves us with N_POSSIBLE.

Agree thats its better to make API's robust where possible.

If we dont allocate now, we would have to allocate them when we online the
nodes. To me it looks better to allocate as soon as the nodes are onlined,

Right.
