there is a fundamental dependency that you are ignoring: the module 
snd_soc_sst_bxt_rt298 is a machine driver which will be probed when 
snd_soc_skl creates a platform_device.
Sure you can remove modules in a different order, but that's a bit of an 
artificial/academic exercise isn't it?

Our tests remove the modules by taking care of dependencies and it's 
already unveiled dozens of issues.
We could add a sequence similar to Amadeusz and unbind the modules which 
are loaded with the creation of a platform_device (machine driver, 
dmic), I am just not sure how of useful this would be.
