Hi Doug,

To answer above points, yes in general it’s the understanding that wake is
almost always need to be equal to active. However, there can be valid reasons
for which the callers are enforced to call them differently in the first place.

At present caller send 3 types of request.
rpmh_write(RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE, addr=0x10, data=0x99);
rpmh_write(RPMH_SLEEP_STATE, addr=0x10, data=0x0);
rpmh_write(RPMH_WAKE_ONLY_STATE, addr=0x10, data=0x99);

Now, Lets assume we handle this in rpmh driver since wake=active and the caller
send only 2 type of request (lets call it active and sleep, since we have assumption
of wake=active, and we don’t want 3rd request as its handled in rpmh driver)
So callers will now invoke 2 types of request.

rpmh_write(RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE, addr=0x10, data=0x99);
rpmh_write(RPMH_SLEEP_STATE, addr=0x10, data=0x0);

with first type request, it now needs to serve 2 purpose
(a)    cache ACTIVE request votes as WAKE votes
(b)    trigger it out immediately (in ACTIVE TCS) as it need to be also complete immediately.

For SLEEP, nothing changes. Now when entering to sleep we do rpmh_flush() to program all
WAKE and SLEEP request…so far so good…

Now consider a corner case,

There is something called a solver mode in RSC where HW could be in autonomous mode executing
low power modes. For this it may want to “only” program WAKE and SLEEP votes and then controller
would be in solver mode entering and exiting sleep autonomously.

There is no ACTIVE set request and hence no requirement to send it right away as ACTIVE vote.

If we have only 2 type of request, caller again need to differentiate to tell rpmh driver that
when it invoke

rpmh_write(RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE, addr=0x10, data=0x99);

with this caching it as WAKE is fine  ((a) in above) but do not trigger it ((b) in above)

so we need to again modify this API and pass another argument saying whether to do (a + b) or only (a).
but caller can already differentiate by using RPMH_ACTIVE_ONLY_STATE or RPMH_WAKE_ONLY_STATE.

i think at least for now, leave it as it is, unless we really see any impact by caller invoking all
3 types of request and take in account all such corner cases before i make any such change.
we can take it separate if needed along with optimization pointed in v9 series discussions.

Thanks,  this seems good. v11 on the way.
