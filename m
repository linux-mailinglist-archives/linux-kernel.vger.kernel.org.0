Hmm.  VM_SPECIAL is this:

  #define VM_SPECIAL (VM_IO | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_PFNMAP | VM_MIXEDMAP)

Requiring VM_DONTEXPAND makes sense for sure.  Dunno about the other
ones.  For drm_gem_vram_helper VM_IO + VM_PFNMAP are needed.

But we also have drm_gem_shmem_helper which backs objects with normal
pages.  In fact drm_gem_shmem_mmap does this:

	/* VM_PFNMAP was set by drm_gem_mmap() */
	vma->vm_flags &= ~VM_PFNMAP;
	vma->vm_flags |= VM_MIXEDMAP;

include/linux/mm.h isn't very helpful in explaining how VM_MIXEDMAP
should be used, only saying can be both "struct page" and pfnmap, so I'm
not sure why VM_MIXEDMAP is set here, it should always be "struct page"
for shmem, no?

cheers,
  Gerd
