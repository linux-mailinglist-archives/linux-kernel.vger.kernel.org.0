Hi,

Looks very nice! Some questions/comments below:

> Depends on Constructor support in UML and is based off of
> "[RFC PATCH] um: implement CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS for modules"
> (https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1234551/) 

I guess I should resend this as a proper patch then. Did you test
modules? I can try (later) too.

> The location of the KASAN shadow memory, starting at
> KASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET, can be configured using the

That also means if I have say 512MB memory allocated for UML, KASAN will
use an *additional* 64, unlike on a "real" system, where KASAN will take
about 1/8th of the available physical memory, right?

Maybe that should say "mapped" instead of "initialized", since there are
relatively few machines on which it could actually all all be used?

So that's actually something to fix still? Just trying to understand,
I'll test it later.

Heh, you *actually* based it on my patch, in git terms, not just in code
terms. I think you should just pick up the few lines that you need from
that patch and squash them into this one, I just posted that to
demonstrate more clearly what I meant :-)

I think the () shouldn't be there?

If that fails, can we even continue?
