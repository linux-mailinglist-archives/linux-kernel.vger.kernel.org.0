Hmm, one thought might be GRND_FAILSAFE, which will wait up to two
minutes before returning "best efforts" randomness and issuing a huge
massive warning if it is triggered?

For the MIT Magic Cookie, it might as well use GRND_NONBLOCK, and if
it fails due to randomness being not available, it should just fall
back to random_r(3).  Or heck, just use random_r(3) all the time,
since it's not at all secure anyway....

That makes it systemd's responsibility to properly manage the random
seed file, and if the random seed file gets imaged, or if it gets read
while the system is off, that's on systemd....   which is fine.

The real problem here is that we're trying to engineer a system which
makes it safe for real cryptographic systems, but there's no way to
distinguish between real cryptographic systems where proper entropy is
critical and pretend security systems like X.org's MIT Magic Cookie
--- or python trying to get random numbers seeding its dictionary hash
tables to avoid DOS attacks when python is used for CGI scripts ---
but guess what happens when python is used for systemd generator
scripts in early boot.... before the random seed file might even be
mounted?  In that case, python reverted to using /dev/urandom, which
was probably the right choice --- it didn't *need* to use getrandom.

Does the attach patch (see below) help?

A kernel printk will make it easier for people to understand why their
system is hung, in any case --- and which process is to blame.  So
that's definitely a good thing.
