Like I alluded to above, matching on "riscv,clint0" seems reasonable to me as 
it's a defacto standard -- we'll just have to make sure that if we ever end up 
with a RISC-V CLINT that the DT entry is something else.

As far as splitting the memory maps goes, I don't have a strong opinion but it 
seems like that'll introduce more complexity than it's worth.
