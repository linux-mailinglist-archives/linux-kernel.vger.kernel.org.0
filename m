Sorry, I know from many arm contributions that using a .dtsi is the
right thing here. It logically separates the chip from the board, even
if there's only one evaluation board currently. Think about set-top
boxes that someone might author a .dts for - they should be able to
reuse the .dtsi for the SoC rather than copy it.

Thanks for that pointer! I still think my node names are cleaner and
also the structure of keeping clocks and gpio users outside of /soc. I
see the value you use is 27 MHz, will try it tomorrow. I see you use
nice KEY_ constants, whereas I just took the raw values from the dtb.

I notice that your patch doesn't have any Copyright header, how should I
credit you in the resulting combined patch? I would then also add your
SoB from the patch you linked to.

More comments inline...

I forgot to align the numbering here. The label matches the GPIO and
what is printed on the board.

This green one stops blinking and stays on.

This red one keeps blinking after the panic.

These two remain off. So I wonder whether the GPIO polarity is wrong?
In the example usb.img the gpio-leds module is not loaded by default, so
maybe it wasn't noticed before?

Also, many arm boards use more complex LED labels with multiple parts
separated by colon, like "boardname:name:function" or so.

The reason I left out the compatible for the SoC/board is that it looks
unclean to me that you're using a "csky," vendor prefix for interrupt
controller and timer instead of a new "nationalchip," prefix for the SoC
vendor. Did I miss some reasoning for that, or did that slip through
patch review?

Being the first board we'd need to create a new YAML file to document
them, I assume. Not sure what the best scope (=name) would be here.

Here's the other SoC compatible.
