Agreed, for rcu_assign_pointer(), there were only a couple, and I checked
them as well.  Doesn't mean I didn't miss something, of course!

I also got an offlist report of rcu_assign_pointer() not working for
pointers to incomplete structures.  Which can be fixed by removing
the RCU_INITIALIZER() from the second argument of the smp_store_release().
Which destroys sparse's ability to check for __rcu.

One approach would be to have a separate rcu_assign_pointer_opaque()
for opaque pointers, and people would just ignore the sparse warnings.

Other suggestions?

							Thanx, Paul
