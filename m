One example where the lack of READ_ONCE() makes me uneasy is found
in drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/trans.c: iwl_pcie_set_interrupt_capa():

static void iwl_pcie_set_interrupt_capa(struct pci_dev *pdev,
                                        struct iwl_trans *trans)
{
        struct iwl_trans_pcie *trans_pcie = IWL_TRANS_GET_PCIE_TRANS(trans);
        int max_irqs, num_irqs, i, ret;
[...]
        max_irqs = min_t(u32, num_online_cpus() + 2, IWL_MAX_RX_HW_QUEUES);
        for (i = 0; i < max_irqs; i++)
                trans_pcie->msix_entries[i].entry = i;

max_entries is an array of IWL_MAX_RX_HW_QUEUES entries. AFAIU, if the compiler
decides to re-fetch num_online_cpus() for the loop condition after hot-plugging
of a few cpus, we end up doing an out-of bound access to the array.

The scenario would be:

- load __num_online_cpus into a register,
- compare register + 2 to IWL_MAX_RX_HW_QUEUES
  (let's say the current number of cpus is lower that IWL_MAX_RX_HW_QUEUES - 2)
- a few other cpus are brought online,
- compiler decides to re-fetch __num_online_cpus for the loop bound, because
  its value is rightfully assumed to have never changed,
- corruption and sadness follows.

I'm not saying the current compiler implementations actually generate this
for this specific function, but I'm concerned about the fact that they are
within their right to do so. It seems quite fragile to expose a kernel API
which can yield to this kind of subtle bug.

A quick kernel tree grep for both "num_online_cpus" and "min" on the same line
gives 64 results, so it's not an isolated case.

Thanks,

Mathieu
