This would work, the problem would be that you lose the link to the
actual USB port.
On these Wilco devices, only one port supports this, and I don't think we really
care about exposing which one it is, but theoretically you would want
to be able to
control this for individual ports. I talked with Duncan today and he
will tweak the
BIOS firmware so that it exposes which USB ports support the PowerShare ability.
Then we can query this configuration via ACPI.

I hadn't seen that driver before, it looks very new, but looks quite
similar. One problem
is that the standard power_supply properties represent the present
status of the device,
whereas we want to control the state when the device is off.

I think that I will write this up as a power_supply driver and see
what people think. As
a fallback, we can look more into the USB subsystem. Greg, do you think that is
acceptable, or would you really like this within the USB subsystem?
