Ok, I was familiar with that diagram, but I was trying to fit it into
how the other architectures where I have done this type of work.  This
is a little bizarre to me, but I understand now.  Your explaination was
very helpful, though the code I have is correct either way.

The problem is that kgdb doesn't work right with the current
implementation.  If you continue from a breakpoint, it does not
continue.  It just stops at the same place.  What happens is:

* gdb remove the breakpoint and single steps.
* An exception happens and the single step stops in the kernel entry.
  Thus the state machine goes to inactive.
* gdb re-inserts the breakpoint and continues.
* When the exception returns, the breakpoint is there and is hit again.

You can never continue from a breakpoint without removing it, because
there's alway a timer interrupt pending.  You can't single-step through
instructions (stepi) because it always stops in the kernel entry.  If
you do a normal gdb single step in code it just hangs because it keeps
trying to single step through instructions and keeps stopping in kernel
entry.  So gdb does not expect the behavior that is currently
implemented.

The patch as I have posted it is probably the simplest way to fix it.
It basically makes single-step work like other architectures, and like
the userspace single step works.  I could ifdef it so that the entry
code is only there if kgdb is enabled.  You can single step through
instructions that cause page faults, so it's a little more general.

The other way is to run the single-stepped instruction with interrupts
disabled and emulate any messing with the DAIF bits.  I assume
that's only "MRS <Xt>, DAIF", "MSR DAIF, <Xt>", "MSR DAIFSet, #<imm>",
and "MSR DAIFClr, #<imm>".  Well, I guess ERET also does that, but maybe
that's ok, probably not a big deal.  In this case you can't single step
over instructions that take page faults.  I'm not sure if that's a big
deal or not, but I assume users would do that.  And it's more complex
since you have to emulate those instructions messing with DAIF.

I would like to get this fixed, either way.

Thanks,
