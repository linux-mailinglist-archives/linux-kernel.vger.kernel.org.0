I've just tried to reproduce the "Error i2c_dw_xfer call while suspended" error
on suspend/resume on my own T100TA and I could not reproduce this.

Can you try without the BT keyboard paired and waking up from suspend using the
tablet part's power-button ?

Also do you still have the scripts to rmmod some modules before suspend ?

s2idle is the normal / expected suspend condition on these tablet devices.

As for how much energy is consumed during suspend, the device should use
S0i3 and then you should get ok (so not great, but also not too much) power
consumption during suspend:

[root@dhcp-43-189 ~]# cat /sys/kernel/debug/pmc_atom/sleep_state
S0IR Residency: 156256us
S0I1 Residency: 3968us
S0I2 Residency: 0us
S0I3 Residency: 70557440us
S0   Residency: 11826052384us

After being suspended for a couple of seconds, you should see a significant
(large) value in S0I3 like above.

Regards,

Hans
