Yes, this is what I was mentioned in initial version, since the "dsi"
gate in tcon top is registering during bind, the dphy of dsi
controller won't get the associated clock for "mod" so it is keep on
returning -EPROBE_DEFER. By moving the clock gate registration to
probe, everything bound as expected.
