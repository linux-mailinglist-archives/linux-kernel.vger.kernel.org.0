This patch set adds support for TPM devices that implement the I2C.
Interface defined by TCG PTP specification:
https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_PC_Client_Platform_TPM_Profile_PTP_2.0_r1.03_v22.pdf

The driver was tested on Raspberry-Pie 3, using Nuvoton NPCT75X TPM.

Interrupts are not implemented yet, preparing it for the next patch.
This patch is based on initial work by oshri Alkoby, Alexander Steffen and Christophe Ricard

Changes since version 1:
-"char:tpm:Add check_data handle to tpm_tis_phy_ops in order to check data integrity"
        - Fixed and extended commit description.
        - Fixed an issue regarding handling max retries.
-"dt-bindings: tpm: Add YAML schema for TPM TIS I2C options":
        -Converted "tpm_tis_i2c.txt" to "tpm-tis-i2c.yaml".
        - Renamed "tpm_tis-i2c" to "tpm-tis-i2c".
        - Removed interrupts properties.
-"char: tpm: add tpm_tis_i2c driver"
        - Replaced "tpm_tis-i2c" with "tpm-tis-i2c" in "tpm_tis_i2c.c".
