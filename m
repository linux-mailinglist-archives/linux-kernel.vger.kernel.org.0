Bindings are for h/w, not a driver.

Perhaps 'dt-bindings: clock: ...' to give a bit more clue what this is 
in the subject.

More indentation on the continued lines would help readability.

I'm not too sure about this one. Seems like if you have child nodes, 
then you should re-program. If you don't then you don't re-program.

With a reg property, you should have a unit address.
