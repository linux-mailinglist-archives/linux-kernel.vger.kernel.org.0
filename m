Those two examples are probably the worst examples to ever look at :)

The code quality of those submissions was horrible, gma500 took a very
long time to clean up and there are parts of the android code that are
still in staging to this day.

That is the normal process, staging should not be needed at all for any
code.  It is a fall-back for when the company involved has no idea of
how to upstream their code, which should NOT be the case here.
