I will put some more prints and let you know. But it looks like I see a print
from rcu_sched_clock_irq() only once at around 700ms from the start of the
test loop. After that I don't see prints at all for the rest of the 7 seconds
of the test.

Before the test starts, I see several rcu_sched_clock_irq() at the regular
tick interval of 1 ms (HZ=1000).

Ok will do.

True, forseeing is always better ;)
