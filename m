Yes.
Do not take it as 100% true as I read that in some code/Documentation
a while ago.

But I think that it boils down to:

soft-offline: "We have seen some erros in the underlying page, but
               it is still usable, so we have a chance to keep the
               the contents (via migration)"
hard-offline: "The underlying page is dead, we cannot trust it, so
               we shut it down, killing whoever is holding it
               along the way".

Am I wrong Naoya?
