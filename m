I don't see what's wrong in my tone above, I'm sorry if it can be
perceived as such. My point was that things such as creating lifetime
keys while there's no entropy is the wrong thing to do and what
progressively led to this situation.

But with this EINVAL you have the information that it only filled
the buffer with whatever it could, right ? At least that was the
last point I manage to catch in the discussion. Otherwise if it's
totally silent, I fear that it will reintroduce the problem in a
different form (i.e. libc will say "our randoms are not reliable
anymore, let us work around this and produce blocking, solid randoms
again to help all our users").

Then I am confused because I understood that the goal was to return
EINVAL or anything equivalent in which case the userspace knows what
it has to deal with :-/
