Hi Bean,

Just want to add up more phrases. We do have HW/SW reset.
Sorry about below lines which make you confused. Here I am just 
describing what
is like with previous code. Since these pending requests does not have
a chance to be handled in their IRQ handler after hba is stopped, and as
they have been cleared from doorbell already, then once there is an 
available
transfer completion IRQ, these requests will be handled in the IRQ 
handler,
no matter what is the transfer completion IRQ fired for. And NOP_OUT is 
just
the first command that can fire a transer completion IRQ.

Can Guo.

These pending requests shall be completed along with the first NOP_OUT
command(as it is the first command which can raise a transfer completion
IRQ) sent during probe.
