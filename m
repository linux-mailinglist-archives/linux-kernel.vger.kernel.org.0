Following up on this I hit another in rt.c which looks like:

[  156.348854] Call Trace:
[  156.351301]  <IRQ>
[  156.353322]  sched_rt_period_timer+0x124/0x350

It looks like the same issue of not using the rq_lock* wrappers and
hence not using the pinning. From looking at the code there is at 
least one potential hit in deadline.c in the push_dl_task path with 
find_lock_later_rq but I have not hit that in practice.

This commit, which introduced the warning, seems to imply that the use
of the rq_lock* wrappers is required, at least for any sections that will
call update_rq_clock:

commit 26ae58d23b94a075ae724fd18783a3773131cfbc
Author: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 3 16:53:49 2016 +0200

    sched/core: Add WARNING for multiple update_rq_clock() calls
    
    Now that we have no missing calls, add a warning to find multiple
    calls.
    
    By having only a single update_rq_clock() call per rq-lock section,
    the section appears 'atomic' wrt time.


Is that the case? Otherwise we have these false positives.

I can spin up patches if so. 


Thanks,
Phil
