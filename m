Alas I don't have one. But it can be done by other kernel users at rc-s stage
of the next kernel release.

Yes. It's a case of optional clock. Have a look at how the clock API
works. You are already using it here in this driver when calling
clk_prepare_enable()/clk_disable_unprepare().

That's what I did by the comment: "... second the tty/serial subsystem knows
the actual reference clock rate of the port." If you think, that checking a
return value and undoing things in case of an error need elaboration in a
comment I'll do it in v3.
