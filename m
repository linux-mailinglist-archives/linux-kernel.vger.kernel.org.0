Cool, that works nicely and I tested it. Actually I made it such that we
don't need to batch even, before the scheduler is up. I don't see any benefit
of that unless we can see a kfree_rcu() flood happening that early at boot
which seems highly doubtful as a real world case.

And it would also need this complexity of early_initcall.

Sure. Skipping batching would skip the timer too :-D

If in the future, batching is needed this early, then I am happy to add an
early_initcall to setup the timer for any batched calls that could not setup
the timer. Hope that is ok with you?

thanks,
