Oh, if we want to FG_GC only migrate on segment on time, it needs to change
has_not_enough_free_secs() condition as well, so previous logic is broken.

Agreed, I guess SMR scenario may need such policy: higher trigger frequency on bggc
when free space decreases, but less block migration for each bggc cycle.
