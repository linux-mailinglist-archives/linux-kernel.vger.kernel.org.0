So I think people nowadays prefer getrandom() over /dev/urandom
primarily because of the noisy logging the kernel does when you use
the latter on a non-initialized pool. If that'd be dropped then I am
pretty sure that the porting from /dev/urandom to getrandom() you see
in various projects (such as gdm/x11) would probably not take place.

In fact, speaking for systemd: the noisy logging in the kernel is the
primary (actually: only) reason that we prefer using RDRAND (if
available) over /dev/urandom if we need "medium quality" random
numbers, for example to seed hash tables and such. If the log message
wasn't there we wouldn't be tempted to bother with RDRAND and would
just use /dev/urandom like we used to for that.

Well, but as mentioned, there's infrastructure for this, that's why I
suggested changing systemd-random-seed.service.

We can make boot hang in "sane", discoverable way.

The reason why I think this should also be logged by the kernel since
people use netconsole and pstore and whatnot and they should see this
there. If systemd with its infrastructure brings this to screen via
plymouth then this wouldn't help people who debug much more low-level.

(I mean, there have been requests to add a logic to systemd that
refuses booting — or delays it — if the system has a battery and it is
nearly empty. I am pretty sure adding a cleanm discoverable concept of
"uh, i can't boot for a good reason which is this" wouldn't be the
worst of ideas)
