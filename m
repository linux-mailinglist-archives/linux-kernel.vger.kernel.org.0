Looking at the documentation link that Marco kindly provided, I don't
think ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_BITS is the correct annotation to make.  The bits
in question are being accessed in parallel, it's just that we're willing
to accept a certain degree of inaccuracy.

I require the following properties from this array of bits:

 - If a bit was set before and after the modification, it must be seen to
   be set.
 - If a bit was clear before and after the modification, it must be seen to
   be clear.
 - If a bit is modified, it may be seen as set or clear.

I have found three locations where we use the ->marks array:

1.
                        unsigned long data = *addr & (~0UL << offset);
                        if (data)
                                return __ffs(data);

2.
        return find_next_bit(addr, XA_CHUNK_SIZE, offset);
3.
        return test_bit(offset, node_marks(node, mark));

The modifications -- all done with the spinlock held -- use the non-atomic
bitops:
        return __test_and_set_bit(offset, node_marks(node, mark));
        return __test_and_clear_bit(offset, node_marks(node, mark));
        bitmap_fill(node_marks(node, mark), XA_CHUNK_SIZE);
(that last one doesn't really count -- it's done prior to placing the node
in the tree)

The first read seems straightforward; I can place a READ_ONCE around
*addr.  The second & third reads are rather less straightforward.
find_next_bit() and test_bit() are common code and use plain loads today.

I don't know ... my preferred form of exercise takes me into the
harm's way of cars, so while I've significantly lowered my risk of
dying of cardiovascular disease, I'm much more likely to be killed by
an inattentive human being!  Bring on our robot cars ...
