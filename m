Hi Peter,
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I understand your point and I tend
to agree with it. I originally designed this using watchdog as the
example of a critical system health signal and in the context of
mobile device memory pressure is critical but I agree that there are
more important things in life. I checked and your proposal to change
it to FIFO-1 should still work for our purposes. Will test to make
sure and reply to your patch. Couple clarifications in-line.

This signal is used not to protect other RT tasks but to monitor
overall system memory health for the sake of system responsiveness.

IMHO an opt-in feature stops being "stupid" as soon as the user opted
in to use it, therefore explicitly indicating interest in it. However
I assume you are using "stupid" here to indicate that it's "less
important" rather than it's "useless".

Thanks for posting the fix.
