And I completely tired to repeat that this is okay and does not prevent you to
use MFD.

Which is right thing to do. Requesting resources should be done by their actual
user, no?

Moreover, if you look at /proc/iomem, for example, I bet there will be
a difference with your proposed method and a established one.

MFD has nothing to do with *requesting* resource. It's about *slicing* them.
*Requesting* resource is orthogonal to the *slicing*.

I stopped here. Let's discuss an actual code.
