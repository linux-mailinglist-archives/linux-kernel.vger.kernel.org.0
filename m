I think the documentation says it does when wakeup_events is 1. The code =
for
perf backs this up:
=
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/a9815a4fa2fd297cab9fa7a12161b166572=
90293/tools/perf/util/evsel.c#L1051-L1054
The puzzle is what happens when wakeup_events is 0. The documentation =
saying
"more recent kernels treat 0 the same as 1" suggests it should behave =
the same,
but then why would perf set it to 1 after zero-initializing it?

It=E2=80=99s 512 KiB. Each sample is 40 bytes (the sample_type is IP | =
TID | TIME |
PERIOD, and each one of those 8 bytes). 40 bytes per sample * 4000 =
samples per
second * 1.637 seconds is 261920 which is almost exactly half the =
buffer.

So does wakeup_events =3D 0 means it causes a wakeup when the buffer is =
half
full? I don't see anything in the man page about this....

If you'd like to try yourself, this is the strace command I've been =
using:
strace -ttTv -eperf_event_open,mmap,poll -operf.strace perf record =
stress --cpu 1 --timeout 1
