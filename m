This comes down to pretty coarse time resolution, does it not? More
often than not, the time difference shown will be 0. I'd recommend at
least millisecond resolution.

This is certainly helpful in some situations. Yet I am unsure if it
should *always* be printed. I wouldn't say it's as important as the 
other stuff scsi_print_result() provides. After all, by activating
MLQUEUE+MLCOMPLETE, the time on-wire can be extracted with better
accuracy from currently available logs. 

So perhaps make this depend on a module parameter?

Also, we should carefully ponder if we want to put this on the same
line as the driver byte, as users may have created scripts for parsing
this output.

Martin
