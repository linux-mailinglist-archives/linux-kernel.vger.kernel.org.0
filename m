Perhaps I'm just getting confused pre-morning-coffee, but I thought the
original complaint (and the reason for this patch even existing) was that
when many CPUs were hammering the lockref then performance tanked? In which
case, increasing the threshold as the number of CPUs increases seems
counter-intuitive to me because it suggests that the larger the system,
the harder we should try to make the cmpxchg work.
