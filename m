Except that smp_send_reschedule() won't do anything unless the scheduler
things something needs to be done, as it its wake list is non-empty.
Which might explain why Peter Zijlstra didn't suggest it.

4. If further testing continues to show it to be reliable, continue
using the scheme in -rcu.
5. Use a short-duration hrtimer to get a clean environment in short
order.  Yes, the timer might fire while preemption and/or softirqs
are disabled, but then the code can rely on the following
preempt_enable(), local_bh_enable(), or whatever.  This condition
should be sufficiently rare to avoid issues with hrtimer overhead.
6. Use smp_call_function_single() to IPI some other poor slob of a
CPU, which then does the same back.  Non-waiting version in both
cases, of course.

Probably others as well.

OK, good to hear.  As you may have noticed, I was getting the impression
that you might have changed your mind on this point.  ;-)

Steve Rostedt's point about enlisting the aid of lockdep seems worth
looking into.
