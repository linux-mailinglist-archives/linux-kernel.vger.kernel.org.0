Sorry for the delay in the response.

Yes, I agree. The purpose of the v2 version of the patchset was to try 
and quickly address Matthew's concerns. This version of the patchset:
* is not using any EFI configs
* is not exposing secure variables via efivarfs
* is based on Greg's suggestion to use sysfs
* is STILL using some of the existing EFI code, that is used by EFI to 
expose its variables via sysfs, to avoid code duplication.
* is using efivar hooks to expose secure variables for tool compatibility

Assuming we all are in agreement, the next version of this patchset will 
further improve upon these changes. It will refactor some of the sysfs 
code from drivers/firmware/efi that is common to both EFI and POWER.  
Since we do not have to emulate the complex semantics of efi on powerpc, 
the sysfs interface should work for us.

As per the tool, it will be efivar. I will provide the log demonstrating 
how it is used with the next version.

Is there something I missed in my understanding ?

Thanks & Regards,
