The correct answer will be different in different situations.
For example, code that might be called either with the mutex held or
within an RCU read-side critical section will definitely need the _rcu()
and the lockdep_is_held().  Code that looks OK to call from within
RCU readers, but must not be (e.g., because it sleeps), will just as
definitely need to avoid _rcu().  (If the lack of _rcu() proves confusing,
maybe list_for_each_entry() needs to grow an optional lockdep expression?)

I am therefore personally OK with either approach, though in confusing
cases a comment might help.

Good point.

RCU readers don't need _safe() because RCU grace periods provide this
for free within RCU read-side critical sections.

So agreed, if you need _safe() on the update side, you would need to
call list_for_each_entry_safe().  If this proves confusing due to RCU
readers, maybe it should grow a lockdep expression?  In the meantime,
lockdep_assert_held() could be used if needed to let people know that
this should not be used in an RCU reader.

Does that work, or am I missing part of the problem?

							Thanx, Paul
