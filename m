Ah, that is my mistake: I was getting dynamic libbpf symbols with this
approach, but that was because I had the version of libbpf.so in my
$LIBDIR that had the patch to expose the netlink APIs as versioned
symbols; so it was just pulling in everything from the shared library.

So what I was going for was exactly what you described above; but it
seems that doesn't actually work. Too bad, and sorry for wasting your
time on this :/
