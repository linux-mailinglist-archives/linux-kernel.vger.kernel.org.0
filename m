It's not only the APIC state. It's the state of the CPUs in general.

Fair enough for the IPI case.

It can and it does.

That's the whole point why we bring up all CPUs in the 'nosmt' case and
shut the siblings down again after setting CR4.MCE. Actually that's in fact
a 'let's hope no MCE hits before that happened' approach, but that's all we
can do.

If we don't do that then the MCE broadcast can hit a CPU which has some
firmware initialized state. The result can be a full system lockup, triple
fault etc.

So when the MCE hits a CPU which is still in the crashed kernel lala state,
then all hell breaks lose.

Anything less than the actual number of present CPUs is problematic except
you use the 'let's hope nothing happens' approach. We could add an option
to stop the bringup at the early online state similar to what we do for
'nosmt'.
