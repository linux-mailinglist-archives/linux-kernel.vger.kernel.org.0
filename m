OK, I just wanted to eliminate any other possibility, just in case.

You do not need to parse denali_setup_data_interface().


There are good hints.

You said:
"The last kernel i am able to boot is 4.19.10. I have tried booting:
5.1.21, 5.2.9, 5.3-rc8, 5.4.5-rt3 and 5.5-rc5. They all failed."

There is no commit between 4.19.10 and 5.1.21
that changes denali_setup_data_interface().

So, denali_setup_data_interface() is not the
root cause.


From the information you provided,
I suspect some clock settings are wrong.

Most of NAND flashes, but not all.

See the "Bad Block Location" in this page:

http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/nand-data/nanddata.html



Many of devices have BBM at 1st byte/word,
but there are devices that have it at 6th byte.

SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES=2 for SOCFPGA
corrupts the BBM at offset 6.
So, probably such a device is not used
on SOCFPGA boards.

I am guessing that is why the UniPhier platform
adopted SPARE_AREA_SKIP_BYTES=8.
