I was testing with 5.4-rc1 which contains the indicated RTS fix.

Yes, CTS/RTS are connected on the Lenovo Miix 630.

I added debug statements which indicated that data was received,
however it was corrupt, and the packet type did not match what was
expected, hence the frame reassembly errors.

In response to this patch, Balakrishna pointed me to a bug report
which indicated that some of the UART GPIO lines need to have a bias
applied to prevent errant data from floating lines -

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/1391888

It turns out this fix was never applied to msm8998.  Applying the fix
does cause the the frame reassembly errors to go away, however then
the host SoC never receives the baud rate change response (I increased
the timeout from 2faa3f15fa2f ("Bluetooth: hci_qca: wcn3990: Drop
baudrate change vendor event") to 5 seconds).  As of now, this patch
is still required.

I have no idea why the delay is required, and was hoping that posting
this patch would result in someone else providing some missing pieces
to determine the real root cause.  I suspect that asserting RTS at the
wrong time may cause an issue for the wcn3990, but I have no data nor
documentation to support this guess.  I welcome any further insights
you may have.
