Restrict kdump to only reserve crashkernel below 64TB.

The reaons is that the kdump may jump from 5-level to 4-level, and if
the kdump kernel is put above 64TB, then the jumping will fail. While the
1st kernel reserves crashkernel region during bootup, we don't know yet
which kind of kernel will be loaded after system bootup, 5-level kernel
or 4-level kernel.
