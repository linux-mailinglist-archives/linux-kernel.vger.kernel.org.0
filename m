Subject: [PATCH 0/6] STM32 DT: Updates for SOC diversity

This series updates stm32mp device tree files in order to handle the STM32MP15
part numbers diversity. STM32MP15 part numbers are built in this way:

-STM32MP15X: X = [1, 3, 7] for IPs diversity:
 -STM32MP151 = basic part
 -STM32MP153 = STM32MP153  + a second CPU A7 + MCAN(x2)
 -STM32MP157 = STM32MP153 + DSI + GPU

-STMM32MP15xY: Y = [a, c] for security diversity:
 -STM32MP15xA: basic part.
 -STM32MP15xC: adds crypto IP.

-STM32MP15xxZZ: ZZ = [aa, ab, ac, ad] for packages (IO) diversity:
 -STM32MP15xxAA: TFBGA448 18x18
 -STM32MP15xxAB: LFBGA354 16x16
 -STM32MP15xxAC: TFBGA361 12x12
 -STM32MP15xxAD: TFBGA257 10x10

New device tree files are created and some existing are renamed to match with
this split.

In this way it is easy to assemble (by inclusion) those files to match with the
SOC partnumber used on board, and then it's simpler for users to create their
own device tree board file using the correct SOC.

For more details:
