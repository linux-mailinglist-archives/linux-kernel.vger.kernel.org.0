I think SMC mailbox as mostly unidirectional/Tx only channel. And the
interrupts here as stated are for notifications, so I prefer to keep
them separate channel. I assume SMC call return indicates completion.
Or do you plan to use these interrupts as the indication for completion
of the command? I see in patch 2/2 the absence of IRQ is anyway dealt
the way I mention above.

Does it make sense or am I missing something here ?
