I'm not sure this only happens in panics (I'm honestly not sure at all
why we're complaining about offline cpus). But in general I've seen
piles of dying systems that dump WARNINGS and then eventually panic.
Still would be good to not have a pointless lockdep splat in between.

Hm yeah this sounds like another fix which would stop things from
getting worse when the machine is dying. I can try and stuff this (or
something like this, I honestly have no idea about cpu handling code
so no idea what's reasonable) into our CI and see what happens.

Thanks, Daniel
