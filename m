Ick ick ick, we don't like #ifdefs in .c files for a reason :)

Sure, that's safe, but don't try to change what I originally said about
writing to random /dev/mem addresses please.

It's as if you want a memory/platform type to be a "fuzz target", right?
You aren't going to go around and try to put the above crazyness into
each and every spot in the kernel that wants to write to a
user-specified address.

Fuzzing the kernel is great, but remember it's a means to an end, that
of trying to ensure that the kernel has less bugs than before.  Forcing
the kernel to adapt a memory model that is not what it "normally" uses
kind of goes against your main goal here, right?

And have you all really run out of apis that are all now bug free that
you are going after these types of ones?

thanks,
