Hi Andrey,

We ever tried to use object itself to determine use-after-free
identification, but tag-based KASAN immediately released the pointer
after call kfree(), the original object will be used by another
pointer, if we use object itself to determine use-after-free issue, then
it has many false negative cases. so we create a lite quarantine(ring
buffers) to record recent free stacks in order to avoid those false
negative situations.

We hope to have one solution to cover all cases and be accurate. Our
patch is configurable feature option, it can provide some programmers to
easy see the tag-based KASAN report.

Thanks your information, it looks like the same idea with our patch.
