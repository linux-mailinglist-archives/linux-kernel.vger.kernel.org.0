I'm open to other names, but of_supplier_depend is just odd.
of_devlink stands for of_device_links. If someone wants to know what
device links do, they can read up on the device links documentation?

We are creating device links between devices. Not device tree nodes.
So this would be wrong. I'll replace it with "devicetree nodes" with
"devices"?

I like this part. How about clarifying it with "from scanning the
common bindings in the devicetree"? Because we aren't trying to scan
the device specific properties.

A driver is never probed. It's a device that's probed. The dependency
is between devices and not drivers. So, how about I replace this with:
"The consumer device will not be probed until all of its supplier
devices are successfully probed"?

Also, any reason you removed the "resources aren't turned off ..."
part? That's one of the biggest improvements of this patch series. Do
you want to rewrite that part too? Or I'll leave my current wording of
that part as is?

I thought about that when I wrote the code. But the consumer being the
ancestor of the supplier is just one of the things that makes a link
invalid. There can be other tests we might add as we go. That's why I
kept the function name as of_link_is_valid(). Even if I add an
"ancestor_of" helper function, I'll still have of_link_is_valid() as a
wrapper around it.

If you do insist on this change, I think we need better names than
test_np and np. It's not clear which node needs to be the ancestor for
this function to return true. With consumer/supplier, it's kinda
obvious that a consumer can't be an ancestor of a supplier.

Could you suggest something that makes it a bit more clear that this
phandle/node doesn't need to be an actual device (as in, one with
compatible property)? phandle kinda make it clear at least to me. I'd
prefer just saying "phandle to supplier". Thoughts?

Also, what's the guideline on which functions needs doc headers? I
always leaned towards adding them only for non-static functions.
That's why I skipped this one. What's the reasoning for needing one
for this? I'm happy to do this, just want to see that there's some
consistent guideline that's being followed and something I can use for
future patches.

The "or of_devlink is false" isn't true for this function?

I think that'll be too spammy during bootup. This function is expected
to fail often and it's not necessary a catastrophic failure. The
caller can print something if they care to. The current set of callers
don't.

Aren't the existing comments giving a better explanation with more context?

I'm not too sure about all the possible DT combinations to say this?
In that case, this isn't an error. As in, the consumer doesn't need to
wait for this non-existent device to get populated/added. I'd lean
towards leaving it as is and address it later if this is actually a
problem. I want of_link_to_phandle to fail only when a link can be
created, but isn't due to current system state (device isn't added,
creating a cyclic link, etc).

See my comment about not erroring on cases where a link can't ever be
created? So in your case, you'd want the caller to check the error
value to device which ones to ignore and which ones not to? That seems
a bit more fragile when this function is potentially changed in the
furture.

For example, in the earlier comment you suggested -ENODEV if there's
no device with "compatible" property that encapsulates the supplier
phandle. But -ENODEV makes more sense for this case where there's
actually no device because it hasn't been added yet. And the caller
needs to be able to distinguish between these two. Are we just going
to arbitrarily pick error values just to make sure they don't overlap?

I don't have a strong opinion one way or another, but I'm trying to
understand what's better in the long run where this function can
evolve to add more checks or handle more cases.

You call this index even in of_parse_phandle_with_args()

This going to cause a lot more line wraps for barely better names. But
I'll reluctantly do this.

This is used only in this file. I understand needing the balance
between code complexity/fragility and efficiency. But I think you push
the line too far away from efficiency. This code is literally never
going to fail because it's a static function called only inside this
file. And the check isn't that hard to understand with that tiny
comment.

Will do. Thanks for writing it.

Context:
As I said in the cover letter, avoiding unnecessary probes is just one
of the reasons for this patch. The other (arguably more important)
reason for this patch is to make sure suppliers know that they have
consumers that are yet to be probed. That way, suppliers can leave
their resource on AND in the right state if they were left on by the
bootloader. For example, if a clock was left on and at 200 MHz, the
clock provider needs to keep that clock ON and at 200 MHz till all the
consumers are probed.

Answer: Let's say a consumer device Z has suppliers A, B and C. If the
linking fails at A and you return immediately, then B and C could
probe and then figure that they have no more consumers (they don't see
a link to Z) and turn off their resources. And Z could fail
catastrophically.

This is nicer. Thanks.

Thanks. I think I was too caught up on the rest of the logic
complexity that I missed this obviously ugly code. Will fix.

Thanks,
