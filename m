Good suggestion,  it will be much more reasonable if kernel only adjust the
crashekernel value when crashkernel=auto is used. For now, I think giving a
warning could be a better solution.

Yes, and the crashkernel=auto could be more helpful with some infrastructure
for add extra kdump memory.

Let crashkernel=auto have a configurable basic size, and each component could
call kdump_memory_reserve to add to the basic size. (Like SME/SEV case here)

And currently I'm doing some experiment to reserve some pages from buddy
as the crash memory. So kernel can try reserve extra memory for kdump kernel
anytime, userspace can also tell kernel to reserve more crash memory.

If everything goes well, this may make the auto reservation even better.

crashkernel=auto just need to provide a more generic value that's enough to
contain the kernel image, initramfs, swiotlb, early boot memory, etc..
(all the continual things), plus some basic value to fits most default
kdump setups.

Extra usage could be estimated by userspace and added later.
Userspace is more aware of what service/module might be used for kdump
and can be more accurate.

This may provide a better 'auto' crashkernel solution.
