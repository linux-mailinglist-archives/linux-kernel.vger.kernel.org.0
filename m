All the pages in my test case are clean cache. But they are active,
and they need to go through the inactive list before reclaiming. The
inactive list size is designed to pre-age just enough pages for
regular reclaim targets, i.e. pages in the SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX ballpark,
In this case, the reclaim goal for a single invocation is 790M and the
inactive list is a small funnel to put all that through, and we need
several iterations to accomplish that.

But 790M is not a reasonable reclaim target to ask of a single reclaim
invocation. And it wouldn't be reasonable to optimize the reclaim code
for it. So asking for the full size but retrying is not a bad choice
here: we express our intent, and benefit if reclaim becomes better at
handling larger requests, but we also acknowledge that some of the
deltas we can encounter in memory_high_write() are just too
ridiculously big for a single reclaim invocation to manage.
