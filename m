Looking at IRQ framework which first did it the way you suggested and
then changed it to the way I did it, it looks like it allows for
drivers that need to split the initialization between early init (not
just error out, but init partly) and later driver probe. See [1].

Also, most of the other frameworks that set OF_POPULATED, set it
before calling the initialization function for the device. Maybe it's
to make sure the device node data "looks the same" whether a device is
initialized during early init or during normal device probe (since the
OF_POPULATED is set before the probe is called) -- i.e. have
OF_POPULATED  set before the device initialization code is actually
run?

Honestly I don't have a strong opinion either way, but I lean towards
following what IRQ does.
