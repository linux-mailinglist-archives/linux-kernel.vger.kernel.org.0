Examine in should_compact_retry if it's retrying because
compaction_zonelist_suitable is true. Looking at it now, it would not
necessarily do the right thing because any non-skipped zone would make
it eligible which is too strong a condition as COMPACT_SKIPPED is not
reliably set. If that function is the case, it would be reasonable
remove "ret = compaction_zonelist_suitable(ac, order, alloc_flags);" and
the implementation of compaction_zonelist_suitable entirely as part of
your fix.
