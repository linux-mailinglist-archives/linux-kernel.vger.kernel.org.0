sorry if that sounded too harsh, but the issue is not that it helped,
the issue is, that nobody talked with us about that. And those three
commits also sounded like they were mainly targeted against the Nvidia
driver (and please correct me if I am wrong here).

The situation would be completely different if we would have talked
about all this earlier (and I wouldn't get annoyed by all of this in
the first place).

I am well aware this is a super painful issue for a lot of users, but
even then disabling RTD3 (for a limited amount of hardware) inside
nouveau would be the only acceptable way to disable it.

I don't see how pushing vendors to add some firmware code to disable
certain features  helps in any way, when there is a fast and easy way
to disable it and wouldn't draw resources away from actually fixing
it.
