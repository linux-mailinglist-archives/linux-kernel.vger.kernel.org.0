If the "down migration" happens to a process that is lower in priority,
then that stays in line with the policy decisions of scheduling RT
tasks. That is, higher priority task take precedence over lower
priority tasks, even if that means "degrading" that lower priority task.

For example, if a high priority task wakes up on a CPU that is running
a lower priority task, and with the exception of that lower priority
task being pinned, it will boot it off the CPU. Even if the lower
priority task is pinned, it may still take over the CPU if it can't
find another CPU.

Note, this only happens when a big core CPU schedules. And if you do
not have HAVE_RT_PUSH_IPI (which sends IPIs to overloaded CPUS and just
schedules), then that "down migration" happens to an RT task that isn't
even running.

You can add to the logic that you do not take over an RT task that is
pinned and can't move itself. Perhaps that may be the only change to
cpu_find(), is that it will only pick a big CPU if little CPUs are
available if the big CPU doesn't have a pinned RT task on it.

Like you said, this is best effort, and I believe this is the best
approach. The policy has always been the higher the priority of a task,
the more likely it will push other tasks away. We don't change that. If
the system administrator is overloading the big cores with RT tasks,
then this is what they get.

We can change the name to something like rt.needs_pull or whatever.
