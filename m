I am concerned that added "else if" condition might not be sufficient
to eliminate all possible cases of the caller holding a scheduler lock,
which could result in deadlock in the ensuing wakeup.  Might be me missing
something, but such deadlocks have been a recurring problem in the past.

Also, your commit log's point #2 is "in_irq() implies in_interrupt()
which implies raising softirq will not do any wake ups."  This mention
of softirq seems a bit odd, given that we are going to wake up a rcuc
kthread.  Of course, this did nothing to quell my suspicions.  ;-)
