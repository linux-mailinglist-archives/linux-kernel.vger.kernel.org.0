Do you think we could optimize the common code? This sounds like
it could improve things for other architectures as well.

That should be easy enough to change in the common code, as
long as adding 'inline' does not cause harm on x86 and arm.

As far as I can tell, both the VDSO entry point and the fallback are
in architecture specific code on all architectures, so this does not
seem to be a show-stopper.

It also seems that they might be combined as long the current
powerpc code could be changed to use the generic vdso_data
structure definition: the existing code can keep being used for
gettimeofday(), clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, ...) and
clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME), while the generic implementation
can be called for clock_gettime64(), clock_getres() and clock_gettime()
with other time clock IDs.

The __kernel_timespec structure is defined with two 64-bit members so
it has the same layout on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, which
lets us share the implementation of the compat syscall handlers
even on big-endian architectures, and it avoids accidentally leaking four
bytes of stack data when copying a timespec from kernel to user
space. The high 32 bits of the nanosecond are expected to always
be zero when copying to user space, and to be ignored when copied
into the kernel (see get_timespec64()).

Note that C99 and POSIX require tv_nsec to be 'long', so 64-bit
architectures have to make it 64-bit wide, and 32-bit architectures
end up including padding for it.

In the vdso_data, the "nsec" value is shifted, so it actually needs
more bits. I don't know if this is a strict requirement, or if we could
change it to be 32 bits non-shifted during the update at the cost
of losing 1 nanosecond of accuracy.
