I guess I'm not *against* a DT loader shim populating the panel-id
over into /chosen.. I had it in mind as a backup plan.  Ofc still need
to get dt folks to buy into /chosen/panel-id but for DT boot I think
that is the best option.  (At least the /chosen/panel-id approach
doesn't require the shim to be aware of how the panel is wired up to
dsi controller and whether their is a bridge in between, and that
short of thing, so the panel-id approach seems more maintainable that
other options.)

I am a bit fearful of problems arising from different distros and
users using different versions of shim, and how to manage that.  I
guess if somehow "shim thing" was part of the kernel, there would by
one less moving part... I'd know if user had kernel vX.Y.Z they'd be
good to go vs not.  But *also* depending on a new-enough version of a
shim, where the version # is probably not easily apparent to the end
user, sounds a bit scary from the "all the things that can go wrong"
point of view.  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I'm a bit worried about how to
manage that.
