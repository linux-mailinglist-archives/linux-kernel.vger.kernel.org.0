Understood, but I was assuming you need to know how it was configured
for some reason?

It's not the kernel's job to validate the DT is correct. Someone could
just as easily define a panel that doesn't match with the configured
format as they could having lvds-?bits set incorrectly.

So get the wire format from the panel driver (either implied or by DT
property) and assume that matches the configuration of the controller.
Though, I guess if the model is each end of the wire should advertise
what it supports and the core picks the best format, then that only
works if you advertise both formats. Or we could allow jeida-{24,18}
property at both ends of the graph.
