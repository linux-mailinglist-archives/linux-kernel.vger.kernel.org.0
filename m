In the context of Xen Arm, the dev_addr is a host physical address. From 
my understanding pfn_valid() is dealing with a guest physical frame.

Therefore by passing PFN_DOWN(dev_addr) in argument you assume that the 
host and guest address spaces are the same.

Moving xen_dma_* routines into the arch would be a good option. 
Although, I would still consider a stub version for arch not requiring 
specific DMA.
