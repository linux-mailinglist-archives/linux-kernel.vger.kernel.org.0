Note the "often a maintainer of the relevant code" bit.  And
"appropriate for inclusion into the kernel" means to me that you've
done the same level of review as Reviewed-by.  So I have very
different understanding of how Acked-by and Reviewed-by than you do.

That being said, no offence to you, but any kind of Acked-by or
Reviewed-by from you is not going to have as much weight as say, a
Reviewed-by: from someone like Jan Kara.  That's just because I don't
have a good sense to your technical ability, and so I'd be doing a
full review myself and not rely on your review at all....

Cheers,

P.S.  And if I find a problem in the patch, and someone had attached
their Acked-by or Reviewed-by to it, it would have the same negative
hit to their reputation either way.  Not a big deal if it happens only
once, or it's an esepcially tricky issue, but it if happens more than
once or is really blatent, I as the maintainer definitely do remember.
