It doesn't cause buffer overflow.  The problem was that a transfer got
terminated too early because the transfer length for one of the URBs
was not divisible by the maxpacket size.

You might be better off not using kmalloc.  It's easier for the kernel 
to allocate a bunch of small buffers than a single big one.  Then you 
can create a separate URB for each buffer.

These last two paragraphs don't need to be in the patch description.

I'm not sufficiently familiar with the usbip drivers to review most of 
this.  However...

You probably shouldn't do this, for two reasons.  First, sg_tablesize
of the server's HCD may be smaller than ~0.  If the client's value is
larger than the server's, a transfer could be accepted on the client
but then fail on the server because the SG list was too big.

Also, you may want to restrict the size of SG transfers even further,
so that you don't have to allocate a tremendous amount of memory all at
once on the server.  An SG transfer can be quite large.  I don't know 
what a reasonable limit would be -- 16 perhaps?
