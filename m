It's badly documented, I agree, but have a look at https://git.kernel.org/p=
ub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/xen-netback/xen=
bus.c#n480. Connected -> Closed is not a valid transition, and I don't thin=
k it was ever intended to be.

They can, but it is even more poorly documented what should be done in this=
 case.

Ok, I'll add such a flag and define it for blkback only, in patch #4 i.e. w=
hen it actually gains the ability to rebind.

For some reason, when I originally tested, the xenstore area disappeared. I=
 checked again and it did not this time. I just ended up with a frontend st=
uck in state 5 (because it is the system disk and won't go offline) trying =
to talk to a non-existent backend. Upon re-bind the backend goes into state=
 5 (because it sees the 5 in the frontend) and leaves the guest wedged.
