Having tried and failed to remove DEC Alpha support several times, I
know which way to bet.  Though DEC Alpha support is no longer much of a
burden on the non-Alpha portions of Linux, so no longer much motivation
for removing its support.

The overhead is incurred in a rare case, and on systems lacking oneshot
timer it is always possible to fall back on normal timers, albeit with
fixed-time added delays.  But yes, this does add a bit of complexity.

Alternatively, assuming this case is rare, normal timers might suffice
without the need for hrtimers.

I have no idea either way.

It is sometimes the case that showing that something never happens makes
people more comfortable with enforcing that something.
