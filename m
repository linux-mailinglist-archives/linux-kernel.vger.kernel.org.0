I mean, the uncorrectable ECC error is caused by hardware which may lead 
to corrupted nodes detected in UBIFS. I found uncorretable ECC errors on 
my NAND, in the environment of high temperature and humidity.

At present, UBIFS ignores all EBADMSG errors, so the corrupted node is 
only considered in being caused by unfinished writing. I think UBIFS 
should consider the corrupted area caused by ECC errors in process 
ubifs_recover_leb(). no_more_nodes() will skip a read-write unit. Maybe 
the corrupted area is skipped.
