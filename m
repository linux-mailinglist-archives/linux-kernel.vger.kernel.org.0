No idea this is good or bad, where's the userspace for it?

Hm, so essentially we'd need to move _all_ drm allocators into dma-buf
heaps, for all drivers? Can't just do this for TI only ...

Yeah that's what I'd expected to happen. Speciality heaps for when you
have the relevant something unusual (and I'm not sure whether upstream
does want something unusual really, the above examples from you sound
a bit strange).
