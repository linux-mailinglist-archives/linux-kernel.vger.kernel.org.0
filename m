We're not trying to do anything life-threatening.
So the latency requirements are only moderate - failures mess up telephone
audio quality. There is also allowance for jitter elsewhere.
OTOH not running a high priority process when there are idle cpu seems 'sub-optimal'.

Code that runs with a spin-lock held (or otherwise disables preemption)
for significant periods probably ought to be detected and warned.
I'm not sure of a suitable limit, 100us is probably excessive on x86.

IIUC PREEMPT_RT adds overhead to quite a bit of code and is unlikely
to get enabled in 'distro' kernels.
Especially since they've not enabled CONFIG_PREEMPT which probably
has a lower impact - provided the cv+mutex wakeup has been arranged
to avoid the treble process switch.

Running the driver bh (which is often significant) from a high priority
worker thread instead of a softint (which isn't much different to the
'hardint' it is scheduled from) probably doesn't cost much (in-kernel
process switches shouldn't be much more than a stack switch).
That would benefit RT processes since they could be higher
priority than the bh code.
Although you'd probably want a 'strongly preferred' cpu for them.
