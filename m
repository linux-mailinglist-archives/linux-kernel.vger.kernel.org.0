This flag is suggested by Martin Petersen, while the first version of the patchset was based
on a separate operation.

Since I see only Jens in MAINTAINERS:

BLOCK LAYER
M:      Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>
L:      linux-block@vger.kernel.org
T:      git git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-block.git
S:      Maintained
F:      block/
F:      drivers/block/
F:      kernel/trace/blktrace.c
F:      lib/sbitmap.c

I expect his comments about final design of this, because both you and Martin are maintainers
of another subsystems. I don't want rework this many times until Jens says he wants some third
design.

I think I'm pretty polite and patient in my waiting, while Jens completely ignores me by some
reasons, which are completely unclear for me. I don't think this is completely polite in relation
to me.

Kirill
