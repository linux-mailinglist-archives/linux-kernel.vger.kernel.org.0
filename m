KASAN keeps information about object with the object, right after payload in the kasan_alloc_meta struct.
This information is always valid as long as slab page allocated. Currently it keeps only one last free stacktrace.
It could be extended to record more free stacktraces and also record previously used tags which will allow you
to identify use-after-free and extract right free stacktrace.
