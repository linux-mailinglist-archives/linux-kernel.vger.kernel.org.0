Oops, didn't notice the ! on the second test.

Are you sure !DDP implies num_bufs == 1?

All this look suspicious, and even if the fall through logic
has no side effects in practice (which I'm still not sure is the case),
I think it'd be better to explicitly set the flags that have
to be set in each case statement and add breaks.
