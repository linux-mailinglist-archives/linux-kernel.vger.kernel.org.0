So invalidate callbacks need to reset the map, and they do
not have vq mutex. How can they do this and free
the map safely? They need synchronize_rcu or kfree_rcu right?

And I worry somewhat that synchronize_rcu in an MMU notifier
is a problem, MMU notifiers are supposed to be quick:
they are on a read side critical section of SRCU.

If we could get rid of RCU that would be even better.

But now I wonder:
	invalidate_start has to mark page as dirty
	(this is what my patch added, current code misses this).

	at that point kernel can come and make the page clean again.

	At that point VQ handlers can keep a copy of the map
	and change the page again.


At this point I don't understand how we can mark page dirty
safely.

Yes, expedited is not good for something guest can trigger.
Let's just use kfree_rcu if we can. Paul said even though
documentation still says it needs to be rate-limited, that
part is basically stale and will get updated.
