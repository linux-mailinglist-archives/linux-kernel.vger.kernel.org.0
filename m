I understood the wording in stable-kernel-rules.rst as meaning that
comments on Cc: lines make mentioned commit pulled in (cherry-picked).
In this case I think this is ok, but in case the pulled-in patch changes
something else (the dependency is only because of touching nearby code),
how would I specify this and avoid the hint to include the other patch?
