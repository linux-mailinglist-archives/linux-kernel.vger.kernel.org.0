I hear what you say.  And I agree, parent/mfd drivers should not request
resources on behalf of it's children.

But on the other side, something is broken by design in mfd, if it is
not possible for parent/mfd driver to request the resources for itself,
which naturally contains the resources for all it's mfd
functions/childs.

Please take a look at mfd_add_device() in drivers/mfd/mfd-core.c, and
the use of the cell and mem_base arguments in particular.

        for (r = 0; r < cell->num_resources; r++) {
                res[r].name = cell->resources[r].name;
                res[r].flags = cell->resources[r].flags;

                /* Find out base to use */
                if ((cell->resources[r].flags & IORESOURCE_MEM) && mem_base) {
                        res[r].parent = mem_base;
                        res[r].start = mem_base->start +
                                cell->resources[r].start;
                        res[r].end = mem_base->start +
                                cell->resources[r].end;

It really is a core part of mfd drivers that you request a memory
resource for the mfd driver, and then have one or more child memory
resources requsted with the parent memory resource as base.

Many mfd drivers handle resources like this, like: htc/pasic3.c,
sta2x11-mfd.c and intel-lpss.c.
Ofcourse, the sm501.c driver does not, as it does not use the mfd API at
all, and is thus not a good example of a mfd driver, and there is
therefore no good examples of using 8250 with an mfd driver.
