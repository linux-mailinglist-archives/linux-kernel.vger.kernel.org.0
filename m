Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: x86: Explain Intel model naming convention

This was written in an e-mail by Dave Hansen, but not everybody
reads the entire LKML archive before posting a patch.

+=======================
+Intel CPU model numbers
+=======================
+
+The CPU model number on a running system can be found by executing
+the CPUID(EAX=0) instruction to find the vendor, family, model
+and stepping.  The model number is found by concatenating two bit
+fields from the EAX return value. Bits 19:16 (extended model number)
+and 7:4 (model number).
+
+Inside the Linux kernel the vendor, family, model and stepping are
+stored in the cpuinfo_x86 structure. Model specific code typically
+uses x86_match_cpu() to determine if it is running on any of some
+list of CPU models.
+
+There are several subsystems that need model specific handling on
+Intel CPUs. For code legibility it is better to assign names for
+the various model numbers in the include file <asm/intel-family.h>
+
+Currently all interesting Intel CPU models are in family 6.
+
+HOWTO Build an INTEL_FAM6_ definition:
+
+1. Start with INTEL_FAM6_
+2. If not Core-family, add a note about it, like "ATOM".  There are only
+   two options for this (Xeon Phi and Atom).  It is exceedingly unlikely
+   that you are adding a cpu which needs a new option here.
+3. Add the processor microarchitecture, not the platform name
+4. Add a short differentiator if necessary.  Add an _X to differentiate
+   Server from Client.
+5. Add an optional comment with the platform name(s)
+
+It should end up looking like this:
+
+INTEL_FAM6_<ATOM?>_<MICROARCH>_<SHORT...> /* Platform Name */
