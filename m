Hi Chris. Is this exactly what I'm hitting at
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111500 perhaps?

It reliably breaks the graphics userland, as the machine consistently
freezes at any random moment.

Any workaround options, even if with a performance penalty? Revert
cb6d7c7dc7ff but side effects?

5.3 has useful NVMe power mgmt updates for laptops, I'd like to stick
with the newest if possible.
