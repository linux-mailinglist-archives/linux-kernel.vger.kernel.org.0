I think this would be useful in general. The information is not that
useful outside of debugging. Even then it's only useful when trying to
get a handle on why a path like compaction is taking too long.

I would prefer this option not be taken. It would increase the cost of
watermark calculations which is a relatively fast path.

I think it will. The patch as it is contains the overhead within the
reader of the pagetypeinfo proc file which is a non-critical path. The
page allocator paths on the other hand is very important.
