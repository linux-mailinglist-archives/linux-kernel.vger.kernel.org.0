Here's part of the commit description:

    USB: fix usbmon BUG trigger
    
    Automated tests triggered this by opening usbmon and accessing the
    mmap while simultaneously resizing the buffers. This bug was with
    us since 2006, because typically applications only size the buffers
    once and thus avoid racing. Reported by Kirill A. Shutemov.

As it happens, I spent a little time investigating this bug report just
yesterday.  It seems to me that the easiest fix would be to disallow
resizing the buffer while it is mapped by any users.  (Besides,
allowing that seems like a bad idea in any case.)

Pete, does that seem reasonable to you?
