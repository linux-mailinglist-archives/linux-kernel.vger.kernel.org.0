Right. So maybe we make tables of rates and put it in the driver and
keep adding code in there? I'm worried about having these properties in
DT and then having to work around them later on by "fixing" the DT. If
it's only in the driver then we're able to tweak the values to get
better jitter numbers, etc.

Hmm.. Perhaps we need a clk_set_mode() API? Possibly be an internal API
that lets the DT configure the mode to be differential or single ended?
Nobody has required this so far so it's very rare, but I'd like to see
the properties become standard instead of vendor specific if possible.

Why can't that driver call clk_prepare_enable()? Is there some sort of
assumption that this clk will always be enabled and not have a driver
that configures the rate and gates/ungates it?
