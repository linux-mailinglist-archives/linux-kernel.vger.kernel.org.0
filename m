I re-read the cover letter [1] because it usually is the place
to "pitch" a feature.

It fails to address two things:

1. How and in what circumstances is an untrusted stack is a better
   vessel for handling exceptions than the register based approach
   that we already have?
2. How is it simpler approach? There is a strong claim of simplicity
   and convenience without anything backing it.
3. Why we need both register and stack based approach co-exist? I'd go
   with one approach for a new API without any legacy whatsoever.

This really needs a better pitch before we can consider doing anything
to it.

Also, in [2] there is talk about the next revision. Maybe the way go
forward is to address the three issues I found in the cover letter
and fix whatever needed to be fixed in the actual patches?
