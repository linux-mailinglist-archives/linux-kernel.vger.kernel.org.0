No, that was NOT what my argument was.

My argument is that you have to have self-describing data somehow,
otherwise you will always get out of sync with what the kernel is
exporting and what userspace expects.  The above crazy procfs example
proves my point very well :)

sysfs "solves" this problem by requiring one value per file.  If the
file is not present, userspace "knows" that the value isn't there at
all.  It a simple solution for the problem that procfs has with multiple
values in single files and is why we did it that way.

Now that's not to say this is the only way to solve the issue here, it's
just the one that we decided to use at the time.  statfs can choose to
do it differently, but it can NOT just ignore the problem here,
otherwise we end up with the old procfs problems as you show above.

Yes, opening thousands of files is "slow", that's known :)

Exporting hundreds of thousands of files, what could go wrong? :)

Those are nice things to think about while doing this, but I think we
are a long ways off from these types of issues.
