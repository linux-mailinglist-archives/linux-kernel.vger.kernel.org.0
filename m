The last time I measured it was in U-Boot (and for the FIT image, not
an actual DT), but the parsing time for a FIT image with a kernel and
DTB was around 100ms.

(and adding the PSCI and simplefb nodes was in the same order of
magnitude).

Boot time was very sensitive, and I had to remove both.

I don't really know, I'm not sure the proliferation of tags would be a
good thing either, and I'm not the dtc maintainer, so I don't really
have a say in this :)

I guess that would be good too, but the semantics are a bit different
so we'd need a different tag.
