Hi Frank,

Thank you for your comment!

Indeed. As an example of tracing settings in the first mail, even for simple
use-case,  the trace command is long and complicated. I think it is hard to
express that as 1-liner kernel command line. But devicetree looks very good
for expressing structured data. That is great and I like it :)

Yes, at this moment. Can't we talk about some future things?

Thanks, I'll check that.

Ah, "chosen" will be suit for me :)

Hmm, then, can we add "ftrace" node under "chosen" node?
It seems that "chosen" is supporting some (flat) properties, and I would
like to add a tree of nodes for describing per-event setting.

What about something like below? (do we need "compatible" ?)

chosen {
	linux,ftrace {
		tp-printk;
		buffer-size-kb = <400>;
		event0 {
			event = "...";
		};
	};
};

No, that is not what I intended. My intention was to trace boot up
process "without recompiling kernel", but with a structured data.

For such purpose, we have to implement a tool to parse and pack the
data and a channel to load it at earlier stage in bootloader. And
those are already done by devicetree. Thus I thought I could get a
piggyback on devicetree.

Thank you,
