Let me clarify that the upcoming rework is _not_ simply to make a
kthread-based printk. There upcoming rework addresses several issues
(kthreads being only a piece):

1. allow printk-callers to get their messages immediately and locklessly
   into the log buffer from any context

2. during normal operation, printk-callers are completely decoupled from
   console printing

3. in the case of an emergency, every printk-caller will directly and
   synchronously perform console printing of its messages on consoles
   that support atomic writing

For the rework we decided that triggering an oops is what irreversibly
transitions the system from "normal operation" to "emergency".

One could interpret the current "console_verbose()" to be some sort of
equivalent to irreversibly transitioning the system to "emergency". But
that is not how it was decided to be interpreted. For the rework,
printk-callers do not have any influence on forcing immediate console
printing (unless they trigger an oops). console_verbose() is still
relevant in the rework. console_verbose() is affecting _what_ is printed
to consoles and _not when_.

Once the printk rework is complete, the mechanisms for atomic and
synchronous console printing will be in place. It would be possible that
these mechanisms could also be used in non-oops scenarios. But that
would need to be discussed in depth and clearly defined with caution for
abuse.
