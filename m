There is a UART routing control driver for ASPEED that spawned my push
to soc/aspeed.  The advice on that thread was to put such drivers
there.  There's likely to be a few more control-focused aspeed
drivers.

For Nuvoton, we definitely expect some similar LPC control drivers.
Possibly an LPC snoop driver, similar to aspeed-lpc-snoop.  This
supports the idea of creating some form of bmc subsystem as suggested
above (or in a different thread).
