I am hitting this panic when I boot my juno board.


I have CONFIG_CPU_ISOLATION=y but I don't pass nohuz_full nor isolcpus in the
commandline. I think what's going on is that housekeeping_setup() doesn't get
called and hence housekeeping_mask isn't initialized in my case, causing this
check to fail and trigger the panic.

The below seems to 'fix' it though not sure if it's the right way forward.
A revert obviously fixes it too but I doubt we want that :-)
