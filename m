Doing these, sure, but doing these while ranges are really checked ?
I mean, the MMU grants you access to the pages you were assigned. Here
with the I/O bitmap you just have to ask for access to port X and you
get it. I could understand the benefit if we had EBUSY in return but
that's not the case, you can actually request access to a port range
another device driver or process is currently using, and mess up with
what it does even by accident. I remember streaming 1-bit music in
userland from the LED of my floppy drive in the late-90s, it used to
cause some trouble to the floppy driver when using mtools in parallel :-)
