Agreed that drm_cflush_* isn't a great API.  In this particular case
(IIUC), I need wb+inv so that there aren't dirty cache lines that drop
out to memory later, and so that I don't get a cache hit on
uncached/wc mmap'ing.

Tying it in w/ iommu seems a bit weird to me.. but maybe that is just
me, I'm certainly willing to consider proposals or to try things and
see how they work out.

Exposing the arch_sync_* API and using that directly (bypassing
drm_cflush_*) actually seems pretty reasonable and pragmatic.  I did
have one doubt, as phys_to_virt() is only valid for kernel direct
mapped memory (AFAIU), what happens for pages that are not in kernel
linear map?  Maybe it is ok to ignore those pages, since they won't
have an aliased mapping?
