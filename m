Correct, that's what I meant :)

We should basically fallback to whatever was supposed to be returned if this
patch is not applied.

	if (lower_mask) {
		// record the value of the first valid lower_mask

		if lower_mask doesn't contain a fitting CPU:
			continue searching in the next priority level
	}

	if no fitting cpu was found at any lower level:
		return the recorded first valid lower_mask

I'm not sure how to translate 'trumps' here.

So priority has precedence over capacity. I think this is not the best option,
but it keeps the rules consistent; which is if a higher priority task is
runnable it'd be pushed to another CPU running a lower priority one if we can
find one. We'll attempt to make sure this CPU fits the capacity requirement of
the task, but if there isn't one we'll fallback to the next best thing.

I think this makes sense and will keep this fitness logic generic.

Maybe it's easier to discuss over a patch. I will post one soon hopefully.

Thanks
