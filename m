well, I don't mind too much if the patch is rejected, it doesn't
really cause a problem (at least upstream) to have both ACPI and DT
config tables.  But I figured I'd at least point out why DtbLoader
wasn't removing the ACPI tables (when grub is not involved) in the
form of a patch..

I don't think this is necessarily true.  With ACPI boot you can still
get far enough to run an installer and get to the point where you can
install OS updates.  The experience isn't great without PEP.. but more
or less the same is true on x86 laptops, where you need to get to the
point of installing updated kernel and/or mesa to have accelerated
graphics and other nice things.  The "PEP" driver is just another
thing that needs to get installed via HLOS updates.

That said, coming up with some sort of PEP mechanism for linux is
beyond what I have weekend hacking bandwidth for, so I'll leave that
for someone else.  Right now I'd be happy to get the various patchsets
we need to have things working landed upstream, and have some sort of
sane/standardized way to manage DT boot.  (Either DtbLoader or
something in grub picking the correct dtb file based on what we can
pull out of SMBIOS tables seems the sanest thing to me.)

Eventually if we have enough different aarch64 "ACI" laptops and users
out there, I think the DT approach will become too painful and we'll
have to tackle PEP for linux.. at least thats a problem I hope we have
eventually.
