Hi,

This appears to be a bizarrely formatted reply to Anshuman's questions
[1] on the first posting [2] of this patch, and as it stands, it isn't
possible to follow.

Please follow the usual mailing list ettiquette, and reply inline to
questions.

I am not going to reply further to this post, but I'll comment on the
first post.

Thanks,
Mark.
