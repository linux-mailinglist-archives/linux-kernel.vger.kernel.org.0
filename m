The differences in behaviour would be marginal given that the original
fixed value for the v3 patch would generally be smaller than an LLC. For
the moment, I'm assuming that v4 will be based on the number of CPUs in
the node.

I'm dropping the check of the child domain entirely. The lookups to get
the LLC size are relatively expensive without any data indicating it's
worthwhile.
