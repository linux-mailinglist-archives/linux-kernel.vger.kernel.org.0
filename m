What we definately see people have difficulties with is economy. And also g=
ood plugins and mastering on the sound side.

This should probably be a standard part of the IS (os) aswell.

Personally I think a 4-band mastering RMS based process sounds the best, kn=
ee here also interesting, with only tops taken by the final limiter. (which=
 is best with reduced processing in release, with threshold or similar)

And then earlier we also support 4K quadratic grid RGBW subpixles at 72,734=
hz which is minimal psychovisual noise.

Maing the A/V part of this optimal, and a lot of this is part of the POP cu=
lture that will be on this.

Still also taking considerations to researchers who may publish their stuff=
 in the same way and gain correct exposure through a correctly indexed file=
structure, which goes for both.

Being the end of .com confusion, and rather a whole filestructure for it, w=
ithout unnecessary logins or other, people finding their files and correct =
commerciality enojoined.

Peace.
