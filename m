Fair enough.  The root cause was actually a bug in binutils which gets
triggered by a new clang feature.  So instead of reverting the above
patch, I think I've figured out a way to work around the binutils bug,
while also improving objtool at the same time (win-win).

The binutils bug will be fixed in binutils 2.35.

BTW, to be fair, this was less "Clang has issues" and more "Josh is
lazy".  I didn't test the patch with Clang -- I tend to rely on 0-day
bot reports because I don't have the bandwidth to test the
kernel/config/toolchain combinations.  Nick tells me Clang will soon be
integrated with the 0-day bot, which should help prevent this type of
thing in the future.
