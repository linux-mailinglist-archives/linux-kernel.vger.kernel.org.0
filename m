FWIW, I'm aware of the interaction with NORESERVE and my thoughts are:

AFAICT, the 2 counter approach we have here is strictly superior to
the 1 upgraded counter approach. Consider these points:

- From what I can tell so far, everything you can do with the 1
counter approach, you can do with the two counter approach by setting
both limit_in_bytes and reservation_limit_in_bytes to the limit value.
That will limit both reservations and at fault allocations.

- The 2 counter approach preserves existing usage of hugetlb cgroups,
so no need to muck around with reverting the feature some time from
now because of broken users. No existing users of hugetlb cgroups need
to worry about the effect of this on their usage.

- Users that use hugetlb memory strictly through reservations can use
only reservation_limit_in_bytes and enjoy cgroup limits that never
SIGBUS the application. This is our usage for example.

- The 2 counter approach provides more info to the sysadmin. The
sysadmin knows exactly how much reserved bytes there are via
reservation_usage_in_bytes, and how much actually in use bytes there
are via usage_in_bytes. They can even detect NORESERVE usage if
usage_in_bytes > reservation_usage_in_bytes. failcnt shows failed
reservations *and* failed allocations at fault, etc. All around better
debuggability when things go wrong. I think this is particularly
troubling for the 1 upgraded counter approach. That counter's
usage_in_bytes doesn't tell you if the usage came from reservations or
allocations at fault time.

- Honestly, I think the 2 counter approach is easier to document and
understand by the userspace? 1 counter that vaguely tracks both the
reservations and usage and decides whether or not to charge at fault
time seems hard to understand what really happened after something
goes wrong. 1 counter that tracks reservations and 1 counter that
tracks actual usage seem much simpler to digest, and provide better
visibility to what the cgroup is doing as I mentioned above.

I think it may be better if I keep the 2 counter approach but
thoroughly document the interaction between the existing counters and
NORESERVE. What do you think?

FWIW, it may be prudent to consider deprecating MAP_NORESERVE, if
that's an option. I'm not sure what that benefit that provides
applications, and on the other hand it makes it hard for the kernel to
guarantee the hugetlb memory is available to the application that
requested it, and makes it harder for the cgroups to police hugetlb
usage without SIGBUSing something. But that may be a discussion for
another proposal.
