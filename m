Well, for shmem you can't really call allocators directly, right?

One thing I have in my pipeline is a dma_alloc_pages API that allocates
pages that are guaranteed to be addressably by the device or otherwise
fail.  But that doesn't really help with the shmem fs.

Which is fine as long as the GPU itself supports full 64-bit addressing
(or always sits behind an iommu), and the platform doesn't impose
addressing limit, which unfortunately some that are shipped right now
still do :(

But userspace malloc really means dma_map_* anyway, so not really
relevant for memory allocations.
