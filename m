Subject: [PATCH v1 1/5] arm: dts: imx6: toradex: use SPDX-License-Identifier
Date:   Mon, 24 Feb 2020 19:32:24 +0200
Message-Id: <1582565548-20627-1-git-send-email-igor.opaniuk@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Igor Opaniuk <igor.opaniuk@toradex.com>

1. Replace boiler plate licenses texts with the SPDX license
identifiers in Toradex iMX6-based SoM device trees.
2. As X11 is identical to the MIT License, but with an extra sentence
that prohibits using the copyright holders' names for advertising or
promotional purposes without written permission, use MIT license instead
of X11 ('s/X11/MIT/g').
