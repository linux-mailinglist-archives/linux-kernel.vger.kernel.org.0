Hello everyone,

Friendly reminder that the TAB elections are coming soon:

The Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board (TAB) serves as the
interface between the kernel development community and the Linux
Foundation. The TAB advises the Foundation on kernel-related matters,
helps member companies learn to work with the community, and works to
resolve community-related problems before they get out of hand.  We
also support the Code of Conduct committee in their mission.

The board has ten members, one of whom sits on the Linux Foundation
board of directors.

The election to select five TAB members will be held at the 2019 Kernel =
Summit
in Lisbon, Portugal September 9-11. As has been announced[2], we are =
moving to
an electronic voting system this year. Further details about the exact =
voting
procedures will be coming soon. Anyone is eligible to stand for =
election,
simply send your nomination to:

tech-board-discuss at lists.linux-foundation.org

With your nomination, please include a short candidate statement. This =
candidate
statement should focus on why you are running and what you hope to =
accomplish
on the TAB. We will be collecting these statements and making them =
publicly=20
available.

The deadline for receiving nominations is 9am GMT+1 on September 9th =
(the first
day of Kernel Summit). Due to the use of electronic voting, this will be =
a hard
deadline!

Current TAB members, and their election year:

Jon Corbet		2017
Greg Kroah-Hartman	2017
Steven Rostedt		2017
Ted Tso			2017
Tim Bird		2017

Chris Mason		2018
Laura Abbott		2018
Olof Johansson		2018
Kees Cook		2018
Dan Williams		2018

The five slots from 2017 are all up for election.  As always, please
let us know if you have questions, and please do consider running.

Thanks,
Laura

[1] TAB members sit for a term of two years, and half of the board is
up for election every year. Five of the seats are up for election now.
The other five are halfway through their term and will be up for
election next year.
