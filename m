This swap-rand-w-mt workload is anon only.

I think LKP robot has captured these two metrics but the report didn't
show them, which means the number is about the same with or without
patch #1.

But with small inactive list, the pages that would be on inactive list
will stay on active list? I think the larger inactive list is mainly
used to give the anon page a chance to be promoted to active list now
that anon pages land on inactive list first, but on reclaim, I don't see
how a larger inactive list can cause fewer swap outs.

Forgive me for my curiosity and feel free to ignore my question as I
don't want to waste your time on this. Your patchset looks a worthwhile
thing to do, it's just the robot's report on patch1 seems er...
