I'm with you on that sentiment, but in the environment I'm currently =

looking at, we have neither DT nor ACPI: The kernel gets purely =

configured via kernel command line. For other unenumerable artifacts on =

the system, such as virtio-mmio platform devices, that works well enough =

and also basically "hacks a kernel parameter" to specify the system layout.

Care to elaborate a bit here? I was under the impression that =

"swiotlb=3Dforce" basically allows you to steer the DMA bounce buffering =

decisions already.


Thanks!
