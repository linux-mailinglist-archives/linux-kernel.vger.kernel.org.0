I think it's subtle, but the use of the word "allocate" instead of using 
"reserve" might be confusing here.  Might want to reword it.

I'm not sure the developers are interested in being restricted by 
hugetlb_cgroups :)  I think users get constrained by hugetlb_cgroup so the 
developers are interested in the failure more: do we want to SIGBUS at 
fault and not be allowed an opportunity to influence that (today) or do we 
want to fallback to non-hugetlbfs memory and just keep going (tomorrow, 
after your patchset).

Is there a max_usage_in_bytes equivalent?  It's a page_counter so I assume 
it's easy to support.

I'll defer the naming to Mike here, "rsvd" seems to be the hugetlb way of 
saying "reserved".
