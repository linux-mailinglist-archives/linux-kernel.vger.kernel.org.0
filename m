I was specifically thinking of this:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/pagewalk.c#L103

If a huge pud is concurrently faulted in here, it will immediatly get 
split without getting processed in pud_entry(). An external lock would 
protect against that, but that's perhaps a bug in the pagewalk code?  
For pmds the situation is not the same since when pte_entry is used, all 
pmds will unconditionally get split.

There's a similar more scary race in

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/mm/memory.c#L3931

It looks like if a concurrent thread faults in a huge pud just after the 
test for pud_none in that pmd_alloc, things might go pretty bad.
