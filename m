Hearing no objections, and having more confidence in other commits that
(allegedly) guarantee forward progress for nohz_full CPUs, i have pulled
this into -rcu for testing and further review.  Please see below for the
updated patch.

commit 23a58acde0eea57ac77377e5d50d9562b2dbdfaa
Author: Lai Jiangshan <laijs@linux.alibaba.com>
Date:   Sat Feb 15 14:37:26 2020 -0800

    rcu: Don't set nesting depth negative in rcu_preempt_deferred_qs()
    
    Now that RCU flavors have been consolidated, an RCU-preempt
    rcu_rea_unlock() in an interrupt or softirq handler cannot possibly
    end the RCU read-side critical section.  Consider the old vulnerability
    involving rcu_preempt_deferred_qs() being invoked within such a handler
    that interrupted an extended RCU read-side critical section, in which
    a wakeup might be invoked with a scheduler lock held.  Because
    rcu_read_unlock_special() no longer does wakeups in such situations,
    it is no longer necessary for rcu_preempt_deferred_qs() to set the
    nesting level negative.
    
    This commit therfore removes this recursion-protection code from
    rcu_preempt_deferred_qs().
