I agree that it shouldn't be required, but it should be possible. We
shouldn't add new entry points that don't integrate with the standard
way of booting the kernel.

We call ExitBootServices() in the EFI stub, so this is fine as long as
the EFI stub hands over control to the SL code. But yes, I think it's
a requirement that it be kernel-owned code calling ExitBootServices().

Ok. The firmware TPM interfaces are gone after ExitBootServices(), so
we're going to need an additional implementation.

How does Windows manage this? Retaining access to EFI runtime services
is necessary, and the areas in the memory map marked as runtime
services code or data should be considered part of the TCB and
measured - they're very much not part of the gap.
