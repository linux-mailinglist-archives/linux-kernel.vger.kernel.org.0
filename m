In our issue, we got fp=pc=0xFFFFFF8025A13BA0, so cannot exit while
loop in dump_basktrace().
After analyze our issue's dump, we found one task(such as: task A)
is exiting via invoke do_exit() during another task is showing task
A's dumptask. In kernel code, do_exit() and exit_notify are defined
as follows:
void noreturn do_exit(long code)
{
      ......
      exit_notify(tsk, group_dead);
      ......
}
static void exit_notify(struct task_struct *tsk, int group_dead)
{
      ......
}
Because of exit_notify() is a static function, so it is inlined to
do_exit() when compile kernel, so we can get partial assembly code
of do_exit() as follows:
……
{
         bool autoreap;
         struct task_struct *p, *n;
         LIST_HEAD(dead);

         write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
      c10:       90000000        adrp    x0, 0 <tasklist_lock>
      c14:       910003e8        mov     x8, sp
      c18:       91000000        add     x0, x0, #0x0
*/
static void exit_notify(struct task_struct *tsk, int group_dead)
{
         bool autoreap;
         struct task_struct *p, *n;
         LIST_HEAD(dead);
      c1c:       a90023e8        stp     x8, x8, [sp]

         write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
      c20:       94000000        bl      0 <_raw_write_lock_irq>
      c24:       f9435268        ldr     x8, [x19,#1696]
……
 From the code "c14:" and "c1c:", we will find sp's addr value is stored
in sp and sp+8, so sp's vaule equal (sp+8)'s value.
In our issue, there is a chance of fp point sp, so there will be 
fp=pc=fp's
addr value,so code cannot break from while loop in dump_backtrace().

I haven't found any lock preventing a task in this situation, and I 
think we shouldn't
prevent task running if this task is scheduled.

'saved_state|sp|fp' only applies to non-current tasks.

In this patch, it will break while loop and stop to print backtrace if 
we
find the task's state change or there is a chance of an infinite loop.

1. we can use "cur_state != tsk->state" prevent printing backtrace if 
the task's
    state is changed after "saved" task's state.
2. we can use "cur_sp != thread_saved_sp(tsk)" and "cur_fp != 
thread_saved_fp(tsk)"
    prevent printing backtrace if the task's state is changed before 
"saved" task's
    state. Because the value of "thread_saved_sp(tsk)" and 
"thread_saved_fp(tsk)"
    will not equal "saved" sp(cur_sp) and fp(cur_fp).
