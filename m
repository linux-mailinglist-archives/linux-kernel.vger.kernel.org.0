Much better!  A few comments below.

You initialize here, which makes quite a bit of sense...

But then you reinitialize here.  Perhaps to avoid the compiler being
confused into complaining about uninitialized variables?  (But if so,
please comment it.)

The thing is that by the fourth measurement, the initial influence has
been diluted by a factor of something like 16 or 32, correct?  I don't
believe that your measurements are any more accurate than that, given the
bursty nature of the RCU reclamation process.  So why not just initialize
it and average it at each sample point?

If you want more accuracy, you could increase the number of sample
points, while changing the filter constants to more heavily weight
past measurements.

Actually, I strongly suggest recording frequent raw data, and applying
various filtering techniques offline to see what works best.  I might
be mistaken, but it feels like you are shooting in the dark here.

This added comment is much better, thank you!
