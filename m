They are two entirely different things.  The explicit protection bits are
consumed by the kernel, while SECINFO.flags is consumed by the CPU.  The
intent is to have the protection flags be analogous to mprotect(), the
fact that they have a similar/identical format to SECINFO is irrelevant.

Calling the field secinfo_flags_mask is straight up wrong on SGX2, as 
userspace can use EMODPE to set SECINFO after the page is added.  It's
also wrong on SGX1 when adding TCS pages since SECINFO.RWX bits for TCS
pages are forced to zero by hardware.

This simply doesn't work, e.g. the PENDING, MODIFIED and PR flags in the
SECINFO are read-only from a software perspective.
