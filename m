Yes, let's keep virtio words, which just calls notifications.

We considered using 1 feature bit of 24~37 to specify MSI capability, but

this feature bit only means for mmio transport layer, but not representing

comment feature negotiation of the virtio device. So we're not sure if 
this is a good choice.

When investigating kernel MSI behavior, I found in most case there's no 
action during IRQ affinity changes to avoid the interrupt coming.

For example, when migrate_one_irq, it masks the irq before 
irq_do_set_affinity. But for others, like user setting any irq affinity

via /proc/, it only holds desc->lock instead of disable/mask irq. In 
such case, how can it ensure the interrupt sending between writel ops?

This is just used for current MSI enabled/disabled status, after all MSI 
configurations setup finished.

Not for showing MSI capability.

In other words, since the concern of feature bit, we choose to update 
the virtio mmio

version that devices with v3 have MSI capability and notifications.
