I'm seeing this when building arm64 defconfig v5.4-rc1:

| [mark@lakrids:~/src/linux]% usekorg 8.1.0  make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux- -j56 -s
| arch/arm64/Makefile:62: CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT not defined or empty, the compat vDSO will not be built
| WARNING: "HYPERVISOR_platform_op" [vmlinux] is a static EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
| WARNING: "HYPERVISOR_platform_op" [vmlinux] is a static EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL

I couldn't see a follow-up; do you have a patch for this?

Thanks,
Mark.
