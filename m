Parity with ION will definitely be nice. For now, however, even if we achieve
that parity with UAPI and think about the cma-heap-as-module bit later, I
guess that's ok.

The real problem is the need for these heaps to be a module in the first
place.  I'd much rather have an upstream user to show the need for cache
maintenance operations that have been talked about so many times, so we can
make them happen for dma-buf-heaps in upstream. None of this has to be
a module if that happens :(.

The reason for the "modularization"  for ion heaps is also the CMOs for
Android use cases. Unfortunately we haven't had any luck with proving the
need for. John, CMIIW.
