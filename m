Anyone listed in MAINTAINERS is eligible to get an auto-approved account=20
on kernel.org, but they *must* satisfy the web of trust requirement:

- their key is signed by 2 other people who already have a kernel.org=20
  account (marginal trust), OR
- their key is signed by one of the following people (full trust):

  - H. Peter Anvin
  - Greg Kroah-Hartman
  - Ted Ts'o
  - Linus Torvalds
  - Dirk Hohndel
  - James Bottomley

Anyone who is not in MAINTAINERS but feel they should have an account on=20
kernel.org can still apply if they provide a reason behind their=20
request. Such cases are fairly rare and usually include collaboration on=20
non-kernel projects that are also hosted on kernel.org (there aren't=20
that many, but there are a few). The web of trust requirement is exactly=20
the same, but the final approval is not automatic. I forward these=20
requests to the above 6 people and it is sufficient for at least one=20
person to say "aye" for the account to be approved.

It is also important to highlight a distinction between "having an=20
account" and having a kernel.org email forwarding address. For this=20
particular case I was requested to provide a list of people with *active=20
accounts* on kernel.org, meaning that they have performed a git+ssh=20
operation within the past 12 months.

The LF IT admin team does not make any decisions -- all decisions are=20
taken by the above 6 people (unless the person is in MAINTAINERS, in=20
which case their approval is implicit).

I hope I helped clarify the procedure. Of course, as the person actually=20
creating accounts I'm the final arbiter of all decisions. If I had any=20
malicious intents, I could totally subvert the whole process -- so in=20
the end you just have to trust me to be on the side of "lawful good."
