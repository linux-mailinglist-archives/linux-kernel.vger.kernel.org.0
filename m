thanks. That's a good pointer I wasn't aware of.

Found them at https://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/+/master/tests/tests/hardware/res/raw

Of course, I had to find advantages to my own test suite (in case you
need to explain to management):
- I am running it upstream on any patch that comes in, so less chances
to catch a failure after the fact
- I am emulating the firmware more precisely IMO (it's a python class
and you can overwrite the set_report, get_report and set_output
report)
- I am emulating both USB and Bluetooth (or whatever bus you want)
- I am testing the LED classes
- we can easily extend to test the rumbles and the battery reporting
- I am not relying on preformatted reports, meaning that it's harder
to cheat in the driver and we can extend the test cases more easily
(what if we have a left d-pad + button 7 that runs into a problem in
the driver?)

Anyway, I just merged the PS3 controller I have. I'll try to see if I
can get the DS4 working based on those json files.

Cheers,
Benjamin
