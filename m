I think we collected all the missing pieces now :) Thanks!

Right, and I think the race I described won't happen in practice. Nobody=20
should be trying to do a get_page_unless_zero() on random pages that are=20
not even mapped to user space. I was (as so often) very careful :)

Yeah, and I think I can drop it from this patch.

Right, that should be guaranteed by d). (as long as people play by the=20
rules) Same applies to my current patch.

The only downside I see is that we get more false negatives on=20
has_unmovable_pages(), eventually resulting in the offlining stage after=20
isolation to loop forever (as some PageOffline() pages are not movable=20
(especially, XEN balloon, HyperV balloon), there won't be progress).

I somewhat don't like forcing everybody that uses PageOffline()=20
(especially all users of balloon compaction) to implement memory=20
notifiers just to avoid that. Maybe, we even want to use PageOffline()=20
in the future in the core (e.g., for memory holes instead of PG_reserved=20
or similar).

Thanks!
