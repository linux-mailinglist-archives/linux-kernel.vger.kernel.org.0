Paul, also what what happens in the following scenario:

CPU0                                                 CPU1

A syscall causes rcu_eqs_exit()
rcu_read_lock();
                                                     ---> FQS loop waiting on
						           dyntick_snap
usermode-upcall  entry -->causes rcu_eqs_enter();

usermode-upcall  exit  -->causes rcu_eqs_exit();

                                                     ---> FQS loop sees
						          dyntick snap
							  increment and
							  declares CPU0 is
							  in a QS state
							  before the
							  rcu_read_unlock!

rcu_read_unlock();
---

Does the context tracking not call rcu_user_enter() in this case, or did I
really miss something?

thanks,
