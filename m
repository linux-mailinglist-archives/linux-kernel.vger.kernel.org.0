I could mark

mm-pcp-share-common-code-between-memory-hotplug-and-percpu-sysctl-handler.patch
mm-meminit-recalculate-pcpu-batch-and-high-limits-after-init-completes.patch

as Cc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>	[4.1+]

But for backporting purposes it's a bit cumbersome that [2/3] is the
important patch.  I think I'll switch the ordering so that
mm-meminit-recalculate-pcpu-batch-and-high-limits-after-init-completes.patch
is the first patch and the other two can be queued for 5.5-rc1, OK?

Also, is a Reported-by:Matt appropriate here?


From: Mel Gorman <mgorman@techsingularity.net>
Subject: mm, meminit: recalculate pcpu batch and high limits after init completes

Deferred memory initialisation updates zone->managed_pages during the
initialisation phase but before that finishes, the per-cpu page allocator
(pcpu) calculates the number of pages allocated/freed in batches as well
as the maximum number of pages allowed on a per-cpu list.  As
zone->managed_pages is not up to date yet, the pcpu initialisation
calculates inappropriately low batch and high values.

This increases zone lock contention quite severely in some cases with the
degree of severity depending on how many CPUs share a local zone and the
size of the zone.  A private report indicated that kernel build times were
excessive with extremely high system CPU usage.  A perf profile indicated
that a large chunk of time was lost on zone->lock contention.

This patch recalculates the pcpu batch and high values after deferred
initialisation completes on each node.  It was tested on a 2-socket AMD
EPYC 2 machine using a kernel compilation workload -- allmodconfig and all
available CPUs.

mmtests configuration: config-workload-kernbench-max Configuration was
modified to build on a fresh XFS partition.

The patch reduces system CPU usage by 69.16% and total build time by
27.06%.  The variance of system CPU usage is also much reduced.
