Hello Pierre,

This patchset is pretty large - I'd suggest dividing next RFC into 
segments: debugfs, info, power-management, basic flow corrections and 
frame shape calculator.
Some commits have no messages and others lack additional info - tried to 
provide feedback wherever I could, though, especially for the last one, 
it would be vital to post additional info so in-depth feedback can be 
provided.

Maybe nothing for calculator will come up, maybe something will. In 
general I remember it being an essential part of SDW and one where many 
bugs where found during the initial verification phase.

Thanks for your contribution and have a good day!
Czarek
