Had a look at the crash trace from the mentioned patch.

Why can not we add a check for reg_read in bin_attr_nvmem_read() before 
dereferencing it?

The reason I ask this is because removing read_only is not that simple 
as you think.
Firstly because a there is no way to derive this flag by just looking at 
read/write callbacks.
Providers are much more generic drivers ex: at24 which can have 
read/write interfaces implemented, however read only flag is enforced at 
board/platform level config either via device tree property bindings or 
a write protection gpio.
Removing this is also going to break the device tree bindings.

only alternative I can see ATM is the mentioned check.
