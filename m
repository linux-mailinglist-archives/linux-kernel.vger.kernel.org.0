That code is explicitly without serialization. One memory barrier isn't
going to make any difference what so ever.

Specifically, those numbers will change _after_ we make it current, not
before.

There should not be, but even if there is, load-balancing in general
(very much including the NUMA balancing) is completely unserialized and
prone to reading stale data at all times.

This is on purpose; it minimizes the interference of load-balancing, and
if we make a 'wrong' choice, the next pass can fix it up.

Not in so far that we now both seem to agree on using
RCU_INIT_POINTER(); but we're still disagreeing on why.

My argument is that since we can already obtain any task_struct pointer
through find_task_by_vpid() and friends, any access to its individual
members must already have serialzation rules (or explicitly none, as for
load-balancing).

I'm viewing this as just another variant of find_task_by_vpid(), except
we index by CPU instead of PID. There can be changes to task_struct
between to invocations of find_task_by_vpid(), any user will have to
somehow deal with that. This is no different.

Take for instance p->cpus_ptr, it has very specific serialzation rules
(which that NUMA balancer thing blatantly ignores), as do a lot of other
task_struct fields.

The memory barrier in question isn't going to help with any of that.

Specifically, if we care about the consistency of the numbers changed by
pick_next_task(), we must acquire rq->lock (of course, once we do that,
we can immediately use rq->curr without further RCU use).
