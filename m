A tangent here: note that on POWER our IOMMU is paravirtualized
(updated with hypercalls), it's also always enabled.  For that reason
we can and do combine vIOMMU translation with the need for bounce
buffering for secure guests.

(We generally statically configure the vIOMMU to have a huge window
which just maps GPAs 1-to-1, which means we can still use dma-direct,
but the vIOMMU is still there from the platform point of view)
