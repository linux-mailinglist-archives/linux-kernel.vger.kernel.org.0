Oh, for lparstat usage, this is perfectly fine.

I meant that there could be other users of [s]purr who might care. I 
don't know of one, but since this is an existing sysfs interface, I 
wanted to point out that the behavior might change.

Right -- and that would be optimal requiring a single system call, at 
the cost of using a legacy interface.

The other option would be to drop this patch and to just go with patches 
1-5 introducing the new sysfs interfaces for idle_[s]purr. It isn't 
entirely clear how often this would be used, or its actual impact. We 
can perhaps consider this optimization if and when this causes 
problems...
