To make the object reused, we must ensure that no other pointers uses it
after kfree() release the pointer.
Scenario:
1). The object reused information is valid when no another pointer uses
it.
2). The object reused information is invalid when another pointer uses
it.
Do you mean that the object reused is scenario 1) ?
If yes, maybe we can change the calling quarantine_put() location. It
will be fully use that quarantine, but at scenario 2) it looks like to
need this patch.
If no, maybe i miss your meaning, would you tell me how to use invalid
object information? or?

we already used it on qemu and ran kasan UT. It look like ok.

Maybe, we can change it into GFP_KERNEL.

We will think it.

Duplicate information is solved after change the calling
quarantine_put() location.
