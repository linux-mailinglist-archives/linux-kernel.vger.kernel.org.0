It might be interesting to have a usbmon trace of a successful resume 
as well, for comparison.  However I suspect it would just show that 
the new Get-Device-Descriptor request worked and everything else 
continued on normally.

In fact it isn't, although in principle this shouldn't cause any
trouble.  It looks like your bluetooth device is deficient: It
sometimes crashes if it receives a Get-Device-Descriptor request while
it is busy with something else.

Still, since there was no real connection change at the port, there's
no reason to call hub_port_connect_change() here.  Let's see if the
patch below fixes your problem.
