Hi Leo,

There are a couple of typos in the comments below, but I also believe
that the sample loop could be considerably simplified

I believe the following change would work and make for easier reading...

.... at the start of the function remove instrs_executed and replace ....
/* get instructions remainder from previous packet */
u64 instrs_prev = tidq->period_instructions;

/* set available instructions to previous packet remainder + the
current packet count  */
tidq->period_instructions += tidq->packet->instr_count;


.... within the if(etm->sample_instructions && ...) statement I would
be more explicit what the elements of the diagram are ....

/*
 * Below diagram demonstrates the instruction samples
 * generation flows:
 *
 *    Instrs     Instrs       Instrs       Instrs
 *   Sample(n)  Sample(n+1)  Sample(n+2)  Sample(n+3)
 *    |            |            |            |
 *    V            V            V            V
 *   --------------------------------------------------
 *            ^                                  ^

 *    instructions(Pi)                   instructions(Pi')
 *
 *            |                                  |
 *            \---------------- -----------------/
 *                             V
 *                      tidq->packet->instr_count;
 *
 * Instrs Sample(n...) are the synthesised samples occuring every
etm->instructions_sample_period
 * instructions - as defined on the perf command line. Sample(n) being
the last sample before the
 * current etm packet, n+1 to n+3 samples generated from the current etm packet.
 *
 * tidq->packet->instr_count represents the number of instructions in
the current etm packet.
 *
 * Period instructions (Pi) contains the the number of instructions
executed after the sample point(n)
 * from the previous etm packet. This will always be less than
etm->instructions_sample_period.
 *

.... continue with explanation here ....


.... then we can simplify the loop code removing some of the temporary
variables ....

/* get the initial offset into the current packet instructions
   (entry conditions ensure that instrs_prev < etm->instructions_sample_period)
 */
u64 offset = etm->instructions_sample_period - instrs_prev;
u64 addr;

/* Prepare last branches for instruction sample */
if (etm->synth_opts.last_branch)
    cs_etm__copy_last_branch_rb(etmq, tidq);

while (tidq->period_instructions >= etm->instructions_sample_period) {

      /*
       * Calculate the address of the sampled instruction (-1
       * as sample is reported as though instruction has just
       * been executed, but PC has not advanced to next
       * instruction)
       */
    addr = cs_etm__instr_addr(etmq, trace_chan_id, tidq->packet, offset - 1);
    ret = cs_etm__synth_instruction_sample( etmq, tidq, addr,
                etm->instructions_sample_period);
    if (ret)
        return ret;

    offset += etm->instructions_sample_period;
    tidq->period_instructions -= etm->instructions_sample_period;
}

.....
I believe the above should work, but cannot claim to have tried it
out. What do you think?

Regards

Mike
