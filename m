In its current state I think it would not require any state apart from
the global flags, because MSRs can be extracted independent of
KVM_GET_NESTED_STATE; this may change as things are cleaned up, but if
that remains the case there would be no need for SVM structs at all.

It's just for namespace cleanliness.  I'm keeping VMCS12_SIZE for the
arch/x86/kvm/vmx/ code because it's shorter and we're used to it, but
userspace headers should use a more specific name.
