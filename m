In general I don't have a good answer for you, but:

* The fact that nobody noticed that things were pretty broken here
implies that probably nobody is regularly testing mickey on upstream
and presumably nobody is testing mickey on stable, so likely it
doesn't matter a whole lot.

* The original mickey dts was from "Thu Dec 3 16:55:40 2015 +0100"
based upon kernel 4.4.  That means there were 10 kernel revisions
between it at 4.14.  If I had to guess without testing, I'd guess that
4.14 is still better off with this patch than without.
