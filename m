Right, sorry, I looked only at the title when checked if it's in the
tree or not.

I did not find anything that could serve as these X/Y here. Commit
hashes in linux-next are pointless and won't match against other
trees. Commit titles seem to be the best bet for kernel, but this is
exactly the case where they fall short.

But in this case I think we can safely mark this as:

#syz fix:
simple_recursive_removal(): kernel-side rm -rf for ramfs-style filesystems

This should work because syzbot does coarser-grained check than "if
you see that behaviour on a tree that doesn't contain X". Instead it
will wait until _all_ tested trees will have X and only then close the
bug and report it again if it sees it again. Since the commit is
already fixed in linux-next, when all trees including mainline and
bpf/bpf-next will get it, it should be the fixed version.

I did not get the relation of folding to bisection. Or you mean these
are just separate things?
In this particular case the reason seems to be the same as for most
kernel bisections -- too many unrelated bugs layering one onto
another.
If you are interested in more details about why kernel bisection go
wrong in general, I've published a bunch of info here (including
detailed stats on reason):
