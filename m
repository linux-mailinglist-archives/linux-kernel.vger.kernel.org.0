Hi Mathieu,
Nice to hear from you. I replied below:

It feels like here you are kind of forcing tracepoint callbacks on what to
do. Why should we limit what tracepoint callbacks want to do? Further if the
callback indirectly calls some other kernel API that does use rcu_read_lock(), then it
is trouble again. I would rather make callbacks more robust, than having us
force down unwritten / undocumented rules onto them. BPF in their callbacks
also use rcu_read_lock from what I remember (but I'll have to double check).

I kind of got lost here. The SRCU synchronization in current code is for
tracepoint_srcu which is for the tracepoint function table. Perf can't rely
on _that_ "underlying" synchronization. That is for a completely different
SRCU domain.

I think what you're proposing is:
1. Perf use its own SRCU domain and synchronize on that.
2. We remove rcu_irq_enter_irqson() for *rcuidle cases and just use SRCU in
all callbacks.

Is that right?

I think Peter said he does now want / like a separate SRCU domain within Perf
so that sounds like settled ;-)

Further what if a tracepoint callback calls into some code that does
preempt_disable() and exepects that to be an RCU read-side section? That will
get hosed too since RCU is not watching.

I would say RCU _has_ to watch callback code to be fair to them. Anything
else is a cop out IMO.

But rcu_irq_enter() was added right back thus nulling that benefit.

But such SRCU implementation / usage has to be done within the callback
itself (for syscalls in this case), that has nothing to do with removing SRCU
for tracepoint_srcu (the table). Perhaps for the syscall case, we can add a
new trace_ API specifically for SRCU that does the rcu_irq_enters_on() call
but does not do preempt_disable_notrace() before calling callbacks, thus
allowing the callback to handle page faults? And such new trace_ API can call
srcu_read_{,un}lock() on an SRCU domain specific to the tracepoint,
before/after the callback invocation.

thanks,
