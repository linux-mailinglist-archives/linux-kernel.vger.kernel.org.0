yes, multi-link is definitively required and one of the main appeals of 
SoundWire. We have a platform with 2 amplifiers on separate links and 
they need to be synchronized and handled with the stream concept.

The tentative plan would be to move the stream allocation to the dailink 
.init (or equivalent), and make sure each DAI in that link used the same 
stream information. There are dependencies on the multi-cpu concept that 
Morimoto-san wanted to push, so we'll likely be the first users.

For the DAI trigger, we will need to change the existing API so that a 
sdw_stream_enable() can be called multiple times, but only takes effect 
when the .trigger of the first DAI in the stream is invoked. This is a 
similar behavior than with HDaudio .trigger operations when the SYNC 
bits are used.

We will do this when we have a first pass working with all codec drivers 
upstream and a basic machine driver upstream with all 4 links working 
independently.

Everything is done in public btw, you can track our WIP solutions here:
