If 'date' didn't get scheduled, there will be no output at all unless
all those workload threads finished :-)

I guess the workload you used is not entirely CPU intensive, or 'date'
can be totally blocked due to START_DEBIT. But note that START_DEBIT
isn't the problem here, cross CPU vruntime comparison is.

No.
