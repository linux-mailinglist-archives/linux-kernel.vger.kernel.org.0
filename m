I had a quick look and I don't think there are ERETS in function 
symbols. And, worst case scenario, I could also just keep the arm64 
decoder making ERETS as INSN_CONTEXT_SWITCH as I didn't need more 
semantics so far (and arm64 ERET don't affect the stack anyway).

After you pointed out this only affect this very specific pattern, I 
admit that my concerns are more about "not having weird stuff in the 
generic part".
If it's too much of a hassle I can understand if you prefer to just put 
a comment. But if most of this can be kept to the arch specific decoder 
I think it'd be nicer :) .

Thanks, keep me in Cc if you post a new version using that!
