I have looked at the patch, but have not tested it.

I am worried that the getrandom delays will be serialized, because 
processes sometimes run one after another. If there are enough 
chained/dependent processes that ask for randomness before it is ready, 
the end result is still a too-big delay, essentially a failed boot.

In other words: your approach of adding delays only makes sense for 
heavily parallelized boot, which may not be the case, especially for 
embedded systems that don't like systemd.
