Changing text in an existing paragraph can
result in line lengths that are inconsistent and ragged, leading to a less 
pleasant appearance
and the temptation to "refill" the paragraph so that the 
lines are all approximately equal in length.  The problem with yielding
to that temptation is that it messes up
the diff output so that you can no longer easily see the actual
text changes that were made.

Thus, when making such changes, it can be better to not refill the
paragraphs - as, indeed, you did not.  But if the result becomes too
difficult to read (as in, it creates lines that are waaaay to long), it
can be good to create a second patch that makes only the cosmetic changes
without any associated text changes.  I was suggesting doing that in this
case.

Does that help?

Thanks,

jon
