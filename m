Ok, that is not necessary. I was just surprised that you don't trust
register writes to work.

I'm with you so far ...

... but I don't understand this part. If BRCM_RESCAL_START is read as 0
at this point, we end up writing (0 ^ 1) == 1.

Yes, please.

There are cases where the abstraction doesn't fit perfectly, but usually
it is the consumer driver that knows best whether the hardware just
needs to be made responsive by deasserting the reset line, or whether
triggering a reset procedure is required to initialize some internal
state.
