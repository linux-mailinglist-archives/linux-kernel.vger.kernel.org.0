When the TAB charter was written (in 2006), the original reason was to
prevent manipulation (real or imagined) by the committee who would then
become the arbiters of nominations and thus able to influence who might
run for the TAB.  There are a couple of reasons for the electorate
clause: when the TAB was formed, it was done by the kernel developers
unhappy at the way OSDL (precursor organization to the LF) was behaving
with regard to the kernel, who forced their way onto its board and
formed the TAB to gain input and control on behalf of kernel
developers, so the TAB was formed by kernel developer for kernel
developers and, since most other non-kernel open source groups had
their own foundation like entities, keeping it kernel only wasn't seen
as a problem.  The other reason was that OSDL was a bit unhappy to be
reformed in this way and we foresaw that one way to dilute the
reforming influence of the TAB would be to dilute kernel developer
representation since they were the main community interested in that
reform.  When the OSDL became the LF, some of the initial antagonism
and need for reform went away and the elections were opened to the co-
located conferences as a sign of improved trust.
