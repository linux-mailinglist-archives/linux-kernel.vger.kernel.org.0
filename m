I agree that this could potentially violate inviarants, but
InitFastPerCpu is not intended to be called by the application.

We have a bit of an opportunity to figure out whether this is the
first time--from TCMalloc's perspective--a thread is doing per-CPU and
bump the __rseq_count accordingly.  I think this could be done off of
the fast path.
