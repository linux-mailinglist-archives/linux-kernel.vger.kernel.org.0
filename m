Hi Chris,

I have another idea about global shrink priority.

In the memory-constrained and complex multitasking environment such as an Android system may require more complex performance priority.
For example, the tasks of app in the font, they need high priority because low priority will affect the user experience at once.
The tasks of app in background should have lower priority than the first one.  And sometime, each app should have different priority.  Because some apps are frequently used.  They should have high priority than other background apps.
The daemons should have lower priority than background apps.  Because most of them will not affect the user experience.

Do you think this environment is suitable for global shrink priority.

Best,
Hui
