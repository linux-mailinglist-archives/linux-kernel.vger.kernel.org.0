I think it's doable to pass it through to KVM. The difficulty is to disable
split lock detection in KVM because that will disable split lock on
the whole core including threads for the host. Without disabling split lock
in KVM, it's doable to debug split lock in KVM.

Sean and Xiaoyao are working on split lock for KVM (in separate patch set).
They may have insight on how to do this.

Thanks.
