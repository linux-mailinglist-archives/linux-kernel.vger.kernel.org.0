Dear whoeveryouare,

can you please state in a clearer form (more understandable to non-native
english talkers) what your true opinion on the topic is?
And in case you did not understand what I was saying, here is clearer form of
my opinion:

A kernel module with another license (be it whatsoever) is _no_ modification
of the kernel, but an extension of its features. If feature-extension is
against the GPL (which I seriously doubt) then I would say "go back onto your
trees". Because the human race and evolution is about little else than
feature-extension.

And another thing: court is for lawyers. Whenever the lawyers take over
something they don't (want to) understand the end is near ...

How about talking with real names? I have no idea why you spam rms or bruce
with this, as the question is all about _one_ project, namely linux-kernel.
I'd suggest taking them off this topic again ...

Regards,
Stephan
