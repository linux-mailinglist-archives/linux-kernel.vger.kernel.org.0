One pattern I have seen here is temporary variables from macros or
inline functions whose lifetime now extends over the entire function
rather than just the basic block in which they are defined, see e.g.
lpfc_debug_dump_qe() being inlined multiple times into
lpfc_debug_dump_all_queues(). Each instance of the local
"char line_buf[LPFC_LBUF_SZ];" seems to add on to the previous
one now, where the behavior without the structleak plugin is that
they don't.
