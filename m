Events such as the FPU pipe assignment ones are not
included in the above docs.  So can you add this one
to your list of references, since it has them listed?:

Omit the trailing " to Pipe 3.", since this one's umask
represents all pipes.  Feel free to add "all pipes" instead.
I realize this isn't a line you're adding, but since we're
here, we might as well fix it.

Please concatenate " Total3: Total number uOps assigned to Pipe 3." to the above string.

Hm, PMCx041 didn't exist when I wrote commit 0e3b74e26280
"perf/x86/amd: Update generic hardware cache events for Family 17h",
and their counts don't seem to match up very well when running
various workloads.  The microarchitecture is likely to have changed
in this area from families prior to 17h, so a MAB alloc can likely
count different events than what is presumed here: a Data cache
load/store/prefetch miss.

I think it's safer to just leave the PPR text "LS MAB Allocates
by Type" as-is, instead of assuming they are L1 load/store misses.
What do you think?

I'll review patches 1-2 tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kim
