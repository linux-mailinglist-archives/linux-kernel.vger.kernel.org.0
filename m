Two significant concerns right off the bat:

- It seems more common than not for silicon designers to fail to 
implement IIDR correctly, so it's only a matter of time before 
inevitably needing to bring back some firmware-level identifier 
abstraction (if not already - does Hi161x have PMCGs?)

- This seems like a step in entirely the wrong direction for supporting 
PMCGs that reference a Named Component or Root Complex.

Interpreting the Node Reference is definitely a welcome improvement over 
matching table headers, but absent a truly compelling argument to the 
contrary, I'd rather retain the "PMCG model" abstraction in between that 
and the driver itself (especially since those can trivially be hung off 
compatibles once it comes to DT support).

Thanks,
Robin.
