Actually, the libc.so data section is a file mapping, so I think
can_do_pageout() would decide whether the caller is allowed to force
pageout based on whether the caller is the owner of (or capable over)
libc (in other words, root, basically). But I think the bss section,
as well as heap memory, could have pageout forced by anyone.
