Yes, it will require some code changes but nevertheless, it can properly track
early boot time added memory and differentiate it from runtime added memory. I
am not saying we will have to go in this direction but it will be one of the
viable generic ways to enumerate boot memory. IIUC the other existing method is
through firmware memory map.

Only problem will be unlike memblock or firmware memory map, it does not get
updated after each memory hot add or remove operation.

OR the firmware itself can rewrite it's own table in memory after performing
memory hotplug operations. But lets take a step back. The basic question here
would be "What should the new kexec kernel get in terms of memory resources".

There can be two options

1. Memory state as available at runtime

	- Seems logical unless kexec kernel has to be associated with boot resources
	- Requires tracking the changes some where, either in kernel or firmware
	- If kernel has to track this in a generic way, there are some options 

		- memblock lists all accessible memory but does not identify boot memory
		- firmware memmap

	- If kexec needs resource enumeration from firmware table, then it requires re-write

		- Either in memory hotplug path as with existing firmware memory map
		- OR firmware updates the table itself after driving memory hotplug operation

2. Memory state as available at boot

	- If boot memory has been removed

		- Platform must guarantee they are still accessible to next kexec kernel
		- This is highly unlikely because

			- DIMM might be taken out e.g resource trimming, error handling 
			- DIMM might be reassigned to other guests in virtualization

	- If new memory added

		- Not problematic, new kexec kernel will not use this additional memory

			- Just resource wastage from platform perspective

Is there any reason why firmware cannot update these tables (UEFI memory map or DT memory
node) after driving memory hotplug operation ?

Okay, but again the point is if hot-plug is driven by firmware why cant it just update
the resource table ? What is rationale of having values in there which does not correctly
represent the entire addressable memory range anymore.

All these are kernel allocations and they are always protected either being on non movable
zones or with PG_reserved set. AFAICS these pages cannot be isolated, migrated or removed.
So the protection comes from kernel because of their zone classification or allocation
method (memblock_reserve etc).

That will be a more fundamental change in the way memory is handled during boot. AFAICS,
we dont have to go in that direction.

But all these should be protected because their current allocation and usage
(i.e ZONE_NORMAL, PG_reserved etc).

As we mentioned before, if the kexec needs to inherent runtime memory resources
instead of boot time, then changed memory resources will have to be tracked
either in Linux or in firmware which kexec can refer.

Kexec tool reads memory resource enumeration from first running kernel and
presents that to new kexec kernel. It can read what ever format it wants (EUFI
memory map, DT, memblock, firmware memory map) but presents in way which kexec
kernel can use (EUFI memory map, DT). Both formats need not be the same.

> of linux that doesn't support hotplug not to overwrite it?

If the running kernel does not support hotplug, nothing updates the memory map.
It remains unchanged from boot. If the kexec kernel does not support hotplug, it
is irrelevant because it will just consume memory as presented from the first
running kernel which remains the same through out it's runtime.

There is a mechanism in ACPI for this i.e ACPI_SRAT_MEM_HOT_PLUGGABLE.

Lets re-evaluate the situation here from scratch. Memory can be classified as
boot and runtime because it impacts the way in which kernel allocations, zone
initializations are treated. Boot memory deals with kernel allocation before
zone init happens where as runtime memory might choose which zone to get into
right away.

(1) Boot memory

	- Non-movable

		- Normal memblocks
		- All kernel allocations come here
		- Become ZONE_NORMAL/DMA/DMA32 at runtime

			- Never removable because isolation and hence migration impossible
			- Removal protection because of the zone classification

	- Movable	(ACPI_SRAT_MEM_HOT_PLUGGABLE)

		- Memblock will be marked with MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG
		- Memblock allocations tried to be avoided (reversing the memblock order etc)
		- Become ZONE_MOVABLE at runtime

			- Removable  [1]

(2) Runtime memory


	- Removable
		- Can become ZONE_NORMAL

			- Never removable because isolation and hence migration impossible
			- Removal protection because of the zone classification

		- Can become ZONE_MOVABLE

			- Removable [2]


We dont have to worry about non-movable boot memory as they are protected
against removal because of their zone and subsequent usage. Hence even if
the firmware attempts (which it should not), it cannot be removed.

[1] Remove hotpluggable boot memory

Firmware should only attempt to remove memory which was tagged as hotpluggable
ACPI_SRAT_MEM_HOT_PLUGGABLE in the SRAT table. The entire discussion here, is
how to handle only this particular situation. Though DT based systems might
also have similar concerns, if they support hotpluggable boot memory.

a) Platform decides not to support removal of hotpluggable memory

Platform can have a policy not to either give hotpluggable memory regions or
not to attempt removing them even if given. This is a purely a firmware centric
platform solution without requiring any changes to current memory hot-remove code.

b) Platform decides to support removal of hotpluggable memory

As mentioned before, free_hotplug_page_range() will have to handle PG_reserved
pages while freeing. But kexec also needs to understand part of the boot memory
is inaccessible now and should not be passed to the next kernel. This will
require tracking boot memory changes in EUFI memory map or DT nodes or membock
or firmware memory map, updated either by kernel or firmware itself.

[2] Remove hotpluggable runtime memory

There are no similar problems here. If runtime added memory is never going to
be part of the kexec enumeration, it does not even matter whether these memory
are removed or not.
