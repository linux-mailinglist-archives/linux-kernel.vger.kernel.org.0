Hi Steffen,

I'm working on some padata patches and stumbled across this thread about the
purpose of the callback CPU in padata_do_parallel.

    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20100402112326.GA19502@secunet.com/

The relevant part is,

Not too familiar with IPsec, but I'm guessing it's interesting to separate the
flows for performance reasons.  Is the goal to keep multiple flows from
interfering with each other (ensuring they run on different CPUs), or maybe to
get better locality (ensuring each always runs on the same CPU)?  It'd be
helpful if you could expand on this.

By the way, the padata patches extend the code to parallelize more places
around the kernel, as Peter suggested.

Thanks,
Daniel
