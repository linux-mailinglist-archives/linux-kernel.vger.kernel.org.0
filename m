Well it could be necessary to reset if userspace messes up and sends a 
bad host address for example, so that's why I'd like to have it 
available to userspace.

That doesn't work for non-blocking io.

OK, I just didn't quite get what you meant by protected. Yes, multiple 
reads here of in_progress must be serialized so that only one thread 
sees it go false at once. This prevents multiple transfers from being 
started while one is in progress. But writing it doesn't require locking 
that I can see.

Not what I meant, was trying to say better to lock before waiting 
(rather than after). However now that I think again, that wouldn't work 
to prevent multiple transfers being started while one is in progress.

This gets more complicated than that because we need non-blocking io; 
the mutex can't be held while the client call exits with EAGAIN.
