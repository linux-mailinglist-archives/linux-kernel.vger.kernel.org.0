When passing the return value of dev_to_node() to cpumask_of_node()
without checking the node id if the node id is not valid, there is
global-out-of-bounds detected by KASAN as below:

there are different checking to return value of dev_to_node(), I though
it is better to consistently do checking in cpumask_of_node(), then
discussion [1] [2] led to do the checking in device_add().
