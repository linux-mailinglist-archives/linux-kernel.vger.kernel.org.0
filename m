We set the MTRR default to writeback cacheable, and then use variable
MTRRs to mark certain parts of the address map as uncacheable.  The
uncacheable regions are at the top of the address map (AEP mailboxes,
PCIe config segments other than segment zero, MMRs, 64-bit MMIO) and
from 2GB to 4GB.  There are also uncacheable ranges below 1MB
controlled by the fixed MTRRs.

I've added asterisks after the entries that represent the reserved
areas that weren't being respected.  This map is from a relatively
small system.  The number of these reserved areas and their size vary
based on the number of NUMA nodes and, if I remember correctly, the
amount of memory in each node as well.

> The BIOS is normally expected to mark the relevant ranges as UC in

The MTRRs do not scale for this purpose; there are not enough of them
left over to handle a reserved area for each of the NUMA nodes in a
fully configured system.  Also, the pieces we reserve do not usually
follow the alignment requirements of the MTRRs, so using them would
require tossing out a good deal of usable memory.

I think you may be misreading what the patches do.  They do not change
any allocation of memory, only (1) reduce the valid area of the page
tables used for early mapping of the kernel image down to the
addresses actually occupied by the kernel image (to the granularity of
2MB PMD pages, anyway), and (2) ensure that KASLR doesn't place the
kernel image where the last 2MB page used to map it would also cross a
reserved space boundary (and therefore include some BIOS reserved space
in the mapped region).

If I missed something and I am actually chopping off a bunch of
memory, please let me know.

Later refinement of the page tables set up in early boot has not
changed.

Those are set up much later, this problem is very early in booting. As
far as I have seen, all of the later code that sets up memory respects
the EFI and/or E820 tables the BIOS passes in.  This early boot code
did not, and left a small window where the reserved addresses get
mapped and cause problems.
