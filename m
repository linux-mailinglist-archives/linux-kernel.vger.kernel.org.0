Specifically my worry is that "ARCH_SIFIVE" makes it sound like we're adding
SiFive-specific architecture features, and we've been trying really hard to
make sure that the various bits of core software avoid boing vendor specific.
We've had suggestions of adding vendor-specific instructions to the Linux port
with those instructions being conditionally compiled under ARCH_$VENDOR, but
I'd rejected that under the "no vendor-specific stuff" argument.  As such it
doesn't seem fair to go add in an ARCH_SIFIVE for our vendor-specific stuff.

The SOC stuff will, of course, be vendor specific.  In this idealized world
SiFive's SOC support has nothing to do with RISC-V, but of course all of
SiFive's SOCs are RISC-V based so the separation is a bit of pedantry.  That
said, in this case I think getting the name right does make it slightly easier
to espouse this "one kernel can run on all RISC-V systems" philosophy.
Balancing the SiFive and RISC-V stuff can be a bit tricky, which is why I am
sometimes a bit pedantic about these sorts of things.

I'd be happy with something like that.  We'd also talked about this selecting
all the SiFive platform drivers.  It should, of course, be possible to select
multiple SOC vendors in a single kernel -- we don't have any other real
hardware right now, but maybe some sort of "CONFIG_SOC_RISCV_VIRT" would be a
good proof of concept?
