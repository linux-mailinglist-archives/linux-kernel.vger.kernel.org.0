One option, probably a lot saner (if we care at all, after all, copying 8K
really isn't that much, but it might have some impact on real-time processes,
which is one of the rather few use cases for direct I/O) would be to keep the
bitmask in a pre-formatted TSS (ioperm being per thread, so no concerns about
the TSS being in use on another processor), and copy the TSS fields (88 bytes)
over if and only if the thread has been migrated to a different CPU, then
switch the TSS rather than switching  For the common case (no ioperms) we use
the standard per-cpu TSS.

That being said, I don't actually know that copying 88 bytes + LTR is any
cheaper than copying 8K.
