Yes. makes sense. Device that cannot handle 64bit dma mask will not work.

Well, an accidental unintented page leak to the hypervisor, is a very
bad thing, regardless of any DMA mapping. The device may not be able to
access it, but the hypervisor still can access it.

Hmm... i not sure how to accomplish (2).   we need use some DDW window
to setup the mappings. right?  If disable_ddw is set, there wont be any
ddw.  What am i missing?

I have been experimenting with this.  Trying to map only the memory
range from io_tlb_start/io_tlb_end though the 64-bit ddw window.  But
due to some reason, it wants the io_tlb_start to be aligned to some
boundary. It looks like a 2^28 boundary. Not sure what dictates that
boundary.

Yes i will put a warning message to indicate the failure.

educate me a bit here. What is a non-DDW case?  is it possible for a
device to acccess memory, in the presence of a IOMMU, without a window-mapping?
