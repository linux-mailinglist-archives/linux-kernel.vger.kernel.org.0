Hi David,

While it is easy to construct a scenario where a memblock belongs to multiple
nodes, I have to confess that I yet have not seen that in a real-world scenario.

Given said that, I think that the less risky way is to just drop the nodemask_t
and do not care about calling sysfs_remove_link() for already removed links.
As I said, sysfs_remove_link() will silently fail when it fails to find the
symlink, so I do not think it is a big deal.
