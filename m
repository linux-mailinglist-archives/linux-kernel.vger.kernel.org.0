Hi,

chained to this message is a driver for CH7033 along with device tree
binding docs.

Since the initial submission, issues pointed out in Laurent Pinchart's
review [1] were addressed. Details in individual patches' change log.
At his suggestion, the driver has been made to use bridge/display-connect=
or.
This allowed removing some fat, but for the time being it means that the=20
patches apply against Laurent's branch [2] instead of master or drm-next.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191220074914.249281-1-lkundrak@v3.sk/
[2] omapdrm/bridge/devel branch (at d27b7b2098de5) of
    git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/media.git

Tested to work well on MMP3-based Dell Wyse 3020. There's no datasheet or
programming manual available.

Thanks,
Lubo
