Yes, a PPI is ideal (since it allows core to see its own local interrupt).

Hmm, I had thought that had been done already, but apparently not. Looks 
like it's high time for another round of event map updates for the 
latest Cortex and Neoverse cores, so I guess I'll add that to our 
backlog internally - although the PMU events should be in the public 
TRMs so if anyone else *did* fancy ploughing through them to spin 
patches they're always welcome to :)

In the meantime the generic PMUv3 compatible will at least expose the 
subset of mandatory architectural events, which is arguably more useful 
than nothing.

FWIW the age of the DT shouldn't really be relevant - it's a question of 
whether the platform's EL3 firmware actually implements the PSCI 1.0 (or 
later) spec, or is some fossilised binary based on the older version.

Robin.
