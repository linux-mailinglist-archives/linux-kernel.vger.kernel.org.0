That is an extremely specific corner case that is not likely to occur.
NUMA balancing is not going to migrate a MADV_FREE page under these
circumstances as a write cancels MADV_FREE is read attempt will probably
fail to allocate a destination page in alloc_misplaced_dst_page so the
data gets lost instead of remaining remote. sys_movepages is a possibility
but the circumstances of an application delibertly trying to migrate to
a loaded node is low. Compaction never migrates cross-node so the state
of a remote node under pressure do not matter.

Once again, there needs to be a reasonable use case to be able to
meaningfully balance between the benefits and risks of changing the
MADV_FREE semantics.
