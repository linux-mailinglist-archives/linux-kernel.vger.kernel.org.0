Heh, I'm fairly confident the 20-year-old drivers are probably 
well-debugged by now anyway - it's the future low-end SoCs for 
Linux-powered IoT shoelaces that I see being a rich vein of new bugs :)

How does this look to start with? (only compile-tested so far, but I'll 
pick it up again properly next week)

Subject: [PATCH] dma/debug: Size hash table dynamically

Having a fixed-size hash table fails to scale nicely - making it large
enough to perform well for the mapping behaviour of big network adapters
tends towards unreasonable memory consumption for smaller systems. It's
logical to size the table for the number of expected entries, and doing
so conveniently puts the size/performance tradeoff in the hands of the
user via the "dma_debug_entries" option. The dynamic allocation also
sidesteps the issue of the static array bloating the kernel image on
certain platforms.
