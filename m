We already have other explicit differences between clone() and clone3().
And these differences are intentional. Two examples are that CSIGNAL is
not a valid flag anymore (due to .exit-signal) and CLONE_DETACHED will
not be simply ignored anymore but will get you EINVAL. So that shouldn't
be a concern.

I think we really want the minimal thing and only for clone3 right now:
verify whether any high-bits are set and whether it's a valid signal.
clone3() needs to have correct semantics when released!

Legacy clone on the other hand already has this buggy behavior for
n-years. It can have it for a little while longer so we can see whether
userspace relies on it.
