As already said, having thermal related clock shift operation in
update_thermal_load_avg and pelt.c is a nack for me

In fact, trigger_thermal_pressure_average is only there because of
shifting the clock which is introduced only in patch 6.
So remove trigger_thermal_pressure_average from this patch and call directly

+       update_thermal_load_avg(rq_clock_task(rq), rq,
+                               per_cpu(thermal_pressure, cpu_of(rq)));

in patch3
