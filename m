I'll try the PB190 first anyway. It should be easier due to not needing
to setup a monitor. I'm not sure if I ever booted Linux on either of
them, since I acquired both about the time I started getting too busy
to spend time on such things. I just found the Performa, and it's actually
a Performa 630CD but I don't see any obvious difference based on the specs.

I just took a look at the macide driver, and it appears to do basically
nothing other than pass a list of addresses into the core ide code. It's
one of the smallest drivers I've ever seen.

I should pull out every machine in my collection and look for those sorts
of issues. None of them have been checked in at least 5 or 6 years.
