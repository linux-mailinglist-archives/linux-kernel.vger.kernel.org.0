Thanks comment,     I will send revise rev.

I will change prefix from "TH85" to "TH58" .  Since this is typo.

    The 8Gbit type "TH58CxG3S0HRAIJ" is new to Kioxia's serial NAND lineup
    and the prefix was changed from "TC58" to "TH58".

    Thus the functions were renamed from tc58cxgxsx_*() to
    tx58cxgxsxraix_*().

Thanks,
