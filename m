This patch updates the PMCs for AMD Zen1 core based processors (Family
17h; Models 0 through 2F) to be in accordance with PMCs as
documented in the latest versions of the AMD Processor Programming
Reference [1], [2] and [3]. Note that some events, such as FPU pipe
assignment are missing in [1], and therefore [3] is included for full
coverage of events.

PMCs added:
fpu_pipe_assignment.dual{0|1|2|3}
fpu_pipe_assignment.total{0|1|2|3}
ls_mab_alloc.dc_prefetcher
ls_mab_alloc.stores
ls_mab_alloc.loads
bp_dyn_ind_pred
bp_de_redirect

PMC removed:
ex_ret_cond_misp

Cumulative counts, fpu_pipe_assignment.total and
fpu_pipe_assignment.dual, existed in v1, but did expose port-level
counters.

ex_ret_cond_misp has been removed as it has been removed from the latest
versions of the PPR, and when tested, always seems to sample zero as
tested on a Ryzen 3400G system.

Changes in v2:
    - Correct the UMasks for fpu_pipe_assignment.dual* by left shifting
    all by 4 bits.
    - Correct UMask for ls_mab_alloc.loads
    - add bp_dyn_ind_pred (PMC0x08E)
    - add bp_de_redirect  (PMC0x091)
Changes in v3:
    - Correct the pipe numbers for fpu_pipe_assignment counters
    - Correct ls_mab_alloc.* public descriptions
