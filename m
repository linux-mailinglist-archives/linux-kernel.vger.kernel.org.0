Yes, I'm currently working on the dt-binding changes.

It may take another couple of months for her to return, we'd like to complete the current patches since these have been active for quite long time (almost one year).

Yes, I followed the notes but apparently have missed some important steps. I'll go the above document and get it fixed.

The new patches are expected in a couple of days.
