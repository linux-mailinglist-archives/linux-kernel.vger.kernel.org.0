Ok, will do.

Indeed. I think I will change it to something like this.

title: 'FSL CPU DAI for resource management'

The explanation are already in patch 2/2 of this series but let e
explain again what I'm
trying to do here and let me know if this makes sense to you.

Digital Audio Interface device (DAI) are configured by the firmware
running on the DSP. The only
trouble we have is that we cannot easily handle 'resources' like:
clocks, pinctrl, power domains from
firmware.

This is because our architecture is like this:

M core [running System Controller Firmware]
            |
            |
A core [Linux]<----> DSP core [SOF firmware]

In theory, it is possible for DSP core to communicate with M core, but
this needs a huge
amount of work in order to make it work. We have this on our plans for
the future,
but we are now trying to do resource management from A core because
the infrastructure is already in place.

So, the curent driver introduced in this series acts like a Generic
resource driver for DAI device. We can
have multiple types of DAIs but most of them need the same types of
resources (clocks, pinctrl, pm) sof
for this reason I made it generic.

We already have a DSP node: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dsp/fsl,dsp.yaml
but I thought that the resources attached to DAIs are separated from
the resources
attached to the DSP device.

In the great scheme of ALSA we usually have things like this:

FE         <----->       BE

In the SOF world FE are defined by topology framework. Back ends are
defined by the machine driver:

On the BE side we have:
- codec  -> this is the specific code
- platform -> this is the DSP
- cpu -> this is our Generic DAI device

Now, I'm wondering if we can get rid of cpu here and make platform
node (dsp) take care of every
resource (this looks not natural).

Perhaps Mark, Liam or Pierre can help me with this.

As I said above this is not about the DSP, but about the Digital Audio
Intraface. On i.MX
NXP boards we have two types of DAIs: SAI and ESAI.

Great.

We support multiple power domains, so technically there is no upper
limit. What should I put here in this case?

Topology files are binary blobs that contain the description of an
audio pipeline. They are built
are written in a specific format and compiled with alsa-tplg tools in userspace.

Then loaded via firmware interface inside the kernel.
