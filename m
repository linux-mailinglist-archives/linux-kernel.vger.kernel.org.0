Agreed, I just remembered that I checked this a while ago and found that
we always control the SS_LEVEL bit, but never anything else. But indeed
irrelevant for this.

That's what I figured ;-)

OK, will post it.

Really? Where is that? In Linux, or in U-Boot, possibly with the caches
off? I am just curious. AFAIK there are some inefficient algorithms in
libfdt (which trade performance for a smaller memory footprint), but I
thought those would be called only very rarely.

I see it is preferable over creating a separate copy of the .dts file.

Yeah, Chen-Yu mentioned that already. Thanks for the info, I missed that.

Yeah, that was a New-Year's brain-fart of mine ;-)

While I was changing the patch I figured that it gets quite lengthy.
Also looking at the a20.dtsi, I see that *all* pin groups have this tag
now. Wouldn't it be easier to introduce *one* tag that applies that to
all children of a node?

Another thing I was wondering about: Would we gain something by not
compiling nodes which have status = "disabled"? This is mentioned as a
generic property in the DT spec, although it says there that the exact
meaning is device dependent. But it sound still worthwhile, especially
since we would avoid more pin groups to be compiled in.

Cheers,
Andre.
