After applied Tom's patch, i changed the reserved memory(for crash kernel) to the
above 256M(>256M), such as crashkernel=320M or 384M,512M..., the kdump kernel can
work and successfully dump the vmcore.

But the kdump kernel always happened the panic or could not boot successfully in
the 256M(<= 256M) case, and on HP machine, i noticed that it printed OOM, the kdump
kernel was too smaller memory. But i never see the OOM on speedway machine(probably
related to the earlyprintk, it doesn't work and it loses many logs).

After removing the option 'CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO' from .config, i tested again, the kdump
kernel did not happen the panic in the 256M(crashkernel=256M), the kdump kernel can
work and succeed to dump the vmcore on HP machine or speedway machine.

It seems that the small memory caused the previous failure in kdump kernel. I would
suggest to post this patch to upstream. What's your opinion? Tom, Baoquan and other
people. Or do you have any comment?

Thanks.
Lianbo
