Hello.

What do you mean by origin protection? (I'm starting to see some
misunderstanding here, c.f. my remark regarding the parent=3D=3Droot
condition in the other patch [1]).

Hopefully, I see where are you coming from. There would be no (false)
low notifications if the elow was calculated all they way top-down from
the real root. Would such calculation be the way to go?

Yes, I agree.

If a job wants to use concrete protection than it sets it, if it wants
to use protection from above, then it can express it with the infinity
(after changing the effective calculation I described above).

Now, you may argue that the infinity would be nonsensical if it's not a
subordinate job. Simplest approach would be likely to introduce the
special "inherit" value (such a literal name may be misleading as it
would be also "dont-care").

I've been bitten by this as well. However, the protection defaults to
off and I find it this matches the general rule that kernel provides the
mechanism and user(space) the policy.

(I acknowledge the current mechanism lacks an explicit way to express
the inherit/dont-care value.)

Other controllers mostly provide the limit or weight controls, I'd say
protection semantics is specific only to the memory controller so
far [2]. I don't think (at least by now) it can be aligned as the weight
or limit semantics.

I see how your reasoning works for limits (you set memory limit and you
need to control io/cpu too to maintain intended isolation). I'm confused
why having a scapegoat (or donor) sibling for protection should not be
supported or how it breaks protection for others if not combined with
io/cpu controllers. Feel free to point me to the message if I overlooked
it.

I think there is different perception on both sides because of unclear
definitions, so I seek to clarify that.

Sure, but I think it's better to (try reaching|reach) a consensus than
to introduce split behavior (maintenance, debugging).

Thanks,

[2] I admit I didn't look into io.latency that much and IIRC
    cpu.uclamp.{min,max} don't have the overcommit issue.
