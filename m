Subject: [PATCH v12 0/5] xenbus/backend: Add memory pressure handler callback

Granting pages consumes backend system memory.  In systems configured
with insufficient spare memory for those pages, it can cause a memory
pressure situation.  However, finding the optimal amount of the spare
memory is challenging for large systems having dynamic resource
utilization patterns.  Also, such a static configuration might lack
flexibility.

To mitigate such problems, this patchset adds a memory reclaim callback
to 'xenbus_driver' (patch 1) and then introduce a lock for race
condition avoidance (patch 2).  After that, patch 3 applies the callback
mechanism to mitigate the problem in 'xen-blkback'.  The fourth and
fifth patches are trivial cleanups; those fix nits we found during the
development of this patchset.

Note that patch 1, 4, and 5 are not changed since v9.
