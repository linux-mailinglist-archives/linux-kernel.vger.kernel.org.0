The 'now' argument is one thing but why not:

-int update_thermal_load_avg(u64 now, struct rq *rq, u64 capacity)
+int update_thermal_load_avg(u64 now, struct rq *rq)
 {
+       u64 capacity = arch_cpu_thermal_pressure(cpu_of(rq));
+
        if (___update_load_sum(now, &rq->avg_thermal,

This would make the call-sites __update_blocked_others() and
task_tick(_fair)() cleaner.

I guess the argument is not to pollute pelt.c. But it already contains
arch_scale_[freq|cpu]_capacity() for irq.
