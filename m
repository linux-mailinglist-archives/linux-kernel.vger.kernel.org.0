That's a bit misleading.

The timer pinned flag prevents the MOHZ timer placement heuristics to take
effect. That means that the timer is enqueued on the CPU on which the
enqueue function is invoked.

I'd rather say:

    That means that pinned timers are not guaranteed to stay on the
    initialy selected CPU. They move to the CPU on which the enqueue
    function is invoked via mod_timer() or add_timer().

    If the timer should be placed on a particular CPU then add_timer_on()
    has to be used.

Or something like that. Too tired to think about it right now, but you get
the idea.

Thanks,
