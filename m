Jaegeuk,

IIUC, as getting hint from commit 740432f83560, are we trying to fix potential
deadlock like this?

In low memory scenario:

- f2fs_write_checkpoint()
 - block_operations()
  - f2fs_sync_node_pages()
   step 1) flush cold nodes, allocate new bio from mempool
   - bio_alloc()
    - mempool_alloc()
   step 2) flush hot nodes, allocate a bio from mempool
   - bio_alloc()
    - mempool_alloc()
   step 3) flush warm nodes, be stuck in below call path
   - bio_alloc()
    - mempool_alloc()
     - loop to wait mempool element release, as we only
       reserved memory for two bio allocation, however above
       allocated two bios never getting submitted.

#define BIO_POOL_SIZE 2

If so, we need avoid using bioset, or introducing private bioset, at least
enlarging mempool size to three (adapt to total log headers' number)...

Thanks,
