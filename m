Good point. We actually keep a few things in the cma version of this,
and I think I copied that over when I started here, but never cleaned
it up.

Yea. There is some awkwardness, and some is due to using the helper
infrastructure, but some is just clutter and I'll revise that.

Done.

I'm not sure this is useful, as there are cases where there are
multiple heaps that use the same ops. Specifically the multiple CMA
heaps.

Andrew and I went back and forth on this a bit. It looks like he just
responded so I'll defer to his answer.

Fair. There is some cases where we use the priv data, but I'll try to
see if I can minimize it.  And again, I think having the dma_heap
structure be internal/private to the heap implementations made it
difficult to be a contained structure. So it goes back to the
export_info structure point above.

This one is due to the optional heap helpers infrastructure. If a heap
implements its own dma_buf_ops, it can have release directly call the
buffer free function. However, since we tried to minimize the code we
have the heap helpers infrastructure which implements a shared
dma_buf_op, we need some way for the helper release function to call
back to the heap specific free.  We could put it in the dma_heaps_ops
like you suggest, but that brings some confusion as well, as nothing
in the dma-heaps core would call it, it would only be a tool for the
helper infrastructure to trace back to the heap specific free call.
This is why its passed to the heap_helper initializer.  I agree it
feels a little odd, so I'd welcome alternate approaches.

Very much appreciate the review and feedback!  I'll try to address as
much of this as I can in the next revision.

thanks
