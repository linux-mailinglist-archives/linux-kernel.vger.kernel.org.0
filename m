I don't have a plan so far.  I'm still at the phase to only worry
about whether it can be at least merged in master.. :)

I would think it won't worth it to backport this to stables though,
considering that it could potentially change quite a bit for faulting
procedures, and after all the issues we're fixing shouldn't be common
to general users.

I think we don't need to worry on that - QEMU will prohibit ballooning
during postcopy starting from the first day.  Feel free to see QEMU
commit 371ff5a3f04cd7 ("Inhibit ballooning during postcopy").

I agree, I'm not sure how other people think on ABI stability, but...
for my own preference I don't worry much on ABI breakage for a problem
like this.
