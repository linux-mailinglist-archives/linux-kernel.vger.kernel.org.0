One advantage is that the next piece of quirky hw with a properly 
implemented IIDR does not require a new IORT model.

And today, this handling is only for hi1620, and since we can use hi1620 
IIDR to id it, then it seems good to remove code outside the PMCG driver 
specifically to handle it.

But if you think it's going to be needed again, then it makes sense not 
to remove it.

But won't there still be an SMMU associated with the AMBA DTI masters, 
in your example?

It's this SMMU which the PMCG driver would reference as the "parent" 
device, and the IORT parsing would need to do the lookup for this reference.

But then, this becomes something that the DT parsing would need to 
handle also.

JFYI, PMCG_CEIDn contents for hi1620 are all zero, apart from PMDEVARCH 
and PMDEVTYPE, which are same as arm implementation according to the 
spec - sigh...

For sure. The spec reads that the PMCGs may be "independently-designed", 
hence no general id method. I don't get this.

OK, so this is another reason why I thought that having a reference to 
the SMMU device could be useful in terms of solving that problem.
