In case we believe that OFFER -> RESCINF sequence is always ordered
by the host AND we don't care about other offers in the queue the
suggested locking is OK: we're guaranteed to process RESCIND after we
finished processing OFFER for the same channel. However, waiting for
'offer_in_progress == 0' looks fishy so I'd suggest we at least add a
comment explaining that the wait is only needed to serialize us with
possible OFFER for the same channel - and nothing else. I'd personally
still slightly prefer the algorythm I suggested as it guarantees we take
channel_mutex with offer_in_progress == 0 -- even if there are no issues
we can think of today (not strongly though).
