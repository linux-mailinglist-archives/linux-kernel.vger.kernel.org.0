Is'nt that what defconfig is supposed to be all about?

arch/arm64/configs/defconfig

Well, SYSFS, I cannot agree testing as the rationale in
Kconfig.platform. And, looking at [1], I see majority being mandatory
components for the SoC bootup. However, most of the "optional" drivers
go into arm64 as defconfig (preferably as a module?) and if you find a
rationale for recommending DEBUG_GPIO, you could propose that to the
community as well.

Now, Thinking about this, I'd even challenge the current list of configs as
being "select". I'd rather do an "imply"[2] - yes, you need this for the
default dtb to boot, however a carefully carved dtb could boot with
lesser driver set to get a smaller (and less functional) kernel.

I noticed that you were posting a v2, for future reference, please use
diffstat section to point to lore/patchworks link to point at v1 (I
did notice you mentioned you had an update, thanks - link will help
catch up on older discussions). This helps a later revision reviewer
like me to get context.

Tero, would you be able to help with a better rationale as to where the
boundaries are to be in your mind, rather than risk every single
peripheral driver getting into ARCH_K3?

As of right now, I'd rather we do not explode the current list out of
bounds. NAK unless we can find a better rationale.
