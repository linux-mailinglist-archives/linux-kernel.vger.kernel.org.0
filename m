I think you need it to set pdev->resource[], which is currently done
long before the driver claims the device (though one could imagine
delaying it even as far as pci_enable_device()-time).  I don't think
the translation is actually *used* until the driver claims the device
because only the driver knows how to do any inb/outb to the device.

But of course, that's all speculative and doesn't change what you need
to do now.  The current code assumes we know the translations during
enumeration, so you need to do the logic_pio registration before
enumerating.

Good question.  The ACPI host bridge driver (drivers/acpi/pci_root.c)
should support hotplug, but I'm not sure if there's a manual way to
trigger it via sysfs or something similar.  If there is, and you have
a machine with more than one host bridge, you might be able to remove
one that leads to non-essential devices.
