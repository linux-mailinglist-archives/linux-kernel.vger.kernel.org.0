Yes, but I can't simply split the patch. In order for each change to work on its
own, they'd have to be done differently than the final result.

I wouldn't mind at all if it was just a simple splitting, but you're asking
for too much work, this time, for no benefit that I can see.

I can reword the commit message if that helps, and skip the bullet list if it
is confusing. There's a single core issue and that is that the driver doesn't
update the pipe/channel configuration correctly leading to disabling of
arbitrary layers (not even those being updated - update of UI layer may disable
VI layer as a side effect for example) at wrong times. And only changes
necessary to debug/fix this are included.

I may try generating a nicer patch with a different diff options, if it makes it
more readable for review.

Because if I remove it I need to re-implement the functionality in the update
callback. The core will change what is called based on presence of callbacks.
It's not a simple removal.

If I first implement the new sun8i_[uv]i_layer_enable and update callback,
keeping a disable callback would not work, because the new update callback
will only work if disable callback is not defined (because it it is, then
the drm core will not call the update callback in all cases that I need).
