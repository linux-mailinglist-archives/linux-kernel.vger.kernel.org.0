Filling in a bunch more of the use-cases we have in drm. Don't need to
solve them all right away ofc, but whatever direction we're aiming for
should keep these in mind I think.

We use shmem to get at swappable pages. We generally just assume that
the gpu can get at those pages, but things fall apart in fun ways:
- some setups somehow inject bounce buffers. Some drivers just give
up, others try to allocate a pool of pages with dma_alloc_coherent.
- some devices are misdesigned and can't access as much as the cpu. We
allocate using GFP_DMA32 to fix that.

Also modern gpu apis pretty much assume you can malloc() and then use
that directly with the gpu.

Generally we cache mappings forever. Some exceptions for 32bit
userspace excluded, where people expect to be able to use more than
4GB of textures somehow, so we have to recycle old mappings. Obviously
applies less to gpus on socs.

Also, at least i915 also has writeback userspace mmaps, and userspace
doing the cflushing. Also not sure I ever mentioned this, but at least
i915 userspace controls the coherency mode of the device dma directly,
on a per-op granularity. For buffers shared with other processes it
defers to the gpu pagetables, which the kernel controls.

No idea personally, since we can ignore this on x86. I think atm
there's not a huge overlap of gpu drivers doing swapping and running
on something like arm where incompatible aliased mappings are bad.

Again, generally cached for as long as possible, until we run out of
space/memory somewhere.
