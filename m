Re-visit what exactly, and how?

My only concern really is whether it's safe for us to turn this off. It's
clear that somebody went to a lot of effort to add this extra goodness to
the IP, but your benchmarks suggest they never actually tried it out after
they finished building it.

Is there some downside I'm not seeing from disabling this stuff?

We probably also need some co-ordination with Andy if we're going to
merge this, since he maintains the firmware calling code.
