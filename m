Those were two different sentences.

We can't use the address of something on the stack, because we don't
know whether the stack is in vmalloc space or in the direct map.

We can't use the address of something we've allocated from the page
allocator, because the page allocator can't give us PUD-aligned memory.

Right.

I think it's wise to start a new mm.  I'm not sure exactly what calls
to make to get one going.

But what about hugetlbfs?  And vmalloc can also use larger pages these days.
I don't think these tests should be conditional on transparent hugepages.
