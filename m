It's not that simple - in neither direction (and no, I won't give guidelines
or reproduce the lame excuses and/or other reasons for creating "proprietary
Linux kernel drivers". They can very probably be found via $SEARCH_ENGINE
anyways).

The law term is "derived work" (you will probably find lots of
discussions if you $SEARCH_ENGINE it) and it's up to the module/driver
author to prove that the module/driver is not derived work from the
GPLed software it interoperates.
If you copy a skeleton driver (or cannibalise another driver) it's hard
to say it's not derived.

For the syscall layer, there exists POSIX, SUSv3 et.al. as well as lots
of more or more-the-like less identical implementations long before the
first line of .c of the Kernel.

One ugly and nasty thing about law is that it's not automatically
correct just because one (company or person) does/claims it. And it
doesn't make it right, legal, etc.
Not sueing that one also doesn't change a bit of the legal status.

Another even more ugly and nasty thing about a given law is that it's
bound to it's jurisdiction. Yes, some countries/goverments/
administrations want to extend it beyond their own and several can
actually do that but we are again in political swamp.
In short: Law people basically ignored the globalization as I see almost
no progress in the last decades in that area - just lame excuses and
propaganda-style discussions about the "law less internet" - there is
no "law less" area on the world as everywhere is at least one
jurisdiction.

It is neither technically nor law-wise relevant and/or interesting or a
point for or against anything if some powers-that-be plain simply ignore
laws. At most, it's a political thing ....

And every sane company which sees this should think about it and then
decide if they want to go there. I wouldn't do that (and hadn't do that
15 years ago).
Obviously a lot of them have no problem with these kind of "giving away
intellectual property, know-how and God knows what more". There are many
more stories about "what happens after moving $FACTORY to China" which
are off-topic here ....

For one that's IMHO the basic intention of the GPL (read and think about
"the four essential freedoms" on
https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html and their implications).
And one main reason is that the user of the driver withthe 4 freedoms is
capable of fixing errors in it - ask RMS about it;-)

And it's IMNSHO *not* the intention of China to produce an open, better
world - quite the contrary - so please don't try compare that or use that
in any discussion/analysis.

BTW it's IMHO a major difference between publishing documentation for
everyone just for creating interoperable software and forcing others to
release (all?) information and allow major influence for nation-controlled
bodies to company/project/organizations as such.

No, that's only an implementation model - even if it's published in a book.
The point is: It may change with any git-commit so it's a total different story
than syscalls et.al. (which are set in stone and it may produce "funny"
discussions if people want to bug-fix something there).

And you always have implicit skeleton (e.g. simple) drivers (think "/dev/null"
if you are looking for a minimalistic char driver) which people take as model
or even copy and edit them.
BTW if you copied a GPLv2 driver/skeleton/enough source code, you also copied
it's license too. Authors rights and copyright 101 .....

But it's not a *defined* interface in any technical interpretation. Do you
consider an interface which changes in every release (without backward
compatibility) a "defined interface"? I don't ....

At most it's a documented interface ...

If you want a *defined* driver interface, go to the Windows world as M$FT is
committed to maintain kernel-internal interfaces across major versions (yes,
they don't do it in 100% of all cases - just talk to Windows driver
maintainers which have to touch their driver with at least every version
...).

EXPORT has the same semantics from the (running) kernel to modules that
"extern" has in .c from one .o to another .o as you can't use the function
in a module without EXPORT - not more, not less.

I'm dead serious. I actually thought we talked about license/law stuff and
runtime situations which have no relevance when it comes to license/law issues.

And it solves the license issue. That's the price to pay, it's one possible
solution to your license problem, it's up to you where you find the - Your -
least cumbersome compromise ....

That's all completely irrelevant for license and law discussions.

So what's the main issue that you abuse ZFS for your agenda?

You feel limited by the GPLv2 (or any othre license)? Then don't use such
software. Problem solved.

Hell, there are people out there who will help only in GPL projects (and not
BSD and near-BSD as that's basically - and intentionally(!)- a "proprietary
license on call").

Everyone can integrate ZFS on their own and themselves in their product
without any license issue.

Market/customer choice is completely irrelevant for license and law
discussions.

Well, please search in the LKML archives - we have such discussions every
other year here and it won't (and can't) change the GPLv2 (or other versions)
as such.
And for a license change of the Linux kernel, you need the explicit agreement
from all contributors (at least for the more than trivial patches like "fixed
typo" etc. - that's another law discussion when my patch is not trivial enough
so that authors rights/copyright is actually applicable),

MfG,
	Bernd

PS: For all others: That's the end of the discussion from my side - I already
    wrote more than enough and I don't think can (or want) write anything not
    already written in this thread (by /me - of course;-).
