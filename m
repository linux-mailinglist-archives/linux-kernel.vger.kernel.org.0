I looked at this bug report, and it is very puzzling.

Yes, the value stored in *actual_buffer is written in
ld_usb_interrupt_in_callback(), but the value is simply
urb->actual_length and therefore does not need any validation.  The 
URB's transfer_buffer_length is taken from 
dev->interrupt_in_endpoint_size, which comes from usb_endpoint_maxp() 
and therefore cannot be larger than 2048.

(On the other hand, actual_buffer might not be aligned on a 32-bit 
address.  For x86, of course, this doesn't matter, but it can affect 
other architectures.)

Furthermore, the computation leading to the dev_warn() involves only
size_t types and therefore is carried out entirely using unsigned
arithmetic.  The warning's format string uses %zd instead of %zu;  
that's why the number showed up as negative but doesn't explain why it
looks so funny.

In fact, I don't see why any of the computations here should overflow
or wrap around, or even give rise to a negative value.  If syzbot had a
reproducer we could get more debugging output -- but it doesn't.
