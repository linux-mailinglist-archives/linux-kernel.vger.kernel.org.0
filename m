This generally looks good, but I have a few concerns below, mostly
related to concurrency.

IIUC we can drop MODULE_ALIGN back to PAGE_SIZE in this case, too.

Nit: I think it would be more consistent to call this
kasan_populate_vmalloc().

Nit: I think it would be preferable to use 'page' rather than 'backing',
and 'pte' rather than 'backing_pte', since there's no otehr namespace to
collide with here. Otherwise, using 'shadow' rather than 'backing' would
be consistent with the existing kasan code.

Does anything prevent two threads from racing to allocate the same
shadow page?

AFAICT it's possible for two threads to get down to the ptep, then both
see pte_none(*ptep)), then both try to allocate the same page.

I suspect we have to take init_mm::page_table_lock when plumbing this
in, similarly to __pte_alloc().

IIUC, this could leave the final portion of an allocated page
unpoisoned.

I think it might make more sense to poison each page when it's
allocated, then plumb it into the page tables, then unpoison the object.

That way, we can rely on any shadow allocated by another thread having
been initialized to KASAN_VMALLOC_INVALID, and only need mutual
exclusion when allocating the shadow, rather than when poisoning
objects.

Thanks,
Mark.
