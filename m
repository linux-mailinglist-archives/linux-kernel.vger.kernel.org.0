Agreed.

I think the 1) API seems a bit redundant IF we can expose the
single comamnd string interface.

If the implementation is enough generic, I think it is better to keep
"synth" for better usability.

For example, if the API is just generating a command string,
it would be easy to be reused by probe-events too.

struct dynevent_command {
  char *cmd_buf;
  enum dynevent_type type; /* Set by gen_*_cmd and checked on each API */
};

int gen_synth_cmd(struct dynevent_command *, const char *name, ...);
int add_synth_field(struct dynevent_command *, const char *type, const char *var);
int gen_kprobe_cmd(struct dynevent_command *, const char *name, const char *loc, ....);
int gen_kretprobe_cmd(struct dynevent_command *, const char *name, const char *loc, ....);
int add_probe_fields(struct dynevent_command *, const char *field, ...);
int create_dynevent(struct dynevent_command *);

struct dynevent_command cmd;

gen_synth_cmd(&cmd, "synthtest", "pid_t", "next_pid_field");
add_synth_field(&cmd, "char[16]", "next_comm_field");
...
create_dynevent(&cmd);

gen_kprobe_cmd(&cmd, "myprobe", "vfs_read+5", "%ax");
add_probe_fields(&cmd, "%bx", "%dx");
create_dynevent(&cmd);

gen_kretprobe_cmd(&cmd, "myretprobe", "vfs_write", "$retval");
create_dynevent(&cmd);

Actually, these are just wrappers of type verifier & strcat() :P
And it can provide similar user-experience and generic interface
with simplar implementation.

No need to move onto my series. Mine focuses on tracing
boot process, but your's are providing APIs for modules.

Yes, that is what I found.
