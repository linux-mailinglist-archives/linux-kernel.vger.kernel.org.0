No, I meant that the cost of reclaiming a unit of charges (e.g.
SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX) is not constant and depends on the state of the memory
on LRUs. Therefore any thread pool mechanism would lead to unfair
reclaim and non-deterministic behavior.

I can imagine a middle ground where the background reclaim would have to
be an opt-in feature and a dedicated kernel thread would be assigned to
the particular memcg (hierarchy).
