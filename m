I've found the addresses to be useful, especially if I had a way to dump the
stack data itself.  Wouldn't the register dump also be likely to give away the
addresses?

I don't see any debug setting for %pK (or %p) to always print the actual
address (closest is kptr_restrict=1 but that only works in certain
contexts)... from looking at the code it seems it hashes even if kaslr is
entirely disabled?  Or am I missing something?
