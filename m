We can layer another assumption on top of Tejun's assumptions from
commit 49f290903935 "ahci: update PCS programming". The kernel
community has not received any regression reports from that change
which says:

"
    port_map is determined from PORTS_IMPL PCI register which is
    implemented as write or write-once register.  If the register isn't
    programmed, ahci automatically generates it from number of ports,
    which is good enough for PCS programming.  ICH6/7M are probably the
    only ones where non-contiguous enable bits are necessary && PORTS_IMPL
    isn't programmed properly but they're proven to work reliably with 0xf
    anyway.
"

So the potential options I see are:

1/ Keep the current scheme, but limit it to cases where PORTS_IMPL is
less than 8 and assume this need to set the bits is unnecessary legacy
to carry forward

2/ Option1 + additionally use PORTS_IMPL as a gate to guess when the
PCS format might be different for values >= 8.

I think the driver does not need to consider Option2 unless / until it
encounters a platform where firmware does not "do the right thing",
and given Denverton has been in the wild with the wrong PCS twiddling
it seems to suggest nothing needs to be done there.

I'd be more comfortable with PORT_IMPL as the deciding factor.
