Yes. However i can't see a way to avoid that: its not possible to know
if the race described earlier happened or not. 

Do you have a suggestion on how to avoid this or a way to avoid
the IPI+raise softirq ?

Well, run_timer_softirq execute only if pending_map contains a bit set.

But the softirq will be raised, because pending_map will be set:

+               if (!bitmap_empty(base->pending_map, WHEEL_SIZE))
+                       goto raise;

No?
