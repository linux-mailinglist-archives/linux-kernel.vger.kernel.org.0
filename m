This patch series gives a particular behavior to PTRACE_SETREGS and
PTRACE_POKEUSER.  There should be a test case that validates that
behavior, including testing the weird cases where gs !=3D 0 and gsbase
contains unusual values.  Some existing tests might be pretty close to
doing what's needed.

Beyond that, the current putreg() code does this:

    case offsetof(struct user_regs_struct,gs_base):
        /*
         * Exactly the same here as the %fs handling above.
         */
        if (value >=3D TASK_SIZE_MAX)
            return -EIO;
        if (child->thread.gsbase !=3D value)
            return do_arch_prctl_64(child, ARCH_SET_GS, value);
        return 0;

and do_arch_prctl_64(), in turn, does this:

    case ARCH_SET_GS: {
        if (unlikely(arg2 >=3D TASK_SIZE_MAX))
            return -EPERM;

        preempt_disable();
        /*
         * ARCH_SET_GS has always overwritten the index
         * and the base. Zero is the most sensible value
         * to put in the index, and is the only value that
         * makes any sense if FSGSBASE is unavailable.
         */
        if (task =3D=3D current) {
         [not used for ptrace]
        } else {
            task->thread.gsindex =3D 0;
            x86_gsbase_write_task(task, arg2);
        }

        ...

So writing the value that was already there to gsbase via putreg()
does nothing, but writing a *different* value implicitly clears gs,
but writing a different value will clear gs.

This behavior is, AFAICT, complete nonsense.  It happens to work
because usually gdb writes the same value back, and, in any case, gs
comes *after* gsbase in user_regs_struct, so gs gets replaced anyway.
But I think that this behavior should be fixed up and probably tested.
Certainly the behavior should *not* be the same on a fsgsbase kernel,
and and the fsgsbase behavior definitely needs a selftest.
