... and the breakages introduced in -next are making it into mainline
without being fixed, as I just pointed out above. That by itself is bad.
It is much worse if the breakage is introduced on purpose.

The criteria for -next _used_ to be "ready for mainline". If breaking -next
on purpose is the new normal, no one should be surprised if it will be tested
even less than it is today.
