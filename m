Yes. Thus I put the tlb_flush always followed by tlb_sync to make sure
they always go in pairs.

I really didn't get this timeout warning log in previous kernel(Many
tlb_flush followed by one tlb_sync), But deferring the sync is not
suggested by our DE, thus I still would like to fix the sequence in this
patch with putting them together.

Thanks the confirm, I have sent a quick v2.
