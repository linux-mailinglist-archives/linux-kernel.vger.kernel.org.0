Yeah, leave it.

Ah, so going to sleep on wait_for_completion() is _much_ more expensive
than a short spin. So it all depends on the expected behaviour of the
IPI I suppose.

In general we expect these IPIs to be 'quick'.

Also, as is, you're allowed to use the smp_call_function*() family with
preemption disabled, which pretty much precludes using
wait_for_completion().
