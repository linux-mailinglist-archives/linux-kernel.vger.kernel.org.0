I am not sure how often this happens in practice (if at all), but
maybe this logic would work as well. In this case we would need to
mark DPB entries that are not used yet differently to avoid the issue
that this patch attempts to fix.

To give a precise example of the issue, for a stream that only uses 3
DPB entries at max, after an IDR frame the 4th DPB entry will
incorrectly be matched with the IDR frame of FieldOrderCount (0, 0)
and be the only active entry for this frame. Hantro is ok with it, but
this is not an optimal use of the DPB and MT8183 does not like that.

Maybe that could be enough indeed. Let me experiment with that a bit.
I believe this would work since in practice the result would be the
same as this patch, but for safety I'd rather have unused DPB entries
be unambiguously identified rather than letting the (0, 0) match do
the right thing by accident.

Passing the DPB directly I get corrupted frames on a regular basis
with MTK. I also confirmed that the firmware's expectations are what
this function does. Using the same function in the MTK driver, the
decoded stream is flawless.
