I wouldn't.  Please stop using that straw man.  I'm not saying version
checks are good, or useful for most things.  I am saying they are not.

Predefined compiler symbols to do version checking (of a feature) is
just a lesser instance of the same problem though.  (And it causes its
own more or less obvious problems as well).

I keep track of most things just fine...  But the release notes are part
of our web content, which is in a separate CVS repository (still nicer
than SVN :-) ), and since I don't use it very often it falls outside of
all my normal procedures.

That started as just

+       /* If this asm is asm inline, count anything as minimum size.  */
+       if (gimple_asm_inline_p (as_a <gasm *> (stmt)))
+         count = MIN (1, count);

(in estimate_num_insns) but then things ballooned.  Like such things do.
