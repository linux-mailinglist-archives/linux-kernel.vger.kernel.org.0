Btw, adding :rst: to kernel-abi markup at abi-obsolete.rst and 
abi-removed.rst produced just two warnings:

get_abi.pl rest --dir $srctree/Documentation/ABI/obsolete --rst-source:1689: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.
get_abi.pl rest --dir $srctree/Documentation/ABI/obsolete --rst-source:1692: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.

I'll fix those too at my repository.

I suspect, however, that Documentation/ABI/testing with its 353 files will
require a lot more care.

Thanks,
Mauro
