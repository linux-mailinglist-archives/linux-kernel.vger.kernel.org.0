The "BLOB" is not a piece of code. Its just a piece of data that gets
generated by our build tools. This data contains the
signed hash of the kernel, initrd, and kernel command line parameters.
Also it contains any information that the creator the the BLOB wants to
be made available to anyone needing it, inside the
secure-virtual-machine. All of this is integrity-protected and encrypted
to safegaurd it when at rest and at runtime.
 
Bottomline -- Blob is data, and hence no licensing implication. And due
to some reason, even data needs to have licensing statement, we can
make it available to have no conflicts with GPL.
