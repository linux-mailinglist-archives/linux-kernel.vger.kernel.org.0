Okay, then let's test real behavior.

I fired up my i5-8265U laptop with vanilla linux-next and passed mem=2G on the
command line. After boot up, I opened up chromium and played a video on YouTube.
Immediately after the video started, my laptop completely froze for a few
seconds; then, a few seconds later, my cursor began to respond again, but moving
it around was very laggy. The audio from the video playing was choppy during
this time. About 15-20 seconds after I had started the YouTube video, my system
finally stopped lagging.

Then I tried again with my patch applied (albeit a correct version that doesn't
use the refcount API). Upon starting the same YouTube video in chromium, my
laptop didn't freeze or stutter at all. The cursor was responsive and there was
no stuttering, or choppy audio.

I tested this multiple times with reproducible results each time.

I will attach a functional v2 of the patch that I used.
