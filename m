Yes, I already sent a new version of the patch, which changes the variable to an
int: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11203003/.  I was wondering more about
how to stop other people from running into this.

It's possible that's the better approach; someone would need to go through all
the xchg() users and check whether any truly need the 8 or 16-bit support.  My
main concern was just the annoyance of code that only fails to compile on
certain architectures.  It should either be one way or the other everywhere.
