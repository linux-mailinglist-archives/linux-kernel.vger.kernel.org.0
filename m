OK, I agree with you, I will improve it or just kill them all with
new iomap approach after it supports tail-end packing inline.

I agree with you. Thanks for your suggestion.

I don't have some benchmark for all of these, can I just set
REQ_PRIO for all metadata? is that reasonable?
Could you kindly give some suggestion on this?

OK, I will simplify it. Thanks for your suggestion.

Originally, mainly due to backport consideration since some
of our smartphones use 3.x kernel as well...

OK, I have to admit, that code was originally just copied from f2fs
with some modification (maybe it's not a good example for us).

Thanks,
