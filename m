That works for me. If you spin this as a real patch:

Tested-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

As I mentioned, initrd_start has not been initialized at all, so I
suspect we should also update its declaration in init/do_mounts_initrd.c
such that it is guaranteed to be initialized to zero. We get away with
that today, but that won't necessarily hold with LTO and so on...

Thanks,
Mark.
