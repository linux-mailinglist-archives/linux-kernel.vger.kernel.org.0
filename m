The model here is that Master device is PCI or Platform device and then
creates a bus instance which has soundwire slave devices.

So for any attribute on Master device (which has properties as well and
representation in sysfs), device specfic struct (PCI/platfrom doesn't
help). For slave that is not a problem as sdw_slave structure takes care
if that.

So, the solution was to create the psedo sdw_master device for the
representation and have device-specific structure.
