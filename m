The major Linux distributions maintain their own kernel configuration 
files, completely ignoring kernel defconfigs.  This has been so for a long 
time.

As you know, since you've worked on some of the distribution builder 
frameworks (not distributions) like OE and Buildroot, those build systems 
have sophisticated kernel configuration patching and override systems that 
can disable the debug options if the maintainers think it's a good idea to 
do that.

You've contributed to both Buildroot and OE meta-riscv RISC-V kernel 
configuration fragments yourself, so this shouldn't be a problem for you 
if you disagree with our choices here.  For example, here's an example of 
how to patch defconfig directives out in Buildroot:

  https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot/tree/board/qemu/csky/linux-ck807.config.fragment#n3

I'm assuming you don't need an example for meta-riscv, since you've 
already contributed RISC-V-related kernel configuration fragments to that 
repository.

I think it's false that only kernel developers know how to disable debug 
options in Kconfig files.  As far as the underlying premise that one 
shouldn't expect distribution maintainers to know how to change Kconfig 
options, we'll just have to agree to disagree.

OE doesn't have any RISC-V support upstream, so pure OE users won't notice 
any change at all.  Assuming you're talking about meta-riscv users: as 
noted above, it's simple to automatically remove Kconfig entries you 
disagree with, or add ones you want.

The best option for naive users who are seeking maximum performance is to 
use a vendor BSP.  This goes beyond settings in a kernel config file: it 
extends to compiler and linker optimization flags, LTO, accelerator 
firmware and libraries, non-upstreamed performance-related patches, 
vendor support, etc.

It's clear you strongly disagree with the decision to do this.  It's 
certainly your right to do so.  But it's not good to spread misinformation 
about how changing the defconfigs "slow[s] down all users," or 
exaggerating the difficulty for downstream software environments to back 
this change out if they wish.
