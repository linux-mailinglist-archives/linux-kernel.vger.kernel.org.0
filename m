That pretty much depends on the requirements we want to set on both the
ABI source files and the generated output. Obviously the requirements
can be conflicting; might be hard to produce fancy output if the input
is very limited.

At the bare minimum, you could convert the files to contain
reStructuredText field lists [1]. Add a colon at the start of the field
name, and make sure field bodies (values) are not empty.

Conversion of a file selected at random; I've only added ":" and "N/A".

Of course, you'd still need to add higher level files to include the ABI
files.

At the other end, you could add structure and syntax to your heart's
content, and make the output fancier too.

BR,
Jani.
