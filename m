To confirm: KCSAN will detect a race if it sets up a watchpoint on
ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER(var), and a concurrent write happens. Note
that the watchpoints aren't always set up, but only periodically
(discussed more below). For every watchpoint, we also inject an
artificial delay. Pseudo-code:

if watchpoint for access already set up {
  consume watchpoint;
else if should set up watchpoint {
  setup watchpoint;
  udelay(...);
  check watchpoint consumed;
  release watchpoint;
}

It is, and I would strongly discourage any such use, because it's not
necessary. See below.

Keep in mind that the time from ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER_BEGIN to END
might be on the order of a few nanosec, whereas KCSAN's default
watchpoint delay is 10s of microsec (default ~80 for tasks). That
means we would still have to set up a delay somewhere, and the few
nanosec between BEGIN and END are insignificant and don't buy us
anything.

Re feasibility: Right now setting up and removing watchpoints is not
exposed, and doing something like this would be an extremely intrusive
change. Because of that, without being able to quantify the actual
usefulness of this, and having evaluated better options (see below),
I'd recommend not pursuing this.

> Thoughts?

Firstly, what is your objective? From what I gather you want to
increase the probability of detecting a race with 'var'.

I agree, and have been thinking about it, but there are other options
that haven't been exhausted, before we go and make the interface more
complicated.

== Interface design ==
The interface as it is right now, is intuitive and using it is hard to
get wrong. Demanding begin/end markers introduces complexity that will
undoubtedly result in incorrect usage, because as soon as you somehow
forget to end the region, you'll get tons of false positives. This may
be due to control-flow that was missed etc. We had a similar problem
with seqlocks, and getting them to work correctly with KCSAN was
extremely difficult, because clear begin and end markers weren't
always given. I imagine introducing an interface like this will
ultimately result in similar problems, as much as we'd like to believe
this won't ever happen.

== Improving race detection for KCSAN_ACCESS_ASSERT access types ==
There are several options:

1. Always set up a watchpoint for assert-type accesses, and ignore
KCSAN_SKIP_WATCH/kcsan_skip counter (see 'should_watch()'). One
problem with this is that it would seriously impact overall
performance as soon as we get a few ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_*() in a hot path
somewhere. A compromise might be simply being more aggressive with
setting up watchpoints on assert-type accesses.

2. Let's say in the above example (without BEGIN/END) the total
duration (via udelay) of watchpoints for 'var' being set up is 4*D.
Why not just increase the watchpoint delay for assert-type accesses to
4*D? Then, just having one ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_WRITER(var) somewhere in
the region would have the same probability of catching a race.
(Assuming that the region's remaining execution time is on the order
of nanosecs.)

I have some limited evidence that (1) is going to help, but not (2).
This is based on experiments trying to reproduce racy use-after-free
bugs that KASAN found, but with KCSAN. The problem is that it does
slow-down overall system performance if in a hot path like an
allocator. Which led me to a 3rd option.

3. Do option (1) but do the opposite of (2), i.e. always set up a
watchpoint on assert-type accesses, but *reduce* the watchpoint delay.

I haven't yet sent a patch for any one of 1-3 because I'm hesitant
until we can actually show one of them would always be useful and
improve things. For now, the best thing is to dynamically adjust
udelay_{task,interrupt} and skip_watch either via Kconfig options or
/sys/modules/kcsan/parameters/ and not add more complexity without
good justification. A good stress test will also go a long way.

There are some more (probably bad) ideas I have, but the above are the
best options for now.

So, anything that somehow increases the total time that a watchpoint
is set up will increase the probability of detecting a race. However,
we're also trying to balance overall system performance, as poor
performance could equally affect race detection negatively (fewer
instructions executed, etc.). Right now any one of 1-3 might sound
like a decent idea, but I don't know what it will look like once we
have dozens of ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_*() in places, especially if a few of
them are in hot paths.

Thanks,
