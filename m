Yes, what Tetsuo says. Only syscall numbers and top-level arguments to
syscalls are easy to filter out. When indirect memory is passed to
kernel or (fd,ioctl) pairs are involved it boils down to solving the
halting problem.

There are some nice benefits of doing this in some form in kernel:
1. It makes reported crashes more trustworthy for kernel developers.
Currently you receive a crash and you don't know if it's a bug, or
working as intended (as turned out with serial console). It also
happened with syzkaller learning interesting ways to reach /dev/mem,
which was directly prohibited, but it managed to reach it via some
mounts and corrupted file names. Disabling the DEVMEM config in the
end reliably solved it once and for all.

2. It avoids duplication across test systems. Doing this in each test
system is again makes kernel testing hard and imposes duplication.
Tomorrow somebody runs new version of trinity, triforce, afl, perf
fuzzer and they hit the same issues, you get the same reports, and
have the same discussions and they slowly build the same list.

I like the idea of runtime knob that Andi proposed, and in fact this
looks quite similar to lockdown needs. And in fact it already have
LOCKDOWN_TIOCSSERIAL (does it does exactly the same as what we need?
if not, it may be something to improve in lockdown). It seems that any
fuzzing needs at least LOCKDOWN_INTEGRITY_MAX.

Could we incorporate some of the checks in this patch into lockdown?
FWIW we've just disabled sysrq entirely:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/dashboard/config/bits-syzbot.config#L182
because random packets over usb can trigger a panic sysrq (again
almost impossible to reliably filter these out on fuzzer side).

Not sure why lockdown prohibits parts of TIOCSSERIAL. Does it want to
prevent memory corruption, or also prevent turning off console output
(hiding traces)? If the latter then it may be reasonable to lockdown
lowering of console_loglevel.

But looks at some of the chunks here, it seems that we want something
slightly orthogonal to lockdown integrity/confidentiality, which
liveness/dos-prevention (can't accidentally bring down the whole
machine). E.g. FIFREEZE or bad SYSRQs.

There was some reason I did not enable lockdown when it was merged.
Now looking at the list again: LOCKDOWN_DEBUGFS is a no-go for us...
