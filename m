It is much easier to follow with some hints on code, so the true
requirement is that the OOM repear not block on GFP_FS and GFP_IO
allocations, great, that constraint is now clear.

This is all for driver debugging. The point of lockdep is to find all
these paths without have to hit them as actual races, using debug
kernels.

I don't think we need this kind of debugging on production kernels?

Well, I'm working to propose that we do the VA range test under core
mmu notifier code that cannot block and then we simply remove the idea
of blockable from drivers using this new 'range notifier'. 

I think this pretty much solves the concern?

You mean like this:

       CPU0                                 CPU1
                                        mutex_lock()
                                        kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)
                                        mutex_unlock()
  fs_reclaim_acquire()
  mutex_lock() <- illegal: lock dep assertion

?

lockdep handles this - that is what it does, it builds a graph of all
lock dependencies and requires the graph to be acyclic. So mutex_lock
depends on fs_reclaim_lock on CPU1 while on CPU0, fs_reclaim_lock
depends on mutex_lock. This is an ABBA locking cycle and lockdep will
reliably trigger.

So, if we wanted to do this, I'd probably suggest we retool
fs_reclaim's interface be more like

  prevent_gfp_flags(__GFP_IO | __GFP_FS);
  [..]
  restore_gfp_flags(__GFP_IO | __GFP_FS);

Which is lockdep based and follows the indirect lock dependencies you
talked about.

Then OOM and reclaim can specify the different flags they want
blocked.  We could probably use the same API with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM as I
was chatting with Tejun about:

https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rdma/msg77362.html

IMHO this stuff is *super complicated* for those of us outside the mm
subsystem, so having some really clear annotations like the above
would go a long way to help understand these special constraints.

I'm pretty sure there are lots of driver bugs related to using the
wrong GFP flags in the kernel.

My concern is that the requirement was very unclear. I'm trying to
understand all the bits of how these notifiers work and the exact
semantic of this OOM path have been vauge if it is really some GFP
flag restriction or truely related to not sleeping.
