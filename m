Getting killed by lmkd which is triggered by custom system memory allocation
parameters and hence not being able to swap out is a problem ? But is not the
problem created by lmkd itself.

Or Is the objective here is reduce the number of processes which get killed by
lmkd by triggering swapping for the unused memory (user hinted) sooner so that
they dont get picked by lmkd. Under utilization for zram hardware is a concern
here as well ?

Swapping out memory into zram wont increase the latency for a hot start ? Or
is it because as it will prevent a fresh cold start which anyway will be slower
than a slow hot start. Just being curious.
