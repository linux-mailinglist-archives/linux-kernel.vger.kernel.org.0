I tend to disregard the 80 col limit, so I might not be the best example
here :D

Right, I was implicitly suggesting that maybe we could forgo the
imbalance_adj computation and just roll with the imbalance_pct (with perhaps
and extra shift here and there). IMO the important thing here is the 
half-way cutoff.

I think that cutoff makes sense; it's also important that it isn't purely
busy CPU-based because we're not guaranteed to have 1 task per CPU (due to
affinity or else), so I think the "half as many tasks as available CPUs"
thing has some merit.
