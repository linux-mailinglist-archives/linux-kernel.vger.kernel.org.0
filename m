How so?  The wrapper, if one is needed, will need to have dedicated logic
for the vDSO no matter what interface is defined by the vDSO.  Taking the
leaf in %rcx instead of %rax would at worst add a single instruction.  At
best, it would eliminate the wrapper entirely by making the vDSO callable
from C, e.g. for enclaves+runtimes that treat EENTER/ERESUME as glorified
function calls, i.e. more or less follow the x86-64 ABI.

There are effectively four related, but independent, changes to consider:

  1. Make the RSP fixup in the "return from handler" path relative instead
     of absolute.

  2. Preserve RBX in the vDSO.

  3. Use %rcx instead of %rax to pass @leaf.

  4. Allow the untrusted runtime to pass a parameter directly to its exit
     handler.


For me, #1 is an easy "yes".  It's arguably a bug fix, and the cost is one
uop.

My vote for #2 and #3 would also be a strong "yes".  Although passing @leaf
in %rcx technically diverges from ENCLU, I actually think it will make it
easier to swap between the vDSO and a bare ENCLU.  E.g. have the prototype
for the vDSO be the prototype for the assembly wrapper:

typedef void (*enter_enclave_fn)(unsigned long rdi, unsigned long rsi,
				 unsigned long rdx, unsigned int leaf,
				 unsigned long r8,  unsigned long r9,
				 void *tcs,
				 struct sgx_enclave_exception *e,
				 sgx_enclave_exit_handler_t handler);

int run_enclave(...)
{
	enter_enclave_fn enter_enclave;

	if (vdso)
		enter_enclave = vdso;
	else
		enter_enclave = my_wrapper;
	return enter_enclave(...);
}


I don't have a strong opinion on #4.  It seems superfluous, but if the
parameter is buried at the end of the prototype then it can be completely
ignored by runtimes that don't utilize a handler.
