Boot time, and ease of development, and simplified system management.

Having M-mode linux as a supervisor/boot kernel can get us to responding
to HTTPS/SSH/etc requests within seconds of power-on, while the =
=E2=80=98boot=E2=80=99
kernel can be loading guest S-mode kernels from things like NVME flash
drives that are going to be a lot more code and development to support =
in
U-boot or any other non-linux dedicated boot loader.

There=E2=80=99s also a very strong security argument, as Linux is going =
to get the
largest and broadest security review, and will likely get software =
updates
a lot faster than dedicated boot firmwares will.

Another reason would be sharing the same kernel binary (elf file) for =
both
M-mode, and S-mode, and using the device tree passed to each to specify
which mode it should be running it. There are probably a bunch of =
gotchas
with this idea, and even so I suspect someone will decide to go ahead =
and
just do it eventually because it could make testing, validation, and =
security
updates a lot easier from an operational/deployment point of view.

Linuxbios convinced me that if you want to do a really large cluster,
you can build, manage, and run such a thing with fewer people and
engineering cost than if you have all these extra layers of boot =
firmware
that require some company to have firmware engineers and lots of extra
system testing on the firmware.=
