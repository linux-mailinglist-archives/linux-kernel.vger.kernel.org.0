With this one, my main concern is that this document looks *way* out of
date, to the point that I wonder whether it is still useful or not.  It
would be good to find somebody who knows about this stuff to figure that
out.  Consider:

That was a while ago at this point.

What are the chances that this list still works and has relevant people to
it?  It might be worth sending a copy of this patch there and seeing what
results...

Hmmm..where might I find such a distribution...? :)

I have nfs-utils 2.4.2 here.  So probably nobody needs to do this
installation at this point.

This directory, amusingly, has nothing after 1.0.7, so this advice is
actively wrong.

I could go on, but I think you get the point.  At a bare minimum we should
put a big warning at the top saying that this document is obsolete.  I
should create a standard warning, I guess; for now anything that gets the
point across should do.

Thanks,
