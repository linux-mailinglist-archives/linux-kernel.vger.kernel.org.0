But that's only after a isoc_missed occurred. What exactly does that mean?
Was the request transferred or not? My tests suggest that it was not
transferred, so I wanted to catch this before it happens.

The frame number is also updated for each "Transfer In Progress" interrupt.
If they match, then there a new request can still be queued successfully.
Without this I got unnecessary stop/start transfers in the middle of a
video frame. But maybe something else was wrong here. I'd need to recheck.

With this patch, the transfer is restarted for every video frame.
Otherwise, I just get a lot of isoc_missed and ignoring those did not help.
No valid data arrived after the first video frame.

Yes and it works in general. There are however some problems with that
approach that I want to avoid:

1. It adds extra overhead to handle the extra zero-length request.
Especially for encoded video the available bandwidth can be quite a bit
larger that what is actually used. I want to avoid that.

2. The UVC gadget currently does no know how many zero-length request must
added. So it needs fill all available request until a new video frame
arrives. With the current 4 requests that is not a problem right now. But
that does not scale for USB3 bandwidths. So one thing that I want to do is
to queue many requests but only enable the interrupt for a few of than.
From what I can tell from the code, the gadget framework and the dwc3
driver should already support this.
This will result in extra latency. There is probably an acceptable
trade-off with an acceptable interrupt load and latency. But I would like
to avoid that if possible.

Regards,
Michael
