So here's what I'm seeing: patchsets get sent and 0day bot finds an
issue almost each time. Which tells me, this patchset doesn't look ready.

I suggested you to do "make randconfig" builds to find those breakages
yourself but if you prefer 0day bot to do that, that's fine too.

My experience shows that almost always there's an aspect where both the
submitter and the maintainer haven't thought about and hurrying stuff
makes it worse. That's why I prefer stuff to be hammered out and tested
properly and *then* applied.

What in my reply made you feel you're being "yelled" at?

I have no clue what in my replies made you feel that. Please explain.
How should I have replied so that it doesn't come across negative?

5) Wait for 0day bot to chew on it too.

Yes, sounds ok.

Thx.
