Hi,

Our SoCs have a lot of glabal registers which is hard to be managed in
current syscon structure.

Same register's offset is different in different SoCs. We used chip
config macro to manage them which prevents driver from being compiled
in all-in-one image.

So I add syscons, syscon-names and an optional #vendor-cells property
as syscon consumer node's bindings. And implement coresponding helper
functions.

They have no side effect to current syscon consumer.

Thanks,
Orson

Changes in V2:

As per suggestion from Arnd:

* Remove #syscon-cells from syscon node.
* Add "#vendor-cells" into consumer node not affecting referred syscon
  itself.
* Change helper funcions parameter accordingly.
