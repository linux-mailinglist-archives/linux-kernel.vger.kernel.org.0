It doesn't... why is this important to check?

It is the exact same code twice though; IIRC this C language has a
feature to help with that.

What you're relying on is that ->rotate_necessary implies ->is_active
and there's pending events. And if we tighten ->rotate_necessary you can
remove the && ->nr_events.

It _IS_ a duplicate, it is the _exact_ same code twice. What you're
trying to say is that we need it in both places, but that's something
else entirely.
