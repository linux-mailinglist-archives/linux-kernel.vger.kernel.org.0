I thought turning all cc-options to y would work
for what you need.

With this, you can enable
CONFIG_MARCH_Z13=y and CONFIG_TUNE_Z14=y
instead of CONFIG_TUNE_DEFAULT.

If this approach does not work for you,
what is your requirement?

The macro definition in scripts/Kconfig.include
takes precedence over any environment variable.

So, if you want to hack it from the environment,
you need to change the code somehow.

The scripts/dummy-tools/ approach does not change
anything for the use-case in upstream.

The result is the same, of course.
