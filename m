Upgrading to 5.2 (from 5.1.y) on a "Dell XPS 13 9350" (is that a skylake too?)
showed similar symptoms. There's no pattern to the freezes that I can see.
They're rather frequent too (think every few minutes). Eg, two freezes while
composing this message!

My totally silly workaround is suspending (via Fn + Insert) and resuming.

Did you manage to narrow this any further?

Thanks,


Paul Bolle
