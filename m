Changing configurations amounts to much the same as disconnecting,
because both operations destroy all the existing interfaces.

Disconnect can arise in two different ways.

	Physical hot-unplug: All I/O operations will fail.

	Rmmod or unbind: I/O operations will succeed.

The second case is probably okay.  The first we can do nothing about.  
However, in either case we do need to make sure that memory allocations
do not require any writebacks.  This suggests that we need to call
memalloc_noio_save() from within usb_unbind_interface().
