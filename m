Not quite.
As outlined above, the non-existence of the vpd sysfs attribute doesn't
automatically imply that the device doesn't support VPD pages; we might
as well running on older kernels simply not supporting VPD pages in sysfs.
The whole idea of the wwid is that the attribute is _always_ present, so
we don't have to out-guess the kernel here; if the kernel supports the
wwid attribute it will be present, full stop.

(Background: we do was to avoid doing I/O from uevents, as the events
are handled asynchronously, so by the time the event is handled the
device might not be accesible anymore, leading to a stuck udev process.)

Cheers,

Hannes
