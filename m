I know exactly how much effect innocuous changes can have...

Sorting out process migration on a 1024 cpu NUMA system must be a PITA.

For this case an idle cpu doing a unlocked check for a processes that has
been waiting 'ages' to preempt the running process may not be too
expensive.
I presume the locks are in place for the migrate itself.
The only downside is that the process's data is likely to be in the wrong cache,
but unless the original cpu becomes available just after the migrate it is
probably still a win.
