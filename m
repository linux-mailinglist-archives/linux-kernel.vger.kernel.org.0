The patch

   regmap: fix bulk writes on paged registers

has been applied to the regmap tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regmap.git for-5.2

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] regmap: fix bulk writes on paged registers

On buses like SlimBus and SoundWire which does not support
gather_writes yet in regmap, A bulk write on paged register
would be silently ignored after programming page.
This is because local variable 'ret' value in regmap_raw_write_impl()
gets reset to 0 once page register is written successfully and the
code below checks for 'ret' value to be -ENOTSUPP before linearising
the write buffer to send to bus->write().

Fix this by resetting the 'ret' value to -ENOTSUPP in cases where
gather_writes() is not supported or single register write is
not possible.
