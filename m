The NVMe endpoint function driver currently creates the admin ACQ and
ASQ on startup. When the NVMe host connects over PCIe, NVMe endpoint
function driver handles the Create/Delete SQ/CQ commands and any other
commands that cannot go to the NVMe target on behalf of the host. For
example, it creates a pair of I/O CQ and SQ as requested by the Linux
host kernel nvme.ko driver. The NVMe endpoint function driver supports
Controller Memory Buffer (CMB). The I/O SQ is therefore located in CMB
as requested by host nvme.ko.

As for n:1 relationship between SQs and CQs, I have not implemented that
yet since I didn't get such a request from the host nvme.ko yet. I agree. It
needs to be implemented at some point. It is doable. I appreciate your
comment and took note of it.

The code is still work in progress. It is not stable yet for reliable use or
upstream patch submission. It is stable enough for me to see it work from
my Debian host desktop to capture screenshots of NVMe partition
benchmarking, formatting, mounting, file storage and retrieval activity
such as I mentioned. I could look into possibly submitting an RFC patch
upstream for early review and feedback to improve it but it is not in a
polished state yet.

Thanks for this suggestion. I will try using devm_memremap_pages() to
create a page backing. I will also look for Logan's work regarding
ZONE_DEVICE pages.

Feedback on this is clear. Page struct backing is required to use
scatterlists. Thanks.
