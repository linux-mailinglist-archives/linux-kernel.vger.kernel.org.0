I am not exibiting "pure"-cissexism because I wholly support men who 
wish to marry young girls. "Paedophillia" is not "pure-cissexism". It' 
might be "misogyny", since women constantly use their white pitbulls to 
attack however.

You editing my words was no authorized by me. Short quotes are fine and 
fair-use, but editing the work for anything other than spelling is not. 
I did not call the man a [she] I called him a he. A he that CHOPPED OFF 
HIS GENITALS.

Any "difficulty" he is going through is of his own making. It is 
perverse to tell me about it.

That is who "represents" the Free Software movement now: you toss out 
the guy who you _think_ __maybe__ likes young girls for his 3 text posts 
on his own website, and you uphold the guy who pays people to cut off 
his penis and slice away his testicals and take pictures of it.

Which is fairly similar to what he does to core boot: so I think maybe 
that sorta gave him the idea. Also the fact that he never put the 
weights up probably exacerbated the problem (weight training excercize 
increases testosterone: which is why I'm so productive in programming my 
Free Software game)

Libre boot is known as "tranny boot" and the FSF is known as "a buch of 
do-nothing trannys and gays plus one straight old MIT hacker who they 
just threw out because he didn't fit in with the society there"

You drive the actual programmers away, in order to get some women and 
queers. You let the bird in the hand go, thinking you will get those in 
the bush.
