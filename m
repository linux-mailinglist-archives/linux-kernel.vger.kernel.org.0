Subject: [PATCH v10 00/22] Generic page walk and ptdump
Date:   Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:45:41 +0100

This is a slight reworking and extension of my previous patch set
(Convert x86 & arm64 to use generic page walk), but I've continued the
version numbering as most of the changes are the same. In particular
this series ends with a generic PTDUMP implemention for arm64 and x86.

Many architectures current have a debugfs file for dumping the kernel
page tables. Currently each architecture has to implement custom
functions for this because the details of walking the page tables used
by the kernel are different between architectures.

This series extends the capabilities of walk_page_range() so that it can
deal with the page tables of the kernel (which have no VMAs and can
contain larger huge pages than exist for user space). A generic PTDUMP
implementation is the implemented making use of the new functionality of
walk_page_range() and finally arm64 and x86 are switch to using it,
removing the custom table walkers.

To enable a generic page table walker to walk the unusual mappings of
the kernel we need to implement a set of functions which let us know
when the walker has reached the leaf entry. After a suggestion from Will
Deacon I've chosen the name p?d_leaf() as this (hopefully) describes
the purpose (and is a new name so has no historic baggage). Some
architectures have p?d_large macros but this is easily confused with
"large pages".

Mostly this is a clean up and there should be very little functional
change. The exceptions are:

* x86 PTDUMP debugfs output no longer display pages which aren't
  present (patch 14).

* arm64 has the ability to efficiently process KASAN pages (which
  previously only x86 implemented). This means that the combination of
  KASAN and DEBUG_WX is now useable.

Also available as a git tree:
git://linux-arm.org/linux-sp.git walk_page_range/v10

Changes since v9:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190722154210.42799-1-steven.price@arm.com/
 * Moved generic macros to first page in the series and explained the
   macro naming in the commit message.
 * mips: Moved macros to pgtable.h as they are now valid for both 32 and 64
   bit
 * x86: Dropped patch which changed the debugfs output for x86, instead
   we have...
 * new patch adding 'depth' parameter to pte_hole. This is used to
   provide the necessary information to output lines for 'holes' in the
   debugfs files
 * new patch changing arm64 debugfs output to include holes to match x86
 * generic ptdump KASAN handling has been simplified and now works with
   CONFIG_DEBUG_VIRTUAL.

Changes since v8:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190403141627.11664-1-steven.price@arm.com/
 * Rename from p?d_large() to p?d_leaf()
 * Dropped patches migrating arm64/x86 custom walkers to
   walk_page_range() in favour of adding a generic PTDUMP implementation
   and migrating arm64/x86 to that instead.
 * Rebased to v5.3-rc1
