Okay. The GUP functions are not properly documented for my taste. There
is no indication whether or not the mm_sem has to be acquired prior
invoking it. Following the call chain of get_user_pages() I ended up in
__get_user_pages_locked() `locked = NULL' indicated that mm_sem is no
acquired and then I saw this:
|                 if (!locked)
|                         /* VM_FAULT_RETRY couldn't trigger, bypass */
|                         return ret;

kind of suggesting that it is okay to invoke it without holding the
mm_sem prefault. It passed a few tests and then
	https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1556657902.6132.13.camel@lca.pw

happened. After that, I switched to the locked variant and the problem
disappeared (also I noticed that MPX code is invoked within ->mmap()).

I need to poke at that. I has been removed but then KVM folks complained
that they kind of depend on that if it has been exposed to the guest. We
need to fade it out slowly…

oki.

yes, because size >= fpu_user_xstate_size

no, we first check the range and then write. It is later checked again
after the size has been extended.
