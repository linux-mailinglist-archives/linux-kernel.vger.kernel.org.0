Well, I definitely don't want to tie it to "I turned off kaslr in
order to help debugging". That just means that now you're debugging a
kernel that is fundamentally different from what people are running.

So I'd much rather have people just set a really magic flag, perhaps
when kgdb is in use or something.

Please just use '%pS'.

The symbol and offset is what is useful when users send crash-dumps.
The hex value is entirely pointless with kaslr - which should
basically be the default.

Note that this isn't about security at that point - crash dumps are
something that shouldn't happen, but if they do happen, we want the
pointers. But the random hex value just isn't _useful_, so it's just
making things less legible.
