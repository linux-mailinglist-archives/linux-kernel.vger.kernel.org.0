I did, I ignored it because it wasn't 99 or something silly like that,
but I'd definitely mop it up when doing the proposed.

Mostly Android I suspect, but if SoC specific drivers have RT threads,
it's their responsibility to integrate properly with the rest of Android
of course.

So the push-pull balancer we have (designed for FIFO but also applied to
RR) will only move a task if the destination CPU has a lower prio.  In
the case where one CPU has 3 tasks and the other 1, and they're all the
same prio, it does nothing.  For FIFO that is fine, for RR, not so much.

Because then the one CPU will RR between 3 tasks, giving each task
1/3rd, while the other will only run the one task.
