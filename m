I disagree. If you advertise split-lock detection with the current core capa=
bility bit, it should *work*.  And it won=E2=80=99t.  The choices you=E2=80=99=
re actually giving the guest are:

a) Guest understands SLD and wants it on.  The guest gets the same behavior a=
s in bare metal.

b) Guest does not understand. Guest gets killed if it screws up as described=
 below.

n host is SLD-fatal, and let guest survive when SLD-WARN for old sane buggy g=
uest.

All true, but the result of running a Linux guest in SLD-warn mode will be b=
roken.

I think you should think the details all the way through, and I think you=E2=
=80=99re likely to determine that the Intel architecture team needs to do *s=
omething* to clean up this mess.

There are two independent problems here.  First, SLD *can=E2=80=99t* be virt=
ualized sanely because it=E2=80=99s per-core not per-thread. Second, most us=
ers *won=E2=80=99t want* to virtualize it correctly even if they could: if a=
 guest is allowed to do split locks, it can DoS the system.

So I think there should be an architectural way to tell a guest that SLD is o=
n whether it likes it or not. And the guest, if booted with sld=3Dwarn, can p=
rint a message saying =E2=80=9Chaha, actually SLD is fatal=E2=80=9D and carr=
y on.

>> ISTM, on an SLD-fatal host with an SLD-aware guest, the host should tell t=

=E2=80=9D and the guest should somehow acknowledge it so that it sees the ar=
chitectural behavior instead of something we made up.  Hence my suggestion.
