You're wrong.

Islam explicitly allows men to marry female children.
Bukari Hadith book 5
Sahih Bukhari 5:58:236
Sahih Bukhari 7:62:64
Sahih Bukhari 8:73:151

The 5th book of the Torah, the last law book, Devarim, EXPLICITLY 
commands child marraige, including in cases of rape (tahpas): Devarim 
chapter 22, verse 28. Relevant words:
Hebrew masoretic text: Na'ar (child) (>Nachmanides points out that a 
child may be called na'ar from the moment he is born. )
Greek septuagint: Padia (child, padia+philos = paedophillia)
Latin vulgate: Puella (young girl)

The Vedic traditions have laws that state that if a father fails to 
marry his girl off by 9 or 12 he goes to a hell.


This shows that you do not know what you think you know, you just spout 
the Americanisms you were told, without reading the original texts in 
their own languages.

Christianity is simply a heretical pro-woman, anti-male religion run by 
Americans.

The Sunni Islamics will destroy the American religion eventually, no 
matter what that requires, and we will marry cute young girls again, 
nomatter what is required to effect that change. That freedom.
