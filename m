You're right. This example is for the allocation request with
gfp_zone(gfp_mask),
MOVABLE_ZONE.

I'm okay with your change but I try again to be better. Please check the
following rewritten commit message and please let me know if it is better
than before.

Thanks.

Subject: [PATCH] mm/page_alloc: use ac->high_zoneidx for classzone_idx

Currently, we use classzone_idx to calculate lowmem reserve proetection
for an allocation request. This classzone_idx causes a problem
on NUMA systems when the lowmem reserve protection exists for some zones
on a node that do not exist on other nodes.

Before further explanation, I should first clarify how to compute
the classzone_idx and the high_zoneidx.

- ac->high_zoneidx is computed via the arcane gfp_zone(gfp_mask) and
represents the index of the highest zone the allocation can use
- classzone_idx was supposed to be the index of the highest zone on
the local node that the allocation can use, that is actually available
in the system

Think about following example. Node 0 has 4 populated zone,
DMA/DMA32/NORMAL/MOVABLE. Node 1 has 1 populated zone, NORMAL. Some zones,
such as MOVABLE, doesn't exist on node 1 and this makes following
difference.

Assume that there is an allocation request whose gfp_zone(gfp_mask) is
the zone, MOVABLE. Then, it's high_zoneidx is 3. If this allocation is
initiated on node 0, it's classzone_idx is 3 since actually
available/usable zone on local (node 0) is MOVABLE. If this allocation
is initiated on node 1, it's classzone_idx is 2 since actually
available/usable zone on local (node 1) is NORMAL.

You can see that classzone_idx of the allocation request are different
according to their starting node, even if their high_zoneidx is the same.

Think more about these two allocation requests. If they are processed
on local, there is no problem. However, if allocation is initiated
on node 1 are processed on remote, in this example, at the NORMAL zone
on node 0, due to memory shortage, problem occurs. Their different
classzone_idx leads to different lowmem reserve and then different
min watermark. See the following example.

- static min watermark for the NORMAL zone on node 0 is 750.
- lowmem reserve for the request with classzone idx 3 at the NORMAL
on node 0 is 4096.
- lowmem reserve for the request with classzone idx 2 at the NORMAL
on node 0 is 0.

So, overall min watermark is:
allocation initiated on node 0 (classzone_idx 3): 750 + 4096 =3D 4846
allocation initiated on node 1 (classzone_idx 2): 750 + 0 =3D 750

allocation initiated on node 1 will have some precedence than allocation
initiated on node 0 because min watermark of the former allocation is
lower than the other. So, allocation initiated on node 1 could succeed
on node 0 when allocation initiated on node 0 could not, and, this could
cause too many numa_miss allocation. Then, performance could be
downgraded.

Recently, there was a regression report about this problem on CMA patches
since CMA memory are placed in ZONE_MOVABLE by those patches. I checked
that problem is disappeared with this fix that uses high_zoneidx
for classzone_idx.

http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180102063528.GG30397@yexl-desktop

Using high_zoneidx for classzone_idx is more consistent way than previous
approach because system's memory layout doesn't affect anything to it.
With this patch, both classzone_idx on above example will be 3 so will
have the same min watermark.

allocation initiated on node 0: 750 + 4096 =3D 4846
allocation initiated on node 1: 750 + 4096 =3D 4846

One could wonder if there is a side effect that allocation initiated on
node 1 will use higher bar when allocation is handled on local since
classzone_idx could be higher than before. It will not happen because
the zone without managed page doesn't contributes lowmem_reserve at all.
