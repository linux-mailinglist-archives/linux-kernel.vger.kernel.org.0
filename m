Are physical package descriptions really needed? What does "socket" 
imply that a higher layer "cluster" node grouping does not? It doesn't 
imply a different NUMA distance and the definition of "socket" is 
already not well defined, is a dual chiplet processor not just a fancy 
dual "socket" or are dual "sockets" on a server board "slotket" card, 
will we need new names for those too..
