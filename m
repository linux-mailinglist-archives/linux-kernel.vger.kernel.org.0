Ok now I understand what you meant. Actually vram_stolen_size is
always page aligned so fb_size doesn't need any page alignment here.
There is also no need to align for psbfb_create() since it also takes
care of this.

What I would prefer is to have a single place where the alignment is
made so any hardware requirements would be transparent to the rest of
the code.

Best would be if alignment is only made in psb_gtt_alloc_range() and
then store the actual size in struct gtt_range. That way we can just
pass along that value to memset() and drm_gem_object_init() without
caring about how it is adjusted.

This is a remnant from trying to add support for 2D and/or overlay
planes (don't really remember). Doesn't matter if it stays or goes
away.

I suppose most of this is outside the scope of what you're trying to
do so we can just leave it as is and I can clean it up later.

Yes, this also works correctly for me.

It's not panning at all for me. I never really found gtt rolling to be
useful. It's a neat trick but I didn't have a problem with console
scrolling speed to begin with. I might just remove it.

Did you try this on CDV? There's only 2D acceleration on Poulsbo and Oaktrail.

Focus on your requirements and I'll look at the rest.
