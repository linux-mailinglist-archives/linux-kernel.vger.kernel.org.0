Right, it's not about "being clever", it's about not adding opt-in code 
to the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of drivers which *might* ever 
find themselves used on a system where they would need the IOMMU's help 
for DMA.

Wouldn't help much. That particular issue is nothing to do with DMA ops 
really, it's about IOMMU initialisation. On something like SMMUv3 there 
is literally no way to turn the thing on without blocking unknown 
traffic - it *has* to have stream table entries programmed before it can 
even allow stuff to bypass.

The answer is either to either pay attention to the "Quiesce all DMA 
capable devices" part of the boot protocol (which has been there since 
pretty much forever), or to come up with some robust way of 
communicating "live" boot-time mappings to IOMMU drivers so that they 
can program themselves appropriately during probe.
