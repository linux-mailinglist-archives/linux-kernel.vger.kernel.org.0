Oh, and I forgot; the other thing I had to do to get s2idle's power
consumption down to suspend-2-ram was to unload the SD card reader;
apparently that device driver didn't know how to do the low power
saving thing under OS control.  So I ultimately was able to get the
power while suspended of s2idle down to that of s2ram.  What I wasn't
able to solve for my laptop was the reliability of resuming after the
suspend....
