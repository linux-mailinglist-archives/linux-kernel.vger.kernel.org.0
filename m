I have a couple old macs with IDE. I have a PowerBook 190 and a
Performa (a 636? - it's buried away so I'm not 100% sure) both with
IDE drives. I'll try to find time to pull one of them out and see if
they still run. Can Linux run on a system with a 68LC040 these days?
I know there were issues with FPU emulation at various points. Both
of those would lack FPU due to using a 68LC040 chip.

The 3400c is PCI based and so probably isn't at all compatible. It
should be using the same driver as the other PCI models. There is
already a PATA_MACIO configuration option for that style. The 5300
is the one that's basically an upgraded 68k model (it's nearly
identical to the 190 internally).
