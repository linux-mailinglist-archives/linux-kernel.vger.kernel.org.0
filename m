Yes, and that's fine.

No, it's only not allowed if you you attached to a tracepoint that can
be called without rcu watching. That's up to the caller to figure it
out. Tracepoints were never meant to be a generic thing people should
use without knowing what they are really doing.

Then they need to know what they are doing.

We can just say, "If you plan on using RCU, be aware that it man not be
watching and you get do deal with the fallout. Use rcu_is_watching() to
figure it out."

No, look what the patch did for perf. Why make *all* callbacks suffer
if only some use RCU? If you use RCU from a callback, then you need to
figure it out. The same goes for attaching to the function tracer.
