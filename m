Thanks for noticing :) One trick that might help with remembering my
name is that every other letter is an "a" :)

Yeah, because this patch wasn't central to the functionality. At worse
case, I drop the patch and modules would still work. While waiting for
responses for the other emails -- I was working on measuring the speed
up.

If I just took the clock bindings (in a final solution we'll have to
look up clocks, resets, regulators, interrupts, etc) in a SDM845 and
made them into device links, that resulted in ~500+ searches for
devices by their nodes.

Looking at all 500+ of the lookups:

Total time:
With patch, : 2 milliseconds
Without patch: 12 milliseconds

Worst case single look up:
With patch: 39 microseconds
Without patch: 250 microseconds

Median of lookup times:
With patch: 208 nanoseconds
Without patch: 23 microseconds

Even if I assume there are 1000 device nodes, the increase in memory
from one additional pointer this patch adds is ~8KB.
2GB is the low ball on the amount of memory available in a typical
SDM845 device.
Boot time to userspace on the device Iooked at is: 1149 ms
So total boot time reduction is 0.8%
Total memory increase is 0.00038%

Once more device links are added I expect the boot time impact to be
larger. I think a 1% reduction in boot time for 0.00038% increase in
memory usage is a good trade off.

That 1% faster boot time can also be approximated to 1% reduction in
boot up power usage. That scaled to a million or billion devices
that'll run an Android or some form of ARM Linux kernel is still a
good chunk of energy savings for a small memory increase.

I still stand by the usefulness of this patch, but this is not the
hill I'm going to die on (so if dropping this patch is what it takes
to get modules working, I'll drop it for now).
