Maybe keep the infinity_io_desc as an out-of-tree patch then? You can
simply do both, and ioremap() will return the hardcoded address.

I would not expect a missing spinlock to have an observable effect, the
question is more whether it's correct in all rare corner cases where
the barrier is interrupted and the interrupt handler uses another barrier.

I think it is, but I would recommend adding a comment to explain this if
you drop the spinlock. (or a comment about why this works with fiq if you
keep the lock).
