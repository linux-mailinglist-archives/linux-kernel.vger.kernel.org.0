Both, For the current QEMU, we don't have the correct cpu topology
passed to linux. Luckily drjones planed to deal with the issue.

It depends on the hardware, on my platform, 16 cores per cluster.

From your example, the core 7 and core 8 has got different LLC but the same Low
Level cache?
From schedule view of point, lower level sched domain should be a subset of higher
Level sched domain.

My idea:
(1) If the dtb/acpi is not legal, the linux kernel should check or prompt to help debug.
(2)From scheduler view of point, low level sched domain should be a subset of high level
Sched domain.

I am very sure about (2), any example to show me (2) is wrong?

Thanks.
