As is today, SELinux policies would require enclave loaders to have
FILE__WRITE and FILE__EXECUTE permissions on /dev/sgx/enclave.  Presumably
other LSMs have similar requirements.  Requiring all processes to have
FILE__{WRITE,EXECUTE} permissions means the permissions don't add much
value, e.g. they can't be used to distinguish between an enclave that is
being loaded from an unmodified file and an enclave that is being
generated on the fly, e.g. Graphene.

Looking back at Andy's mail, he was talking about requiring FILE__EXECUTE
to run an enclave, so perhaps it's only FILE__WRITE that we're trying to
special case.

Three options I can think of, in descending order of magic required:

  1. Do nothing.  Userspace would essentially be required to mmap() the
     enclave after EINIT, which is ugly but not breaking since userspace
     could mmap() the enclave with a placeholder VMA prior to building
     the enclave, and then a series of mmap() to establish its "real"
     mapping.

  2. Propagate the permissions from EADD to the VMAs of the current mm
     if the entire EADD range is mapped and the mapping is PROT_NONE.

  3. Propagate the permissions from EADD to the VMAs of all mm structs
     that have mapped some piece of the enclave, following the matching
     rules from #2.

This would be called from sgx_mmap(), i.e. mmap().  Sorry that wasn't at
all clear.  The idea is to inherit the protections from the enclave pages
if mmap() was passed PROT_NONE, but do so in a paranoid way.

I don't think multi-process contraints would be required.  This would
allow an individual process to inherit the pre-verified protections.
Other process(es) could map the enclave page with different protections,
but doing so would require the appropriate FILE__* permissions for the
other process(es).
