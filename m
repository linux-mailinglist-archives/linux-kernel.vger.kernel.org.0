Hi Greg,

Actually we think it should be safer that making the device invisble than
just unbinding its driver. Looks like user can try to rebind it at any
time and we don't have any method to stop them.

Actually we followed the same method as vfio. The major purpose should be
extendibility, as we really need this to be sth long term maintainable.
It really helps, if we add some new members for extentions/enhancement
under the same ioctl. I don't think everybody needs this, but my
consideration here is if newer generations of hardware/specs come with some
extentions, I still hope we can resue these IOCTLs as much as we could,
instead of creating more new ones.

Thanks
