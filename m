This is basically just saying that the paging is done in the bulk I/O
code only (partly for performance, partly since we may need to page in
the middle of a bulk operation), not in the per-register I/O paths.

The plain read and write operations sit at the bottom of a stack that
(especially in the write path) deals with byte streams rather than
parsed data, they're only differentiated for read since there's a mix of
read and write I/O in a read operation.  Since for MMIO the register is
never part of a byte stream you'd need to contort things to parse the
address back out of the byte stream which is not great for abstraction
and likely to lead to bugs as different parts of the stack get confused
about what is handling endinaness and register size issues.

That doesn't really answer the question - what such an implementation
would look like?

For the reasons outlined above that's an abstraction problem.  This is
not something that should be being done in the physical I/O code, that's
not the right layer of abstraction.  Like I say push it up into the
core.
