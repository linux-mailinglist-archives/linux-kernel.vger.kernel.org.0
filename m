I guess that's tegra210-p2371-2180.dts because none of the others have
2 SD hosts enabled. I don't see anything obvious though. Are you doing
any runtime mods to the DT?

Can you try just removing the cache lookup at the beginning? Pretty
sure that will work as that's pretty much what we had before any
cache. Next try dumping out the phandle values and node ptr values.
