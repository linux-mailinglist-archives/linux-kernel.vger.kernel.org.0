I do think this is very much something we want to make possible. They
might pick a silly modifier (compression modifiers only compress bw, by
necessity the lossless ones have to increase storage space so kinda dumb
thing to push over the network if you don't add .xz or whatever on top).

I'm also hoping that intel's modifiers are definitely the one and only
that we ever screwed up, and we should be getting those fixed in the near
future too.

So maybe what we should do instead is add a comment to the modifier docs
that this stuff _is_ supposed to be transferrable over networks and work.
