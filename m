In case it helps, I made it through 2379 more reboots on my peach_pi
w/ no hangs.  I'm putting the device back in mothball now.  :-P  I
didn't go back and try to reproduce the original problems so I guess I
can't assert with 100% authority that the original issue is gone, but
my testing combined with Enric's seems like things are working fine.
