Yeah, I am aware of that. We do rely on more processes to map the page
which I've tried to explain in the changelog.

Btw. can we promote PageReferenced pages with zero mapcount? I am
throwing that more as an idea because I haven't really thought that
through yet.

Yes, it seems that the regular lock drop&relock helps in Minchan's case
but this is a kind of change that might have other subtle side effects.
E.g. will-it-scale has noticed a regression [1], likely because the
critical section is shorter and the overal throughput of the operation
decreases. Now, the w-i-s is an artificial benchmark so I wouldn't lose
much sleep over it normally but we have already seen real regressions
when the locking pattern has changed in the past so I would by a bit
cautious. 

As I've said, this RFC is mostly to open a discussion. I would really
like to weigh the overhead of mark_page_accessed and potential scenario
when refaults would be visible in practice. I can imagine that a short
lived statically linked applications have higher chance of being the
only user unlike libraries which are often being mapped via several
ptes. But the main problem to evaluate this is that there are many other
external factors to trigger the worst case.
