Yes we can do it in run-time, i mean to detect context type, atomic or not.
But only for CONFIG_PREEMPT kernel. In case of !CONFIG_PREEMPT configuration 
i do not see a straight forward way how to detect it. For example when caller 
holds "spinlock". Therefore for such configuration we can just consider it
as atomic. But in reality it could be not in atomic.

We need it for emergency/corner case and head-less objects. When we are run
of memory. So in this case we should attach the rcu_head dynamically and
queue the freed object to be processed later on, after GP.

If atomic context use GFP_ATOMIC flag if not use GFP_KERNEL. It is better 
to allocate with GFP_KERNEL flag(if possible) because it has much less
restrictions then GFP_ATOMIC one, i.e. GFP_KERNEL can sleep and wait until
the memory is reclaimed.

But that is a corner case and i agree that it would be good to avoid of
such passing of extra info by the caller.

Anyway i just share some extra info :)

Thanks.
