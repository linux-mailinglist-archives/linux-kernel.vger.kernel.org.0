I definitely agree that having a non-working command here is doing
more harm than good. Whether we just get rid of it, or change it to
use the --defconfig option is a matter of taste. (Personally, I think
there's some value in having a one-line "run the tests" command at the
top of the Getting Started page, but it definitely needs to be one
that works.)

So, overall, I think this is definitely an improvement, but that we do
need to choose whether to take this approach (deleting this command)
or the --defconfig approach as in:

I generally think we want to keep the "Getting Started" guide focused
on the goal (running/writing tests), rather than too much detail on
the implementation (the wrapper itself).
How about renaming what's currently the "KUnit Wrapper" section to
"Running tests" or similar, and moving the kunitconfig part under
that?

The "Creating a kunitconfig" part could equally be "configuring which
tests to run" or something, which may speak more to motivating

As for some sort of tie-in, perhaps rewording the opening sentence to
say "The easiest way to run tests is to use the kunit_tool script",
and link to the page kunit_tool page in the patch below?

As above, my slight preference is for adding the --defconfig option
over removing the section entirely.
