Yes - the concern is collision.

The "Subject Key Identifier" (SKI) for no two certificate can be the 
same. But since we are using only the last 4 bytes of the SKI it can 
collide. That's mainly the reason I want to log the entire public key.

IMA log is backed by the TPM. So if the public key is added to the IMA 
log the attestation service can validate the key information.
I am not sure if that answers your question.

Mimi had raised the same concern. I will update my implementation to 
include the certification information in the IMA log only once per key - 
when that key is added to the IMA or Platform keyring.
