Agreed. The way I /think/ it works is that on many SoCs there is a
system/last-level cache (LLC) which effectively sits in front of memory for
all masters. Even if a device isn't coherent with the CPU caches, we still
want to be able to allocate into the LLC. Why this doesn't happen
automatically is beyond me, but it appears that on these Qualcomm designs
you actually have to set the memory attributes up in the page-table to
ensure that the resulting memory transactions are non-cacheable for the CPU
but cacheable for the LLC. Without any changes, the transactions are
non-cacheable in both of them which assumedly has a performance cost.

But you can see that I'm piecing things together myself here. Isaac?

Yes, in this case I was hoping a user would materialise via a different
tree, but it didn't happen, hence my post last week about removing this
altogether:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/20191024153832.GA7966@jcrouse1-lnx.qualcomm.com/T/#t

which I suspect prompted this patch that unfortunately fails to solve the
problem.
