AFAIUI the requirement for the enum type is that it has to be an int type that
covers all its values, so I could see some funky optimization (e.g. check the
returned value is < 512 but it's assumed the type for the enum is 8 bits so
this becomes always true). Then again we don't have any explicit check on
those returned values, plus they fit in 11 bits, so as you say it's
mostly likely inconsequential (and I didn't see any compile diff).

My "worry" wasn't really about this patch, it was more about the following
one - it didn't like the idea of merging an unneeded patch (with a Fixes:
tag on top of it).

This sounds good to me. Sorry for the hassle.
