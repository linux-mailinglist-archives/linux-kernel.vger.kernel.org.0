Can you give me a pointer to your tree and how to build a relocatable kernel?
Weak undefined symbols have the absolute value 0, but the kernel is linked at
an address such that 0 can't be reached by normal means.  When I added support
to binutils for this I did it in a way that required almost no code --
essetially I just stopped dissallowing x0 as a possible base register for PCREL
relocations, which results in 0 always being accessible.  I just wanted to get
the kernel to build again, so I didn't worry about chasing around all the
addressing modes.  The PIC/PIE support generates different relocations and I
wouldn't be surprised if I just missed one (or more likely all) of them.

It's probably a simple fix, though I feel like every time I say that about the
linker I end up spending a month in there...
