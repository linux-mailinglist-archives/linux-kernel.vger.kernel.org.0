Your feedback is contradicting what PeterZ requested[0]. Particularly
when multiple lines are involved with a description, I find the spacing
helpful. I've grown to like the spacing, but I won't fight for it.

When I was first implementing RFCv3, the "human-readable" text version
was very useful for me. However, now it is the formal descriptions that
I find more useful. They provide the proof and a far more detailed
description.

I'll respond to this part in Sergey's followup post.

The variable's value (in this case db->id) is doing the guarding. The
barriers ensure that db->id is read first (and set last).
