ok ... I'm halfway convinced ;-) .

The big thing I want to see is that secure setting in the actual firmware.
Aka right now you probably have that in your Rockchip-specific ATF fork
and I really want to see the relevant change for public uboot or ATF.

I don't necessarily require it to be fully merged before taking this, but
I really want to see the change either on a mailing list or atf gerrit
instance [that makes the crypto engine secure only].

Rationale behind this is that we don't care very much about private stuff
that the general ecosystem doesn't benefit from.


Thanks
Heiko
