LCA2020 Kernel Miniconf - Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia - 2020-01-14
------------------------------------------------------------------------

******

LCA Kernel Miniconf submissions open!

Submissions close: 2019-12-08 (early submissions until 2019-11-17)

Submissions: https://linux.conf.au/proposals/submit/kernel-miniconf/

More info: https://lca-kernel.ozlabs.org/2020-cfs.html

******

linux.conf.au 2020 will be held at the Gold Coast Convention and 
Exhibition Centre, from 13-17 January 2020. The Kernel Miniconf is 
returning once again to discuss all things kernel.

The Kernel Miniconf is a single-day miniconf track about everything 
related to the kernel and low-level systems programming.

The Kernel Miniconf will focus on a variety of kernel-related topics - 
technical presentations on up-and-coming kernel developments, the future 
direction of the kernel, and kernel development community and process 
matters. Past Kernel Miniconfs have included technical talks on topics 
such as memory management, RCU, scheduling and filesystems, as well as 
talks on Linux kernel community topics such as licensing and Linux 
kernel development process.

We invite submissions on anything related to kernel and low-level 
systems programming. We welcome submissions from developers of all 
levels of experience in the kernel community, covering a broad range of 
topics. The focus of the miniconf will primarily be on Linux, however 
non-Linux talks of sufficient interest to a primarily Linux audience 
will be considered.

Early Close Date: 2019-11-17, midnight Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)
Final Close Date: 2019-12-08, midnight Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)
Submissions: https://linux.conf.au/proposals/submit/kernel-miniconf/
