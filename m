Hello Nathan,

Thanks for reviewing the patch!

If there's no kernel or hypervisor bug, it shouldn't take more than a
few tens of ms for this loop to complete (Gautham measured a maximum of
10 ms on a POWER9 with an earlier version of this patch).

In case of bugs related to CPU hotplug (either in the kernel or the
hypervisor), I was hoping that the resulting lockup warnings would be a
good indicator that something is wrong. :-)

Though perhaps adding a cond_resched() every 10 ms or so, with a
WARN_ON() if it loops for more than 50 ms would be better.

I'll send an alternative patch.
