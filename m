Linus noted that he believes that compilers for architectures supporting
Linux can be trusted to avoid store-to-load transformations, invented
stores, and unnecessary store tearing.  Should these appear, Linus would
report a bug against the compiler and expect it to be fixed.

There is significant unclarity inherent in the situation.  The standard
says one thing, different compilers do other things, and developers
often expect yet a third thing.  And sometimes things change over time,
for example, the ca. 2011 dictim against compilers inventing data races.

Hey, they didn't teach me this aspect of software development in school,
either.  ;-)
