The isolate path of non-lru movable pages:

isolate_migratepages_block
	isolate_movable_page
		trylock_page
		// if PageIsolated, goto out_no_isolated
		a_ops->isolate_page
		__SetPageIsolated
		unlock_page
	list_add(&page->lru, &cc->migratepages)

The migration path:

unmap_and_move
	__unmap_and_move
		lock_page
		move_to_new_page
			a_ops->migratepage
			__ClearPageIsolated
		unlock_page
	/* here, the page could be isolated again by another thread, and added into another cc->migratepages,
	since PG_Isolated has been cleared, and not protected by page_lock */
	list_del(&page->lru)

Suppose thread A isolates three pages in the order p1, p2, p3, A's cc->migratepages will be like
	head_A - p3 - p2 - p1
After p2 is migrated (but before list_del), it is isolated by another thread B. Then list_del will delete p2
from the cc->migratepages of B (instead of A). When A continues to migrate and delete p1, it will find:
	p1->prev == p2
	p2->next == LIST_POISON1. 

So we will end up with a bug like
"list_del corruption. prev->next should be ffffffbf0a1eb8e0, but was dead000000000100"
(see __list_del_entry_valid).

Care to explain the race? Both paths use page_lock AFAICS
