That's debatable and we have done that so extensively so far.
So what I am saying is to implement different modes not just one so that
as many use-case are addressed.

I disagree. It's configurable and vendors can just choose 2 instead of
100s as you mentioned based on the use-case and needs. So we will still
need the same there.

While I don't dislike or disagree with separate transport in SCMI which
I have invested time and realised that I will duplicate mailbox framework
at the end. So I am against it only because of duplication and extra
layer of indirection which has performance impact(we have this seen in
sched governor for DVFS). So idea wise, it's good and I don't disagree
with practically seen performance impact. Hence I thought it's sane to
do something I am proposing. It also avoids coming up with virtual DT
nodes for this layer of abstract which I am completely against.
