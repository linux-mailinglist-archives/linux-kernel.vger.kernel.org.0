Okay, if it's about consistency then there will be more cases to fix.

What about this one:

My interpretation of the documentation has been that I should end the
comment after the identifiers:

/* SPDX-... */
/* ...
 */

Some people deviate by doing

/* SPDX-...
 * foo
 */

So the documentation may need to be extended to clarify that for full
consistency, as well as clarify the previous scenario:
  "If a specific tool cannot handle the standard comment style, then the
   appropriate comment mechanism which the tool accepts shall be used."
To me that reads very different from what you just said above.

Thanks,
Andreas
