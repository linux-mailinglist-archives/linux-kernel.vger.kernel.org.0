Let me put it this way: Since the code in this series does not utilize
the connection description, it actually should _not_ propose the
binding for it. The connection description is out side the scope of
the series.

The connection description is still far from being clear in any case.

You are not suggesting anything for the identification problem below,
so how do we know where does an endpoint actually go to in the code?

But could you actually please first explain what exactly is the
benefit from using OF graph with with the USB Type-C connector? Why
not just use good old phandles, i.e. device properties that return
reference to a node? With those the device property name by itself is
the identifier.

Note. USB2 and USB3 are separate ports.

I don't still see any kind of independent device nodes for the USB
ports? Is the idea to only have the OF graph "ports" to represent the
physical USB ports?

It was clearly a mistake to talk about PHY, but in any case...

All the physical ports really need to have their own device nodes. If
we are to use OF graph, then a OF graph "port" is an interface to a
physical USB port, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt 3 port, whatever port,
that then has an endpoint to the connector. OF graph ports are
generic, and they can not represent physical points on the hardware,
while the USB, DP, whatever ports are specific and represent the
physical points on the hardware.

So basically, the OF graph describes the connection (the interconnect)
between the physical ports on the components and the connector, but it
does _not_ describe the connectors nor the physical ports themselves.

That is the only way I see this ever working. Otherwise you don't have
a clear place where to put for example device nodes describing
integrated USB devices, or even a clear way to describe port specific
properties.

Is this actually necessary? You will never associate the connector in
this case with a real device entry (struct device), so why define the
node at all?

The node will give you the connector type, but since (AFAIK) that
information is not used anywhere in case of Type-A, why bother?

If you use the mux between the DP and the connector, then you actually
should do the same with the USB ports as well. They will after all go
trough the same mux, right?

But using the mux in the middle even with the DP is problematic. We
will simply not always have a mux to control. Therefore our plan was
to always describe the connections directly from the connector to
whatever location they ultimately go to without the mux in the middle.
The mux will have its connection described in the connector node, but
in parallel.

I'll skip the rest if it's OK. I think at this point we really need an
explanation to the question: why do we have to use OF graph with the
USB Type-C connectors at all?

The identification problem has to be solved if it is to be used in any
case, but in the end, what value does OF graph add? Right now it looks
like something that just adds unnecessary complexity.

I'm sure that it is useful when it is possible to predict where the
endpoints actually go. For example with the cameras, every endpoint
an image processor has is most likely a sensor. But the USB Type-C
connectors can go anywhere (I guess even to the image processor).

With USB Type-C connector, the good old reference properties would
simply be superior.
