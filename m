From what I understand, a process acquires a write lock on a rwsem, then
got killed before releasing it. A pointer to the task structure will
remain in the rwsem structure. This pointer is primarily used for
optimistic spinning purpose on the on_cpu flag of the task structure.
Depending on the setting on the setting of the on_cpu flag, the spinning
task either continues spinning until its time quantum has expired or go
to sleep immediately. It is read-only access and no write to the task
structure will happen. No real harm should happen unless the memory of
the freed task structure become inaccessible. The bigger problem is that
the tasks that try to acquire the lock will hang waiting for the lock to
be freed. This use-after-free problem is the lesser of the 2 evils, IMHO.

The optimistic spinning mechanism is there for both rwsem and mutex. So
the same problem will happen if the killed task hold a mutex instead of
a rwsem. There is currently no code to detect if the task structure
pointed to by the owner field is legit or not.
