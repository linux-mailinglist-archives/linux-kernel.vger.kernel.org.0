I do agree that simple_empty() is wrong, for the reasons you pointed out.

It should be fine, my worry is that we may be missing a lockdep
annotation, that might confuse lockdep, as lockdep may see this as the
same type of lock being taken, and wont know the order.

Have you tried this patch with lockdep enabled and tried to hit this
code path?
