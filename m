As already mentioned in our previous discussion I am really not happy
about exporting oom_score withtout a larger context - aka other tasks
scores to have something to compare against. Other than that the value
is an internal implementation detail and it is meaningless without
knowing the exact algorithm which can change at any times so no
userspace should really depend on it. All important metrics should be
displayed by the oom report message already.
