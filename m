The current text includes the wiki link, but yes, the anchor tag is not
present at the wiki anymore. I would agree that's due for updating.

I think reinforcing information to avoid past mistakes is appropriate
here. Reports have regularly missed the "[vs]" detail or suggested
embargoes that ended on Fridays, etc.

What? No, I'm saying we should _keep_ linux-distros@... in our text so
that people don't send to the wrong list.

That URL is a combined page for two lists. The very fact that it's
not obvious that there are two lists described there is exactly why I
think we need to keep an explicit mention of which to use. There are
two mailing lists described at the wiki URL:

	      distros@lists.openwall.com
	linux-distros@lists.openwall.com

Sending to the distros@ list risks exposing Linux-only flaws to non-Linux
distros. This has caused leaks in the past, and we do not want people
guessing at which list they should use.

Also note that nowhere on the openwall wiki is the email address
actually spelled out; this is another reason to spell it out in our
documentation: no misunderstanding.

(And historically there WAS a specific linux-distros wiki:
https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/linux-distros
but it redirects to the combined one now...)

It's a distro preference. Many researchers aren't thinking about the
larger Linux ecosystem that has to consume fixes. It's not a _policy_,
but it makes the researchers understand how to construct better embargoes.

I think it'd be a good idea to add that note also to the wiki, but I
don't want it removed from our text because I have had to repeat that
information regularly in the past.
