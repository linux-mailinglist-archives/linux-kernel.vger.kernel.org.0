Can you add "thunderbolt.dyndbg" to the kernel command line and
reproduce this? That gives bit more information what might be happening.

I'm suspecting that the boot firmware does configure second DP path also
and we either fail to discover it properly or the boot firmware fails to
set it up.

Also if you boot with one monitor connected and then connect another
(when the system is up) does it work then?
