Oops, sorry - as you might imagine I'm not in my normal workflow :)

Let me rebase that onto something actually in your tree (rather than 
whatever detached HEAD this is checked out out on my laptop...) and try 
resending it properly.

Cool, let me know if you need a hand with all the *_iommu_configure()

imminently, so it probably is worthwhile to do the straightforward 
housekeeping first.
