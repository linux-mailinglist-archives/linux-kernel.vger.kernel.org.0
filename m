The "if" here could be changed to "else if" because if add_to_swap()
fails we don't need to call PageTransHuge() here.  But this isn't a big
deal.

You have analyzed the code and found that nr_dirty, nr_unqueued_dirty,
nr_congested and nr_writeback are file cache related and not impacted by
THP swap out.  How about add your findings in the patch description?
