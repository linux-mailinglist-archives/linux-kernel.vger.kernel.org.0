Hi Robin,

Actually, none of this is special Android magic. Will is talking about
the of_devlink feature that's been merged into driver-core-next.

A one line summary of of_devlink: the driver core + firmware (DT in
this case) automatically add the device links during device addition
based on the firmware properties of each device. The link that Will
gave has more details.

Wrt IOMMUs, the only missing piece in upstream is a trivial change
that does something like this in drivers/of/property.c

+static struct device_node *parse_iommus(struct device_node *np,
+                                        const char *prop_name, int index)
+{
+        return parse_prop_cells(np, prop_name, index, "iommus",
+                                "#iommu-cells");
+}

static const struct supplier_bindings of_supplier_bindings[] = {
        { .parse_prop = parse_clocks, },
        { .parse_prop = parse_interconnects, },
        { .parse_prop = parse_regulators, },
+        { .parse_prop = parse_iommus, },
        {},
};

I plan to upstream this pretty soon, but I have other patches in
flight that touch the same file and I'm waiting for those to get
accepted. I also want to clean up the code a bit to reduce some
repetition before I add support for more bindings.

Thanks,
Saravana
