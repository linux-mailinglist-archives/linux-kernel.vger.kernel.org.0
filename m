Muchun, I don't think Greg still has the previous emails. He deals with
too much to keep track of old stuff.

Can you send both patches tagged as [OPT1] and [OPT2] along with a
comment in one go so Greg can see both and decide ?

I think looking at the refcount is fragile, I might be wrong, but I
think it mostly paper over the root of the problem which is the fact
that the lock isn't taken accross both operations, thus exposing the
race. But I'm happy if Greg prefers your approach as long as it's
fixed.

Cheers,
Ben.
