What would prevent other pages mapped via page tables to be handled as
well?

I am not sure I see the problem. If you dissolve the hugetlb page then
there is no hugetlb page anymore and so you make it a regular high-order
page.

If the page is free then it shouldn't pin the memcg or any other state.
