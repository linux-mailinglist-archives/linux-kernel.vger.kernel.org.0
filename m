Yeah and I strongly suspect they are consoles which are broken and need
to be fixed rathert than the problem papered over.

I do realize how tempting it is to remove all printks from the
zone->lock but do realize that as soon as the allocator starts using any
other locks then we are back to square one and the problem is there
again. We would have to drop _all_ printks from any locked section in
the allocator and I do not think this is viable.

Really, the only way forward is to make these consoles be more careful
of external dependencies.

I am also wondering, this code is there for a long time (or is there any
recent change?), why are we seeing reports only now? Are those consoles
rarely used or you are simply luck to hit those? Or are those really
representing a deadlock? Maybe the lockdep is just confused? I am not
familiar with the code but console_owner_lock is doing some complex
stuff to hand over the context.
