If the SMC_UNK is returned, then we keep the IOMUX_GPR1 bit 12 set and the =
IMR1 bit 0
for that core unset. That would always wake up the cores and therefore no t=
he
cpuidle will not have any effect.

Again, this workaround will only apply to i.MX8MQ. IIRC, the gic500 was the
one that added the wake_request signals, gic400 didn't gave them.
And i.MX8MQ is the first NXP SoC to use the gic500. All the newer i.MX SoC
which use GPCv2 don't have this issue. So it's obviously related to
the switch from gic400 to gic500 when interfacing with GPCv2.

Fair point. TBH, I used the same naming I found in some other subsystems up=
stream.
If you grep the tree for IMX_SIP you will find IMX_SIP_TIMER, IMX_SIP_SRTC =
and
IMX_SIP_CPUFREQ.

So I only followed the pattern here.

Right, but how will you know in EL3 that an IPI has been raised ?
