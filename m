threads: Update PID limit comment according to futex UAPI change

The futex UAPI changed back in commit 76b81e2b0e22 ("[PATCH] lightweight
robust futexes updates 2"), which landed in v2.6.17: FUTEX_TID_MASK is now
0x3fffffff instead of 0x1fffffff. Update the corresponding comment in
include/linux/threads.h.

Documentation mentions that only the lower 29 bits are available for TID
storage, but as the UAPI header released the bit already via
FUTEX_TID_MASK, this is moot as well. Fix it up.
