I just staged the following DM fix:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-5.6&id=28a101d6b344f5a38d482a686d18b1205bc92333

Subject: [PATCH] dm: fix potential for q->make_request_fn NULL pointer

Move blk_queue_make_request() to dm.c:alloc_dev() so that
q->make_request_fn is never NULL during the lifetime of a DM device
(even one that is created without a DM table).

Otherwise generic_make_request() will crash simply by doing:
  dmsetup create -n test
  mount /dev/dm-N /mnt

While at it, move ->congested_data initialization out of
dm.c:alloc_dev() and into the bio-based specific init method.
