Looking deeper into the code, the exact migration type is not stored in
the page itself. An initial movable page can be stolen to be put into
another migration type. So in a delete or move from free_area, we don't
know exactly what migration type the page is coming from. IOW, it is
hard to get accurate counts of the number of entries in each lists.

I am not saying this is impossible, but doing it may require stealing
some bits from the page structure to store this information which is
probably not worth the benefit we can get from it. So if you have any
good suggestion of how to do it without too much cost, please let me
know about it. Otherwise, I will probably stay with the current patch.

Cheers,
Longman
