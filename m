I wrote a test case to compare these two methods, but not find visible
difference in run time.

While I found we may leverage rb_last to refine the code a little.

@@ -2270,12 +2270,9 @@ find_vma_prev(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned long addr,
        if (vma) {
                *pprev = vma->vm_prev;

Not sure this style would help a little in understanding the code?
