This is the 3rd revision of the patch set to introduce
latency_{nice/tolerance} as a per task attribute.

The previous version can be found at:
v1: https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/11/25/151
v2: https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/12/8/10

Changes in this revision are:
v2 -> v3:
- This series changes the longer attribute name to "latency_nice" as per
  the comment from Dietmar Eggemann https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/12/5/394
v1 -> v2:
- Addressed comments from Qais Yousef
- As per suggestion from Dietmar, moved content from newly created
  include/linux/sched/latency_tolerance.h to kernel/sched/sched.h
- Extend sched_setattr() to support latency_tolerance in tools headers UAPI


Introduction:
==============
This patch series introduces a new per-task attribute latency_nice to
provide the scheduler hints about the latency requirements of the task [1].

Latency_nice is a ranged attribute of a task with the value ranging
from [-20, 19] both inclusive which makes it align with the task nice
value.

The value should provide scheduler hints about the relative latency
requirements of tasks, meaning the task with "latency_nice = -20"
should have lower latency requirements than compared to those tasks with
higher values. Similarly a task with "latency_nice = 19" can have higher
latency and hence such tasks may not care much about latency.

The default value is set to 0. The usecases discussed below can use this
range of [-20, 19] for latency_nice for the specific purpose. This
patch does not implement any use cases for such attribute so that any
change in naming or range does not affect much to the other (future)
patches using this. The actual use of latency_nice during task wakeup
and load-balancing is yet to be coded for each of those usecases.

As per my view, this defined attribute can be used in following ways for a
some of the usecases:
1 Reduce search scan time for select_idle_cpu():
- Reduce search scans for finding idle CPU for a waking task with lower
  latency_nice values.

2 TurboSched:
- Classify the tasks with higher latency_nice values as a small
  background task given that its historic utilization is very low, for
  which the scheduler can search for more number of cores to do task
  packing.  A task with a latency_nice >= some_threshold (e.g, == 19)
  and util <= 12.5% can be background tasks.

3 Optimize AVX512 based workload:
- Bias scheduler to not put a task having (latency_nice == -20) on a
  core occupying AVX512 based workload.


Series Organization:
====================
- Patch 1: Add new attribute latency_nice to task_struct.
- Patch 2: Clone parent task's attribute to the child task on fork
- Patch 3: Add support for sched_{set,get}attr syscall to modify
  	     latency_nice of the task


The patch series can be applied on tip/sched/core at the
commit 804d402fb6f6 ("sched/rt: Make RT capacity-aware")
