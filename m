Right, so we had a wee conversation about this patch series at OSPM, and
I don't see any of that reflected here :-(

Specifically, given that some people _really_ want the whole L3 mask
scanned to reduce tail latency over raw throughput, while you guys
prefer the other way around, it was proposed to extend the task model.

Specifically something like a latency-nice was mentioned (IIRC) where a
task can give a bias but not specify specific behaviour. This is very
important since we don't want to be ABI tied to specific behaviour.

Some of the things we could tie to this would be:

  - select_idle_siblings; -nice would scan more than +nice,

  - wakeup preemption; when the wakee has a relative smaller
    latency-nice value than the current running task, it might preempt
    sooner and the other way around of course.

  - pack-vs-spread; +nice would pack more with like tasks (since we
    already spread by default [0] I don't think -nice would affect much
    here).


Hmmm?
