What we really want to distingush here is the use of display_mode
and display_timings (if I got the names right).
That display_mode specify a fixed timing and display_timing specify
a valid range is something in the semantics of the two types.
So naming that refer to display_mode versus display_timing will make the
code simpler to understand. and then a nice comment that when
display_mode
is used one looses the possibility to use override_mode.
That would be fine to have in the struct in the driver.

Let's give the patches a spin more as we have passed the possibility for
the current merge window.

I am on vacation at the moment and thus slow in responses, but will be back
at the home office next week and will be more responsive again.
