We used to have this on ARM - it was called from the decompressor
code via an arch_decomp_wdog() hook.

That code got removed because it is entirely unsuitable for a multi-
platform kernel.  This looks like it takes an address for the watchdog
from the Kconfig, and builds that into the decompressor, making the
decompressor specific to that board or platform.

I'm not sure distros are going to like that given where we are with
multiplatform kernels.
