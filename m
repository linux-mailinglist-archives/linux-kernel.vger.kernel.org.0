I don't see anything architecture specific in here. When the option was
made generic instead of x86 specific, I fixed a ton of bugs that showed
up all over the place. If we don't want it on arm64, I'd suggest making
it a per-architecture opt-in instead of an opt-out.

Sorry, that reference was unclear, I meant the text for commit 3f9b5cc01856,
which in turn contains a citation of the earlier 4f81c5350b44bc commit.

The point is that function inlining frequently causes all kinds of problems
when code was written in a way that is not entirely reproducible but
depends on the behavior of a particular implementation. I've fixed
lots of bugs based on any of these:

- gcc-4.0 and higher started ignoring 'inline' without
  __attribute__((always_inline)), so a workaround got applied
  in 2.6.26, and this turned into CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=n
  later
- gcc -O2 makes different decisions compared to -Os and -O3,
  which is an endless source of "uninitialized variable" warnings
  and similar problems
- Some configuration options like KASAN grow the code to result
  in less inlining
- clang and gcc behave completely differently
- gcc is traditionally bad at guessing the size of inline assembly
  to make a good decision
- newer compilers tend to get better at identifying which functions
  benefit from inlining, which changes the balance

CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING clearly adds to that mess, but it's
not the worst part. The only real solution tends to be to write
portable and correct code rather than making assumptions
about compiler behavior.
