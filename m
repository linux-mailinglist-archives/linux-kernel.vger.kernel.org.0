Subject: [PATCH v3 1/1] blk-mq: fill header with kernel-doc

Insert documentation for structs, enums and functions at header file.
Format existing and new comments at struct blk_mq_ops as
kernel-doc comments.

Hello,

This patch is an effort to enhance the documentation of the multiqueue
API. To check if the comments are confirming to kernel-doc format, you
first need to apply a patch[1] solving a bug around the `__cacheline...`
directive. Then, just run

./scripts/kernel-doc -none include/linux/blk-mq.h

to check that there is no warning at this documentation. I've done my
best at the source to check the purpose of each struct and its members,
but please let me know if I get something wrong.

Changes since v2:
- Rewrite and improve definition of a lot of members (thanks
Bart and Gabriel!)

Changes since v1:
- Fix the meaning of PDU
- Uses nested comments for long structs
- Slight reword member definition to look closer to work made at commit
"block: Document all members of blk_mq_tag_set and bkl_mq_queue_map"
