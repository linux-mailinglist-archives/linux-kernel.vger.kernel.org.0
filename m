Memblock flags are fun because they have to be provided to the walkers like
for_each_mem_range().

Unless hot remove is a hot path, it should be enough to check against the UEFI memory map
or DT memory node. (we already have helpers to query the attributes from the memory map at
runtime, so it is still available).

It does, but t = first-boot

This would imply we rewrite the tables we get from firmware as the facts about the
platform change ... that way madness lies!

ACPI doesn't describe memory, the UEFI memory map does. You may be using the UEFI memory
map on either a DT or ACPI system. If you don't have UEFI, you're using the DT memory-node.

Linux passes on exactly what it had at boot through kexec. We don't rewrite the tables.
Memory is either described in DT, or in the UEFI memory map that was left in memory by the
EFI stub. Linux remembers where the UEFI memory map is through kexec using the additional
entries in the DT chosen node that were put there by the EFI stub.


The bootloader (including the EFI stub) needs to know what memory is removable. Certain
allocations can't move once they have been made:
 * The kernel's randomised physical address should not be in removable memory. With UEFI,
   the EFI stub does this.
 * Firmware structures like the DT or ACPI tables should not be in removable memory.
   Neither should reservations for runtime use, like the RAS CPER regions, or the UEFI
   runtime services.
 * The EFI stub should not allocate the authoritative copy of the memory map in removable
   memory. (we have runtime helpers to lookup the attributes. we pass the boot-time memory
   map to the next OS via kexec).
 * During paging_init() we allocate memory for swapper_pg_dir. This isn't something we can
easily move around.

Its not just software!:
 * The GIC ITS property/pending (?) tables should not be in removable memory.


The simplest thing to do here is decree that all memory present at boot, is non-removable.
Firmware may need to trim the memory available to UEFI to the minimum needed to boot the
system, we can hot-add the rest of it once we're up and running.

Firmware can't know that we kexec'd, so it can't replay the operations.

I think we need a way of determining whether a particular block of removable memory is
present or not. If we do this during boot, then kexec works in the same way as a normal boot.

Yes. The UEFI memory map.

See drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/fdt.c::exit_boot_func()
the EFI stub calls efi_get_virtmap() to get the running memory map, then stores in the DT
with update_fdt_memmap().

The memory described at this stage may not be removed as allocations from the EFI stub
can't be moved. The biggest of these, is the kernel, which relocates itself to a random
physical address during the EFI stub.

See drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/arm64-stub.c::handle_kernel_image()
The memcpy() is at the end.

Mmm, a linux specific description of the platform that we have to keep over kexec.

How do we describe this if we kexec something that isn't linux? How do we tell a version
of linux that doesn't support hotplug not to overwrite it?

It would be better if we had something in ACPI to tell us at runtime whether a hot
pluggable range of memory was populated.

(I haven't looked to see whether ACPI can already do this)



Thanks,

James
