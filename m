Agreed. The enum was originally due to me trying to figure out all the
different cases happening separately from how we react to them. In fact
I'm not even convinced we don't have bugs in the latter (the failure
path of Braille consoles is dubious).

In any case, I'm back now, I'll try to respin this week.
