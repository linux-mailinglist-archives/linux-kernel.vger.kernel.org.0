Hello, Joey, all,

Let me address both of your emails here.

Indeed, as far as I understand the code, we keep var's data in a memory. I
cannot tell why such was done when this code was written. Given that this
code is considered "old" and may even be obsoleted, I wouldn't like to start
a deep rewrite, and only focus on fixing bugs, like the one mentioned.

Thank you for your time on the review! Much appreciated. Still, I've just
sent out a v2 patch (with you in To:) which is indeed simpler and implements
and idea Ard suggested, and fixes only the exact bug mentioned. I'm not sure
which one will be accepted (if any), could you please, to look at v2 also?
