*groan*, The only way I can explain this is...

... because we changed the definition of LFENCE from:

 - wait until completion of all prior LOADs

to

 - wait until completion of all prior instructions

Because Spectre (and because apparently it was implemented that way,
mostly). It could be that MFENCE, which is basically a completion
barrier for all prior LOADs *AND* STOREs, is no longer a stict superset
of LFENCE anymore...

Which makes the otherwise perverted sequence: MFENCE;LFENCE, actually
mean something :/

la-la-la

Would be good to have that clarified though.
