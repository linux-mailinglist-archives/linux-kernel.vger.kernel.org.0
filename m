Out of curiosity: what makes the new flag different than say
CLONE_NEWCGROUP or any new clone flag that got introduced?
CLONE_NEWCGROUP too would not be detectable apart from the method I gave
you above; same for other clone flags. Why are you so keen on being able
to detect this flag when other flags didn't seem to matter that much.
(Again, mere curiosity.)

Please send a patch for review.
