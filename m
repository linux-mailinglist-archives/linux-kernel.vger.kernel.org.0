The existing mechanism would work functionally, but the cost of an
indirect call for all the hooks, even those that are completely unused
is not really acceptable for KRSI’s use cases. It’s easy to avoid and
I do think that what we’re doing here (with hooks being defined at
runtime) has significant functional differences from existing LSMs.
