IMHO the real problem is kernel-doc doing too much preprocessing on the
input, preventing us from doing what would be the sensible thing in
rst. The more we try to fix the problem by adding more kernel-doc
processing, the further we dig ourselves into this hole.

If kernel-doc didn't have its own notion of section headers, such as
"example:", we wouldn't have this problem to begin with. We could just
use the usual rst construct; "example::" followed by an indented block.

I'm not going to stand in the way of the patch, but I'm telling you,
this is going to get harder, not easier, on this path.


BR,
Jani.
