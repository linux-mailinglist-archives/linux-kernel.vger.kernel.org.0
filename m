I definitely had KTF and KUnit in mind when proposing this topic.
If you recall from the last time we discussed unit testing, each slot is 
fairly limited in time. My plan for the intro for discussion is to 
itemize some of the distinct goals we try to achieve with our frameworks and have a
discussion based on that. In light of the discussion around your patch sets,
one topic is also the question of whether a common API would be useful/desired, 
and whether we can "capture" a short namespace for that.

Thanks,
Knut
