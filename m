Not quite. Andrew noted that we may not want to expose all CMA regions
via dmabuf heaps, so right now we only expose the default region. I
have follow on patches that I sent out earlier (which requires a
to-be-finalized DT binding) which allows us to specify which other CMA
regions to expose.

No.  CMA core isn't available as a module.

I agree that is maybe not the most critical item on the list, but its
one of many that do add up over time.

Again, I'll defer to Sandeep or other folks on the Google side to help
with the importance here. Mostly I'm trying to ensure there is
functional parity to ION so we don't give folks any reason they could
object to deprecating it.

I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand what you mean here (I'm not sure
what action I should be taking). Could you clarify this point?
