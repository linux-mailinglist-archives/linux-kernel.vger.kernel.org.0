Hi Greg,

Thanks for raising various issues that I have repeatedly asked and
constantly ignored.

Exactly and they keep saying there partners are using these for 3-4 years
and they want to retain that. I have told them to change several times.

Oh yes, this is so broken in design. This firmware is designed to abstract
the power and configuration management on their platform, but they decided
to add direct register access to some registers anyway. Weird use case,
don't even ask. But I strongly objected such interface in sysfs even if
they moved under platform device. If they need this at any cost, I have
suggested debugfs.

+1, and please don't add any sysfs that can read/write those GGS registers
directly from userspace. Move them to debugfs if you are desperate to have
something.
