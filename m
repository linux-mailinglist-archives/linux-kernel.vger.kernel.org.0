Do you have a typical nvme_irq() completion time for a mid-range x86 server?

Well a problem with so many CPUs is that it does not scale (well) with 
MQ devices, like NVMe.

As CPU count goes up, device queue count doesn't and we get more contention.

There would be the IOVA management, but that would be common to x86. 
Each CPU keeps an IOVA cache, and there is a central pool of cached 
IOVAs, so that reduces any contention, unless the caches are exhausted.

I think most contention/bottleneck is at the SMMU HW interface, which 
has a single queue interface.

Thanks,
