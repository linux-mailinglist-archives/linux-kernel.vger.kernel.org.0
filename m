Actually, it makes no sense at all. Current implementation for anx6345
driver works fine as is with any panel specified assuming panel delays
are long enough for connected panel. It just doesn't use panel timings
from the driver. Creating a platform driver for connector itself looks
redundant since it can't be reused, it doesn't describe actual
hardware and it's just defeats purpose of DT by introducing
board-specific code.

There's another issue: if we introduce edp-connector we'll have to
specify power up delays somewhere (in dts? or in platform driver?), so
edp-connector doesn't really solve the issue of multiple panels with
same motherboard.

I'd say DT overlays should be preferred solution here, not another
connector binding.
