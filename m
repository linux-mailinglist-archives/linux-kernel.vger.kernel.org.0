Yeah, sorry that I am throwing incomplete ideas at you. I am just trying
to really nail down how to deal with reference counting here because it
is an important aspect.

The point is that if the owner of the page is holding the only reference
to the page then it is clear that nothing like that's happened.

OK

I do not like exactly this part

Well, driver should make the page unreferenced or fail. What is done
really depends on the specific driver

Only previous PageBuddy pages are returned to the allocator IIRC. Mostly
because of MovablePage()

Yep

Simply skip over PageOffline pages. Reference count should never be != 0
at this stage.

Yes

Aparat from no hooks into __put_page it is also an explicit control over
the page via reference counting. Do you see any downsides?
