TL;DR I see merit in the recursive propagation if it's requested
explicitly (i.e. retaining meaining of 0). The protection/weight
semantics should be refined.

Yes, but for overcommited only. For pure weights it doesn't matter if
you set 1:10, 10:100 or 100:1000, however, for the protection it has
this behavior only when approaching infinity and as the sum compares to
parent's value, the protection behaves differently.

[If there had to be to some pure memory weights, those would for
instance express relative affinity of group's pages to physical memory.]

I'll try coming up with some better examples for the difference that I
perceive.

I want to express absolute amount of memory (ideally representing
workingset size) under protection.

IIUC, you want to express general relative priorities of B vs C when
some outer metric has to be maintained given you reach both limits of
memory and IO.

I acknowledge that by pressing too much along one dimension (memory) you
induce expansion in other dimension (IO) and that may become noticable in
siblings (expansion over saturation [1]). But that's expected when only
weights are in use. If you wanted to hide the effect of workload B to C,
B would need real limit.

[I beg to disagree that containerization is whole point of cgroups, it's
large part of it, hence the isolation needn't be necessarily
bi-directional.]

Just to sync up the terminology - I'm calling this protection against
uncles (the composition/structure under them is irrelevant).
And the limitation comes from grandparent or higher (or global).

=2E..and the overriden parental resource assignment is the expansion on
non-memory dimension (IO/CPU).

That sort of works (if I give up the scapegoat). Although I have trouble
that I have to copy the value from A to A1, I could have done that with
previous hierarchy and simply set B.low=3DC.low=3D10G.

But there can be no cousin (uncle) or more precisely it's the global
rest that we don't mind to affect.

I made a hasty argument (misinterpretting the constant outer reclaim
pressure). So that wasn't the fundamental difference.

The second part -- memory.min is subject to equal calculation as
memory.low. Do you find the scape goat preventing OOM in grand-parent
(or higher) subtree also a misfeature/artifact?

Thanks,
Michal

[1] Here I'm taking your/Tejun's assumption that in the stressful
situations it always boils down to IO, although I don't have any
quantitative arguments for that.
