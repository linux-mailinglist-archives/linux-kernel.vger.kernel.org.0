Um... maybe my poor English expressing ability to make you misunderstand.
In fact, I want to say that we should allow the user to allocate ALL supported
size of hugepages dynamically by default, so we need require ALL architectures
to set up ALL supported huge page sizes.

Great! I'm looking forward to your patches. I also have one or two other small
improvements, I hope to discuss with you after you finish these codes.

I get it, thanks :)
