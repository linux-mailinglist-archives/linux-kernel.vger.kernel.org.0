Note that rcu_irq_enter() and rcu_irq_exit() also contain value-returning
atomics, which imply full memory barriers.

One approach would be to define a synchronize_preempt_disable() that
waits only for pre-existing disabled-preemption regions (including
of course diabled-irq and NMI-handler regions.  Something like Steve
Rostedt's workqueue-baed schedule_on_each_cpu(ftrace_sync) implementation
might work.

There are of course some plusses and minuses:

+	Works on preempt-disable regions in idle-loop code without
	the need to invoke rcu_idle_exit() and rcu_idle_enter()..

+	Straightforward implementation.

-	Does not work on preempt-disable regions on offline CPUs.
	(I have no idea if this really matters.)

-	Schedules on idle CPUs, so usage needs to be restricted to
	avoid messing up energy-efficient systems.  (It should be
	just fine to use this for tracing.)

Thoughts?
