Right. We need to make a plan to replace unsigned long with u64 in the
clk framework and then figure out how to support whatever use-cases we
can with the extra 32-bits we get on the 32-bit unsigned long platforms.
I had a patch lying around that started to plumb u64 through the core
clock framework code, but I didn't pursue it because it didn't seem
necessary. I've seen some code for display PLLs that need to support
10GHz frequencies for display port too, so you're not alone here.=20

Some questions to get the discussion going:

 1. Do we need to use the clk framework to set these frequencies or can
 it be done via other means in whatever subsystem wants to program these
 frequencies, like a broadcast TV tuner subsystem or the IIO subsystem?

 2. If clk framework must handle these frequencies, does it need to be
 set through the clk consumer APIs or can we manage to set the rates on
 these clks via child dividers, muxes, etc. that have
 CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag? This might avoid changing the consumer API
 and be simpler to implement.

 3. What's the maximum frequency and the highest resolution we need to
 support? Maybe we just need to support GHz and not THz (10^12) and have
 a resolution of uHz (micro-Hertz)?

 4. Not really a question, but a goal. We should try to avoid a
 performance hit due to an increase in 64-bit math. If possible we can
 do things differently on different CPU architectures to achieve this or
 we can have the clk providers use different clk ops/flags to indicate
 the max range and precision they require.

Anyway, I'm not going to be working on this topic anytime soon but these
are my rough thoughts. I'm sure others on the list have thought about
this topic too so if you want to work on this then it would be good to
float an RFC that answers these questions.
