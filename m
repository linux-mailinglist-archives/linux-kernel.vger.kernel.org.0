Just to get a picture. What other situations are we talking about,
please?

oops_exit() is one candidate. The other callers seem to be working
in normal context.

This sounds familiar. I think that we did not consider it safe in the
end, see the commit 03fc7f9c99c1e7ae29 ("printk/nmi: Prevent deadlock
when accessing the main log buffer in NMI").

If the problem is only with Oops then the 2nd propose might be
acceptable. The system will either try to continue or it will end
up in panic() anyway.

Well, WARN() looks like an overkill, especially if there is only
one possible caller that prints the stack anyway. I would personally
do not print any message and do just:

	/*
	 * Prevent deadlock on logbuf_lock. It is safe only
	 * in panic() after smp_send_stop() and resetting
	 * the lock.
	 */
	if (in_nmi() && reason != KMSG_DUMP_PANIC)
		return;
