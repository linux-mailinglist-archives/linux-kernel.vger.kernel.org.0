A more complete oops report would have been better, e.g. if anyone was googling
it, to find this patch.

Also I was checking where else calculate_sizes() is called and found
order_store(). So if somebody changes (especially increases) the order,
shouldn't the reinitialization also be done?

This is even more nasty as it doesn't seem to require that no objects exist.
Also there is no synchronization against concurrent allocations/frees? Gasp.
