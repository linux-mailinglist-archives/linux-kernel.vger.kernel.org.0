You're hardly late; I expect replies to dribble in for a week.

What I'm trying to take advantage of here is constant propagation.

msecs_to_jiffies is zero cost (it's evaluated entirely at compile 
time) if its argument is a compile-time constant.  It's a function call
and a few instructions if its argument is variable.

msecs_to_jiffies(ORPHAN_SCAN_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT + prandom_u32_max(5000))
would be forced to use the expensive version.

The compiler does't know, but *I* know, that msecs_to_jiffies() is a 
linear function, and prandom_u32_max() is a sort-of linear function.

(It's a linear function for a given PRNG starting state, so each 
individual call is linear, but multiple calls mess things up.)

Modulo a bit of rounding, we have:

msecs_to_jiffies(a + b) = msecs_to_jiffies(a) + msecs_to_jiffies(b)
msecs_to_jiffies(a) * b = msecs_to_jiffies(a * b)
prandom_u32_max(a) * b = prandom_u32_max(a * b)
prandom_u32_max(msecs_to_jiffies(a)) = msecs_to_jiffies(prandom_u32_max(a))

By doing the addition in jiffies rather than milliseconds, we get the 
cheap code.  It's not a huge big deal, but it's definitely smaller and 
faster.

Admittedly, I happen to be using HZ = 300, which requires a multiply to 
convert, and makes the resultant random numbers slightly non-uniform.  
The default HZ = 250 makes it just a divide by 4, which is pretty simple.

(When HZ = 300, you get 1..3 ms -> 1 jiffy, 4..6 ms -> 2 jiffies, and
7..10 ms -> 3 jiffies.  Multiples of 3 are 33% more likely to be chosen.)

It just seems silly and wasteful to pick a random number between 0 and 
4999 (plus 30000), only to convert it to a random number between 0 and 
1249 (plus 7500).

And if HZ = 2000 ever happens, the timeout won't be artificially limited
to integer milliseconds.
