Frankly speaking I still think add_timer_on() is preferred here
because mod_timer() users will really need to be careful to make sure
they'll pin the timers correctly all the time, and I assume that's why
we've tried to find all the TIMER_PINNED users and tried to make sure
there's nothing wrong on using them during previous discussion (and
more than half of them do use add_timer_on() which seems to be good).
In all cases, I'll take your suggestion to drop the last sentence.

Thanks for reviewing this document patch.  I'll repost.
