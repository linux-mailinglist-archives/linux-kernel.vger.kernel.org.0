I think that the only maintainable solution is to call the console
drivers in a well defined context (kthread). We have finally opened
doors to do this change.

Using printk_deferred() or removing the problematic printk() is
a short term workaround. I am not going to block such patches.
But the final decision will be on maintainers of the affected subsystems.

Deferring console work should prevent the deadlocks. Another story
is allocating memory from console->write() callback. It makes the
console less reliable when there is a memory contention. Preventing
this would be very valuable.
