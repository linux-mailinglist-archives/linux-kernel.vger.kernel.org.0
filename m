For this, sure. Colleague Shaokun (cc'ed) provided me the metadata for 
these JSON additions, so when he returns from national vacation I can 
ask him to provide necessary tags.

Adding notes to JSONs would be painful unless the parser is updated to 
to filter them out. And, as I understand, the x86 JSONs are 
autogenerated, so that tooling would need to handle this also.

There is no per-arch JSON, and, in addition, I think that would be hard 
to formulate such formal rules.

As an alternative, how about just add a maintainers entry for reviewers 
per arch? As a start, I don't mind being added there for arm64:

--- a/MAINTAINERS
+++ b/MAINTAINERS
@@ -12767,6 +12767,10 @@ F:     arch/*/events/*
  F:     arch/*/events/*/*

+PERFORMANCE EVENTS SUBSYSTEM ARM64 PMU EVENTS
+R:     John Garry <john.garry@huawei.com>
+F:     tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/arm64
+

Patches per-arch should have some nod/tag from a member of the 
respective list. Or at very least be cc'ed :)

Thanks,
John
