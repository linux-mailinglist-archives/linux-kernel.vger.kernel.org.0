Please do look into it then. I think it already handles all cases.

In that case, I'm sure my patch series handle all the scenarios
correctly. Here's why:
1. For all the top level devices the patches you've reviewed already
show how it's handled correctly.
2. All other devices in the DT are by definition the child devices of
the top level devices and patch 6 handles those cases.

Hopefully this shows to you that all DT cases are handled correctly.

Any piece of code is going to "add complexity". It's a question of
benefits vs complexity. Also, I'm mostly reusing existing device links
API. The majority of the complexity is in parsing DT. The driver core
maintainers seem to be fine with adding sync_state() support for
device links (that is independent of DT).

What I'm doing IS the most generic solution instead of doing the same
work multiple times at a framework level. Also, for multi-function
devices, framework level solutions would be worse.

I'd actually say that your proposal is what's trying to paper over a
generic problem by saying it's specific to one or a few set of
resources. And it looks feasible to you because you haven't dove deep
into this issue.

I'll have to disagree on your claim. You are adding unnecessary
bootloader dependency when the kernel is completely capable of
handling this on its own. You are requiring explicit "gets" by
suppliers and then hoping all the consumers do the corresponding
"puts" to balance it out. Somehow the consumers need to know which
suppliers have parsed which bootloader input. And it's barely
scratching the surface of the problem.

You are assuming this has to do with just power when it can be clocks,
interconnects, etc. Why solve this repeated for each framework when
you can have a generic solution?

Also, while I understand what you mean by "get" it's not going to be
as simple as a reference count to keep the resource on. In reality
you'll need more complex handling. For example, having to keep a
voltage rail at or above X mV because one consumer might fail if the
voltage is < X mV. Or making sure a clock never goes about the
bootloader set frequency before all the consumer drivers are probed to
avoid overclocking one of the consumers. Trying to have this
explicitly coordinated across multiple drivers would be a nightmare.
It gets even more complicated with interconnects.

With my patch series, the consumers don't need to do anything. They
just probe as usual. The suppliers don't need to track or coordinate
with any consumers. For example, regulator suppliers just need to keep
the voltage rail at (or above) the level that the boot loader left it
on at and then apply the aggregated requests from their APIs once they
get the sync_state() callback. And it actually works -- tested for
regulators and clocks (and maybe even interconnects -- I forgot) in a
device I have.

Ofcourse Linux is used by more than just Android. And Android is just
an ARM64(32) distribution. But how many platforms do you have where a
module adds devices that are not part of DT (because I'm handling the
DT part fine -- see other emails)? How does that count compare to
millions of products that can use this feature? And I'm not breaking
any of the existing platforms that don't use DT either. So saying I
have to fix this for 100% of the use cases for Linux before I can
remove the roadblocks for a common ARM64 kernel that can run on any
ARM64 platform seems like an unreasonable position.
