I can see the confusion. The goal with this patch is to make it more 
clear which
macros and structures are for SCM interface from those which deal with 
the
implementation of how an SCM call is implemented with the smc 
instruction. It's
not presently clear that struct qcom_scm_response (for instance) is only
relevant in the context of legacy convention.

I choose the name "legacy" since only older firmwares use it and having
"scm_buffer_get_command_buffer" seems even more confusing to me! "SMCCC" 
was
chosen for lack of a better name.

Additionally, the concern with having qcom_scm_ prefix on these 
functions
(especially legacy_get_*_buffer()) is you get long function names which 
didn't
seem desirable. If the long names are preferable, I can update series 
with the
longer form of the names.
