Hmm. My impression is that this patch takes an existing so-so trick and make=
s it a bit weirder and a bit less broken but still quite hackish.

I suggest a different solution: add something like PTRACE_BPF: it resumes th=
e target and passes each event through a BPF program.  The BPF program can d=
ecide whether to ignore the event or trap.  Or log it!

Sadly, unprivileged eBPF may still be stalled, so you may have to fudge it w=
ith classic BPF, which is doable but more awkward and less powerful.
