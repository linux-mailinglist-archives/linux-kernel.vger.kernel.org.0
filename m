Hey Peter,

Thanks for your very detailed review.  it is deeply appreciated.  My
apologies for the style issues, I blindly trusted checkpatch.pl, when it
said it was ready for submission.

I'm not sure I get the suggestion here.  If I understand the code
correctly, once we do it one at a time, we need to queue_me() each futex
and then drop the hb lock, before going to the next one.  Once we go to
the next one, we need to call get_user_pages (and now copy_from_user),
both of which can sleep, and on return set the task state to
TASK_RUNNING.  This opens a window where we can wake up the task but it
is not in the right sleeping state, which from the comment in
futex_wait_queue_me(), seems problematic.  This is also the reason why I
wanted to split the key memory pin from the actual read in patch 1/2.

Did you consider this problem or is it not a problem for some reason?
What am I missing?
