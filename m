In case the controller supports multiple links, what's the encoding then?
in the MIPI DisCo spec there is a linkId field in the _ADR encoding that 
helps identify which link the Slave device is connected to

so it is actually required if you have a single Slave device? Or is it 
only required when you have more than 1 device of the same type?

FWIW in the MIPI DisCo spec we kept the instanceID as part of the _ADR, 
so it's implicitly mandatory (and ignored by the bus if there is only 
one device of the same time)

Isn't the MIPI encoding reported in the Dev_ID0..5 registers 0-based?

And now that I think of it, wouldn't it be simpler for everyone if we 
aligned on that MIPI DisCo public spec? e.g. you'd have one property 
with a 64-bit number that follows the MIPI spec. No special encoding 
necessary for device tree cases, your DT blob would use this:

soundwire@c2d0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,soundwire-v1.5.0"
	reg = <0x0c2d0000 0x2000>;

	spkr_left:wsa8810-left{
		compatible = "sdw0000100217201000"
	}

	spkr_right:wsa8810-right{
		compatible = "sdw0000100217201100"
	}
}

We could use parentheses if it makes people happier, but the information 
from the MIPI DisCo spec can be used as is, and provide a means for spec 
changes via reserved bits.
