Why would I print zeroes if there is no operand? The decoder logic
returns a -1 if it can't find a mod r/m byte, which causes the #GP
handler to not print any address at all. Or are you talking about some
weird instruction that takes an operand that is actually ignored, or
something weird like that?

Which is an argument for printing the address even if it is canonical,
as Ingo suggested, I guess.

In which case you'd probably usually see a canonical address in the
instruction's argument, which causes the error message to not appear
(in patch v2/v3) / to be different (in my current draft for patch v4).
And as Ingo said over in the other thread, even if the argument is not
directly the faulting address at all, it might still help with
figuring out what's going on.

But this is the #GP handler. Don't overlong instructions give you #UD instead?

The patch you're commenting on does that already; quoting the patch:

+       /* Bail out if insn_get_addr_ref() failed or we got a kernel address. */
+       if (addr_ref >= ~__VIRTUAL_MASK)
+               return;
+
+       /* Bail out if the entire operand is in the canonical user half. */
+       if (addr_ref + insn.opnd_bytes - 1 <= __VIRTUAL_MASK)
+               return;

But at Ingo's request, I'm planning to change that in the v4 patch;
see <https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191120111859.GA115930@gmail.com/>
and <https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAG48ez0Frp4-+xHZ=UhbHh0hC_h-1VtJfwHw=kDo6NahyMv1ig@mail.gmail.com/>.
