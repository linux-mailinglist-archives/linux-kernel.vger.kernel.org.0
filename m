There are several suggestions until now. Thanks, Folks!

For deactivating:

- MADV_COOL
- MADV_RECLAIM_LAZY
- MADV_DEACTIVATE
- MADV_COLD
- MADV_FREE_PRESERVE


For reclaiming:

- MADV_COLD
- MADV_RECLAIM_NOW
- MADV_RECLAIMING
- MADV_PAGEOUT
- MADV_DONTNEED_PRESERVE

It seems everybody doesn't like MADV_COLD so want to go with other.
For consisteny of view with other existing hints of madvise, -preserve
postfix suits well. However, originally, I don't like the naming FREE
vs DONTNEED from the beginning. They were easily confused.
I prefer PAGEOUT to RECLAIM since it's more likely to be nuance to
represent reclaim with memory pressure and is supposed to paged-in
if someone need it later. So, it imply PRESERVE.
If there is not strong against it, I want to go with MADV_COLD and
MADV_PAGEOUT.

Other opinion?
