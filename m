I find list_del() error in my implementation. When client closes
connection with server, stub driver calls stub_device_cleanup_urbs()
to free all the privs and urbs. stub_device_cleanup_urbs() takes
stub_priv from the lists calling stub_priv_pop() and calls
stub_free_priv_and_urb() to free priv and urbs. But the error occurs
when stub_free_priv_and_urb() tries to call list_del() to delete
stub priv from the list because it was already deleted from the
list in stub_priv_pop().

I modified stub_free_priv_and_urb() and stub_device_cleanup_urbs()
to support SG. In stub_device_cleanup_urbs(), the code is the same
as stub_free_priv_and_urb() except that it does not call list_del()
when freeing stub priv and urbs. So I removed the duplicated code
and make stub_device_cleanup_urbs() call stub_free_priv_and_urb()
to free stub priv and urbs. But when calling stub_free_priv_and_urb()
in stub_device_cleanup_urbs(), it should avoid calling list_del()
but it calls. I will fix it up and send v5.
