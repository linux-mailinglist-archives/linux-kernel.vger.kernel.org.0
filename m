The asterisks prepended to the quoted text currently get translated to
bullet points, which gets increasingly confusing the smaller your
screen is (when viewing the sphinx output, that is).

Convert the whole quote to a literal block.

 The code consists of a the high level handler in mm/memory-failure.c,
 a new page poison bit and various checks in the VM to handle poisoned
