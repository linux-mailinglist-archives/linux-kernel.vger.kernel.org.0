Subject: [PATCH v2 2/2] clk: qcom: gpucc: Add support for GX GDSC for SC7180

Most of the time the CPU should not be touching the GX domain on the
GPU except for a very special use case when the CPU needs to force the
GX headswitch off. Add the GX domain for that use case.  As part of
this add a dummy enable function for the GX gdsc to simulate success
so that the pm_runtime reference counting is correct.  This matches
what was done in sdm845 in commit 85a3d920d30a ("clk: qcom: Add a
dummy enable function for GX gdsc").

+ * defining a GX gdsc with a dummy enable function and a "default" disable
+ * function.
+ *
+ * This allows us to attach with genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_name() in the GPU
+ * driver. During power up, nothing will happen from the CPU (and the GMU will
+ * power up normally but during power down this will ensure that the GX domain
+ * is *really* off - this gives us a semi standard way of doing what we need.
