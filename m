Hmm, but all of those IOMMU instances must be driven by the same driver,
right, since bus_set_iommu() can only take one set of callbacks for a given
bus? In which case, removing the driver module effectively removes all
instances of the IOMMU for that bus and I think we're ok.

If we couple that with Joerg's suggestion to take a reference to the driver
module in add_device(), then I think that actually it's harmless to leave
the bus ops installed and the groups should be sorted too. It means it's
pretty difficult to unload the module, but that's probably not a bad thing.

I'll post a v2 shortly...

To be honest, I think we should be trying to move *away* from the bus-ops
abstraction rather than extending it. We already don't need it for DMA
domains on arm64, and I think it's really just a bit of a wart now because
iommu_domain_alloc() takes a 'struct bus_type *' as its argument.
