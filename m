I assume that this is mlock specific because the pagecache which has the
same problem is reclaimable and the problem tends to resolve itself
after some time.

Anyway, how big of a problem this really is? A lingering memcg is
certainly not nice but pages are usually not mlocked for ever. Or is
this a way to protect from an hostile actor?
