Locking issues typically lead to timing problems (race conditions), so
it might just be that the sequence or timing of calls changed between
kernel versions, enough to trigger the issue.

What's the reason it's not suggested? From my understanding, there
shouldn't be any dependency on hardware design here, it's just a
simple software optimization - we can pipeline other CPU operations
while the IOMMU is flushing the TLB.

Basically, right now:

CPU writes page tables 1
IOMMU flushes 1 | CPU busy waits
CPU writes page tables 2
IOMMU flushes 2 | CPU busy waits
CPU writes page tables 3
IOMMU flushes 3 | CPU busy waits
...

With my suggestion that could be:

CPU writes page tables 1 I
IOMMU flushes 1 | CPU writes page tables 2
IOMMU flushes 1 | CPU busy waits less time
IOMMU flushes 2 | CPU writes page tables 3
IOMMU flushes 2 | CPU busy waits less time
IOMMU flushes 3 | CPU busy waits

It reduces the time the CPU spends on busy waiting rather than doing
something useful. It also reduces the total time of maps and unmaps.

Actually, we can optimize even more. Please consider the case below.

CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x1000.
IOMMU flushes 0x1000 | CPU busy waits
CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x2000.
IOMMU flushes 0x2000 | CPU busy waits
CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x3000.
IOMMU flushes 0x3000 | CPU busy waits
CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x8000.
IOMMU flushes 0x8000 | CPU busy waits

However, depending on the way the hardware implements TLB flush, the
optimal sequence of operations could be:

CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x1000.
CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x2000.
CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x3000.
IOMMU flushes 0x1000-0x3000 | CPU writes PTE for IOVA 0x8000.
IOMMU flushes 0x1000-0x3000 | CPU busy waits remaining flush time.
IOMMU flushes 0x8000 | CPU busy waits.

What's the algorithmic complexity of the TLB flush operation on
MediaTek IOMMU? If N is the number of pages to flush, is it O(N), O(1)
or something else?

Best regards,
Tomasz
