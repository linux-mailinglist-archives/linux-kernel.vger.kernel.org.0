We have documented those here:

Documentation/features/sched/membarrier-sync-core/arch-support.txt

For instance, x86:

# * x86
#
# x86-32 uses IRET as return from interrupt, which takes care of the IPI.
# However, it uses both IRET and SYSEXIT to go back to user-space. The IRET
# instruction is core serializing, but not SYSEXIT.
#
# x86-64 uses IRET as return from interrupt, which takes care of the IPI.
# However, it can return to user-space through either SYSRETL (compat code),
# SYSRETQ, or IRET.
#
# Given that neither SYSRET{L,Q}, nor SYSEXIT, are core serializing, we rely
# instead on write_cr3() performed by switch_mm() to provide core serialization
# after changing the current mm, and deal with the special case of kthread ->
# uthread (temporarily keeping current mm into active_mm) by issuing a
# sync_core_before_usermode() in that specific case.

I've also made sure x86 switch_mm_irqs_off() has the following comment,
just in case someone too keen on optimizing away the CR3 write would
forget to look at arch-support.txt:

        /*
         * The membarrier system call requires a full memory barrier and
         * core serialization before returning to user-space, after
         * storing to rq->curr. Writing to CR3 provides that full
         * memory barrier and core serializing instruction.
         */

In the case of arm/arm64, they have no requirement on switch_mm():

# * arm/arm64
#
# Rely on implicit context synchronization as a result of exception return
# when returning from IPI handler, and when returning to user-space.


Thanks,

Mathieu
