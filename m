For display timings there is something similar.
Here the property is named native-mode and is a phandle to the
preferred timing.
And it is documented that if no native-mode is specified the first
timing in the tree is chosen.  
So a different concept than this.

I could not from your otherwise well-documented changelog see why you
wanted to go for an opauge integer and status rather than a phandle to
the active display.

The panel-id, if I get it right, is optional and the important part is
that the first panel with staus = "okay" is selected.
This would cover my usecase fine.
I have a target with four different displays and the bootloader
knows what display is used (based on gpio etc).
The bootloader (barebox in my case) uses a simple variant of the DT,
but reads in the DT used by the kernel and can modify the DT before
it is passed to the kernel.
