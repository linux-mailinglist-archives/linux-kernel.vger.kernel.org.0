Yeah, that's the approach we're heading towards with aspeed.

Part of the reason for why I wasn't 100% sure we wanted to move all
drivers over, is that most of drivers/soc has been for "soc glue
logic" code, not for the little SoC-specific drivers where we've
pushed hard to get out into their best-matching driver directories
instead.

Aspeed is an unusually "messy" SoC in that it has a handful of little
widgets used to communicate with the host (in its role as BMC), and
either we'd squint and put all of them in drivers/misc, or we could
pick them up in drivers/soc as we're now doing. Either way the code
will be in the kernel, and keeping it together might not be a bad
idea.

We might get more of a kitchen sink in drivers/soc over time with this
slight change in approach, but we've dealt with messes before and if
it happens, we'll clean it up when it gets too bad. Sometimes letting
it happen is the best way of seeing the bigger picture and not
over-engineer something upfront.

Yeah. I think that's fine in this case.

I've got some horror stories from botched rebases where merges ended
up containing actual code changes and that caused immense confusion,
but that's not the case here.

Yep, looks good -- thanks!

We'll follow up with patches for that, thanks for pointing it out.

I have to admit that most of my focus tends to be to check for new
errors, not whether everything still is built. Easy to automate, so
I'll poke around with it a bit.
