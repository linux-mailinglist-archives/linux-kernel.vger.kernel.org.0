You might think this would be adding runtime_suspend/runtime_resume
callbacks, but those also get called actually at runtime which is not
the goal here.  At runtime, these types of disks should rely on APST which
should calculate the appropriate latencies around the different power state=
s.

This code path is only applicable in the suspend to idle state, which /does=
/
call suspend/resume functions associated with dev_pm_ops.  There isn't
a dedicated function in there for use only in suspend to idle, which is
why pm_suspend_via_s2idle() needs to get called.

SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS normally sets the same function for suspend and
freeze (hibernate), so to avoid any changes to the hibernate case it seems
to me that there needs to be a new nvme_freeze() that calls into the existi=
ng
nvme_dev_disable for the freeze pm op and nvme_thaw() that calls into the
existing nvme_reset_ctrl for the thaw pm op.

Enterprise class NVMe devices that don't do APST - do they typically
have a non-zero value for ndev->ctrl.npss?

If not, they wouldn't enter this new codepath even if the server entered in=
to S2I.
