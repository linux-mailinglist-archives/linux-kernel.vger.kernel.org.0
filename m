Thanks for adding us.

Just a heads up in case you want to mess around with clang in the
future, I wrote a toolchain build script for ClangBuiltLinux to help
with the long compile times by cutting as much cruft as possible (and
it is self contained by default, won't install anything outside of the
repository).

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/tc-build

The slimmest working configuration for testing what you did would probably
be from the following command:

./build-llvm.py --build-stage1-only --projects clang --targets X86

Unfortunately, -Wimplicit-fallthrough does not work for C right now
(only C++), as pointed out by Nick on LLVM's bug tracker.

https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39382

This patch resolves that while adding support for the attribute.

https://reviews.llvm.org/D64838

Your example properly works when that patch is applied and
-Wimplicit-fallthrough is added to the list of flags.

../lib/test_module.c:24:2: warning: unannotated fall-through between switch labels [-Wimplicit-fallthrough]
        case 2:
        ^
../lib/test_module.c:24:2: note: insert '__attribute__((fallthrough));' to silence this warning
        case 2:
        ^
        __attribute__((fallthrough)); 
../lib/test_module.c:24:2: note: insert 'break;' to avoid fall-through
        case 2:
        ^
        break; 

Hopefully it can get merged soon. I am sure Nathan or Nick can speak
to further progress on that.

I was trying to follow along with this thread through the web interface
and kind of got lost, how does it not work? If I apply your compiler
attributes patch with D64838, I see fallthrough get expanded to
__attribute__((__fallthrough__)) by the preprocessor.

GCC's documentation says that -Wimplicit-fallthrough is equivalent to
-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 so it seems like just making that change would
be all that is needed to support Clang:

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wimplicit-fallthrough

Cheers,
Nathan
