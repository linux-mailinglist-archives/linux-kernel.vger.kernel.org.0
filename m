Ok, the code above does that today.

Agree!

Today, we never overwrite a user defined value that is larger than
that calculated by the code.  However, we will owerwrite a user defined
value if the code calculates a larger value.

I'm starting to think the best option is to NEVER overwrite a user defined
value.
