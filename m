Can it be done something like turning off searching for an idle core if the wakee
task is latency tolerant(more latency-nice)? We search for idle core to get faster
resource allocation, thus such tasks don't need to find idle core and can
directly jump to finding idle CPUs.
This can include sliding windows mechanism along, but as I commented previously, it
imposes task ping-pong problem as sliding window gets away from target_cpu. So maybe
we can first search the core with target_cpu and if no idle CPUs found then bail
to this sliding window mechanism.
Just an thought.

Best,
Parth
