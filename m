Greg, I am ready to take ownership. Juri the original author of this file
agreed and I have been reviewing this file since Juri first wrote it.
I am happy to submit a patch assuming maintainership for this file, was
just waiting to hear from you when I asked explicitly you and Juri in
last version of the patch when Will wanted someone from ARM to be reviewer
of this file at-least. I am happy to take over as reviewer or maintainer
which ever you prefer.

Sorry if I was not so clear in my earlier mail.
