Correct as you don't seem to provide clear answers, I am asking again
which patch implements the new fields added here, how difficult is it to
provide the *specific* patch which implements this so that I can compare
the implementation and see why this is needed and apply if fine!

But no you will not provide a clear answer and start ranting!

No you get asked specific question which you do not like and start off
on a tangent!

Again, which patch in the series does implement these new members!
