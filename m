gold is known to fail the kernel build. x32 vdso linking is not working
since years and just because it 'works' for some configurations and breaks
for no valid reasons even with those configurations is just not good
enough.

As there is obviously no priority for fixing gold to work proper with the
kernel, I'm not at all interested in these 'regression' reports and in odd
'fixes' which just end up reverting or modifying perfectly valid changes
without understanding the root cause, i.e. the most horrible engineering
principle: duct-taping.

TBH, I'm tired of it. We fail the build for clang if it does not support
asm gotos and the clang people are actively working on fixing it and we're
helping them as much as we can. The companies who used clang nevertheless
have been on their own for years and if someone wants to use gold then
nobody is preventing them from doing so. They can keep their duct-tape in
their own trees.
