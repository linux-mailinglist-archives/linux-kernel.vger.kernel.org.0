Paolo can maybe comment why.

...but even if BFQ wanted to try to change this, I think it's
impossible to fully close the race.  There is no locking between the
call to has_work() and dispatch_request() and there can be two (or
more) threads running the code at the same time.  Without some type of
locking I think it will always be possible for dispatch_request() to
return NULL.  Are we OK with code that works most of the time but
still has a race?  ...or did I misunderstand how this all works?

It might be slow, but correctness trumps speed, right?  I tried to do
this with a 2nd atomic and without the spinlock but I kept having a
hole one way or the other.  I ended up just trying to keep the
spinlock section as small as possible.

If you know of a way to get rid of the spinlock that still makes the
code correct, I'd be super interested!  :-)  I certainly won't claim
that it's impossible to do, only that I didn't manage to come up with
a way.
