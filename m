It looks like it's not -- I think we're just the first to realise this.

AFAICT x86's debugfs ptdump has the same issue if run conccurently with
memory hot remove. If 32-bit arm supported hot-remove, its ptdump code
would have the same issue.

The debugfs part is used intermittently by a few people working on the
arm64 kernel page tables. We use that both to sanity-check that kernel
page tables are created/updated correctly after changes to the arm64 mmu
code, and also to debug issues if/when we encounter issues that appear
to be the result of kernel page table corruption.

So while it's rare to need it, it's really useful to have when we do
need it, and I'd rather not remove it. I'd also rather that it didn't
have latent issues where we can accidentally crash the kernel when using
it, which is what this patch is addressing.

I'm not sure if that would help us here; IIUC pfn_to_online_page() alone
doesn't ensure that the page remains online. Is there a way to achieve
that other than get_online_mems()?

The big problem for the ptdump code is when tables are freed, since the
pages can be reused elsewhere (or hot-removed), causing the ptdump code
to explode.

Thanks,
Mark.
