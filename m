Unless I=E2=80=99ve misunderstood you, the problem is that the callback and t=
he caller are totally different subsystems. I can count the number of people=
 who know which tracepoints need RCU turned on in their callbacks without us=
ing any fingers (tglx and I are still at least a bit confused=E2=80=94 I=E2=80=
=99m not convinced *anyone* knows for sure).

I think we need some credible rule for which events need special handling in=
 their callbacks, and then we need to ensure that all subsystems that instal=
l callbacks, including BPF, follow the rule.  It should not be up to the aut=
hor of a BPF program to get this right.
