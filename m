I'm slightly confused by what you think is the best course of action here.

I can create a patch dropping the '_dumb' from drm_gem_dump_map_offset()
if that's the objection. Or do you want a helper function with two
callers (the 'dump' and the 'shmem' versions)?

mmap'ing an imported object isn't a problem as such. But rather than
going behind the exporter's back we would need to call dma_buf_mmap() to
ensure that the exporter can do whatever is necessary.

I could add a wrapper in drm_gem_shmem_helper, but I'm not sure what the
benefit of a wrapper here is?
