For example, return EBUSY from your ioctl?  That should work.  You could
also sleep for a jiffy or two to let things catch up in this BUSY (or
similar) case.  Or try three times, waiting a jiffy between each try,
and return EBUSY if all three tries failed.

Or just keep it simple and return EBUSY on the first try.  ;-)

All of this assumes that this ioctl is the cause of the overload, which
during early boot seems to me to be a safe assumption.
