Okay, I'll add this as a separate patch to the series and put you as
author. That is if you want me to tie this check to this usecase that
proves its usefulness. Otherwise it can stand on its own as well if
you want to submit it separately.

In regards to the ratio computation for frequency invariance where this
plays a role, I'll do a check and bail out if the ratio is 0, which I'm
ashamed to not have added before :).

Thanks,
Ionela.
