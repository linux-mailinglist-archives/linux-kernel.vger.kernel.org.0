 Intel AMT Applications
-======================
-
-	1) Intel Local Management Service (Intel LMS)
-
-	   Applications running locally on the platform communicate with Intel AMT Release
-	   2.0 and later releases in the same way that network applications do via SOAP
-	   over HTTP (deprecated starting with Release 6.0) or with WS-Management over
-	   SOAP over HTTP. This means that some Intel AMT features can be accessed from a
-	   local application using the same network interface as a remote application
-	   communicating with Intel AMT over the network.
-
-	   When a local application sends a message addressed to the local Intel AMT host
-	   name, the Intel LMS, which listens for traffic directed to the host name,
-	   intercepts the message and routes it to the Intel MEI.
-	   For more information:
-	   http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide
-	   Under "About Intel AMT" => "Local Access"
-
-	   For downloading Intel LMS:
-	   http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-the-latest-intel-amt-open-source-drivers/
-
-	   The Intel LMS opens a connection using the Intel MEI driver to the Intel LMS
-	   firmware feature using a defined UUID and then communicates with the feature
-	   using a protocol called Intel AMT Port Forwarding Protocol (Intel APF protocol).
-	   The protocol is used to maintain multiple sessions with Intel AMT from a
-	   single application.
-
-	   See the protocol specification in the Intel AMT Software Development Kit (SDK)

-	   => "Description of the Intel AMT Port Forwarding (APF) Protocol"
-
-	2) Intel AMT Remote configuration using a Local Agent
-
-	   A Local Agent enables IT personnel to configure Intel AMT out-of-the-box
-	   without requiring installing additional data to enable setup. The remote
-	   configuration process may involve an ISV-developed remote configuration
-	   agent that runs on the host.
