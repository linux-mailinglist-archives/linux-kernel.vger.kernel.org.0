Hi,
I'm an ocean away from my test rig at the moment, won't be back home till
after August 10. Maybe I can set up something here as I have one OM13588.
Will try later today. Also, switching from an sama5d2_xplained to an Acme
Systems Arietta which is at91sam9g25 based to run Linux. So it won't be
exactly the same hardware.
