I used to have one but it's been so long since anyone tried to even
think about defending the removal of functions that are not used in the
kernel tree anymore, that I can't seem to find it anymore :)

Christoph is completely correct here, if it isn't in the tree, it
doesn't matter.  We have made this "formal" statement again and again
over the years, starting with the old "stable api nonsense" document
that is in the kernel tree itself.

And he is also correct in that we talked about this specific issue, in
detail, at the maintainers summit last year, see lwn.net for the details
if you somehow missed it then.

thanks,
