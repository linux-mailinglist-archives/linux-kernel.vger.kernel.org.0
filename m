Yes, that's the point. Enforcing that dts files contain what the
binding docs say.

DT is not the only way to instantiate drivers. A driver can create a
platform device itself which will then instantiate a 2nd driver.

Presumably the DSP needs to be booted, resources enabled, and firmware
loaded before IPC will work. The DSP driver controlling the lifetime
of the IPC driver is the right way to manage the dependencies.

SC is system controller? Maybe I missed it, but I don't think system
controllers usually have 2 nodes. You only have the communications
interface exposed as the SC provides services to Linux and Linux
doesn't manage the SC resources.
