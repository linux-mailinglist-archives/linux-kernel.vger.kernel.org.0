Yes we did - I commented on this.

LIBC itself tries to dynamic load stuff internally.

It is beyond our control and it claims that it will work only on EXACTLY 
the same version of libc library as the one used for static link.

So you get a not-exactly static binary which is not properly moveable 
between systems.

This is specifically in the name resolution, etc parts of libc which all 
of: pcap, vector, vde, etc rely on.

Another alternative is to turn off static specifically for those.

Further to this - any properly written piece of networking code which 
uses the newer functions for name/service resolution will have the same 
problem. You can be static only if you do everything "manually" the old way.
