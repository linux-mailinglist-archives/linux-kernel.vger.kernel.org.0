Dear Stephan von Krawczynski;

Universal City Studios Inc v Reimerdes, piece of shit.

"[The court] reasoned that Ferret consumers who used the Ferret as a 
plug-in to the Real Player altered the Real Player user interface by 
adding the Snap search button or replacing it with the Stream box search 
engine button. The court concluded that the plaintiff raised sufficently 
serious questions going to the merits of its claims to warrant an 
injunction pending trial"

Want to violate the linux kernel copyright, you fucking piece of shit? 
Yes you do. Yes modifying the running kernel with violating pieces is 
copyright infringement, you fucking piece of shit. Yes you should be 
sued. Just as Open Source Security (Grsecurity) should be sued for their 
violations (of section 4 and 6 of the linux kernel copyright license 
(they're also violating the GCC copyrights too)).

Will they be sued? Will you be sued? No: Linux copyright holders are 
scared little wageslave worker bees. They aren't going to sue you; 
sorry. Why are you even announcing you intent to violate the copyright? 
Why even give these dogs such intellectual deference?

I wish OpenSourceSecurity would be sued. I wish you would be sued. But 
linux WERKIN MAHN wage slave piece of shit idiots won't do it: I hate 
them much more than I hate the violators. Complete Dogs. They could move 
from strenght to strenght, from victory to victory; but they're scared 
for their "JEHRB"s. I have to say: white men are pathetic scum. If Linux 
was built by others there would rightfully be lawsuits.
