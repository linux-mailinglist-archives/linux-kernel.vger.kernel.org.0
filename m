Note that calling getrandom(0) "too early" is not something people do
on purpose. It happens by accident, i.e. because we live in a world
where SSH or HTTPS or so is run in the initrd already, and in a world
where booting sometimes can be very very fast. So even if you write a
program and you think "this stuff should run late I'll just
getrandom(0)" it might not actually be that case IRL because people
deploy it a slightly bit differently than you initially thought in a
slightly differently equipped system with other runtime behaviour...
