This is how MADV_FREE has been implemented, yes. See f7ad2a6cb9f7 ("mm:
move MADV_FREE pages into LRU_INACTIVE_FILE list") for the
justification.

You are again making assumptions without giving any actual real
examples. Reconstructing MADV_FREE pages cost can differ a lot. This
really depends on the specific usecase. Moving pages to the tail of LRU
would make them the primary candidate for the reclaim with a strange
LIFO semantic. Adding them to the head might be not the universal win
but it will at least provide a reasonable FIFO semantic. I also find
it much more easier to reason about MADV_FREE as an inactive cache.
