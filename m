I though the same. But then I found the following in
Documentation/admin-guide/serial-console.rst

  "If no console device is specified, the first device found capable of
  acting as a system console will be used. At this time, the system
  first looks for a VGA card and then for a serial port. So if you don't
  have a VGA card in your system the first serial port will automatically
  become the console."


In addition, there is the "documentation" how systemd handles serial
console and login prompts, see
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/serial-console.html


I agree that the current behavior is wrong. I really would like
to change it. But the result would be that some users will not
get login prompt after a kernel update. I am afraid that we are
blocked by the "do not break userspace" rule.

Best Regards,
Petr
