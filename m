+Software Sinks
+--------------
+
+The Memory Storage Unit (MSU) driver provides an in-kernel API for
+drivers to register themselves as software sinks for the trace data.
+Such drivers can further export the data via other devices, such as
+USB device controllers or network cards.
+
+The API has two main parts::
+ - notifying the software sink that a particular window is full, and
+   "locking" that window, that is, making it unavailable for the trace
+   collection; when this happens, the MSU driver will automatically
+   switch to the next window in the buffer if it is unlocked, or stop
+   the trace capture if it's not;
+ - tracking the "locked" state of windows and providing a way for the
+   software sink driver to notify the MSU driver when a window is
+   unlocked and can be used again to collect trace data.
+
+An example sink driver, msu-sink illustrates the implementation of a
+software sink. Functionally, it simply unlocks windows as soon as they
+are full, keeping the MSU running in a circular buffer mode. Unlike the
+"multi" mode, it will fill out all the windows in the buffer as opposed
+to just the first one. It can be enabled by writing "sink" to the "mode"
+file (assuming msu-sink.ko is loaded).
