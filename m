Thanks for humoring me here...

The part about the source page's page->mapping pointer being *copied*
to the ZONE_DEVICE struct page is particularly interesting, and belongs
maybe even in a comment (if not already there). Definitely at least in
the commit description, for now.

Well here, I worry, because subpage !=3D tail page, right? subpage is a
strange variable name, and here it is used to record the page that
corresponds to *each* mapping that is found during the reverse page
mapping walk.

And that makes me suspect that if there were more than one of these
found (which is unlikely, given the light testing that we have available
so far, I realize), then there could possibly be a problem with the fix,
yes?

Yeah, him and me both. :)

That's  b7a523109fb5c9d2d6dd3ffc1fa38a4f48c6f842 in linux.git, now.
