Aren't we looking for a rewrite from non-global to global here (disable
KPTI where we would otherwise have it), which we don't currently have
code for?

That is probably a good idea but I think that runs too late to affect
the early mappings, they're done based on kaslr_requires_kpti() well
before we start secondaries.  My first pass not having paged everything
back in yet is that there needs to be command line parsing in
kaslr_requires_kpti() but as things stand the command line isn't
actually ready then...
