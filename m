This seems like a very specific corner case, depending on fsuid!=0 for an 
euid=0 process, along with a whitelist policy for perf arguments. It would 
be a great way to escalate to root via a bug in an executed app or via a 
wrapper misconfiguration.

It also adds complexity to kernel credential handling -- it's yet another 
thing to consider when trying to reason about this.

Have you considered the example security configuration in 
Documentation/admin-guide/perf-security.rst ?

What are some other examples of programs that could utilize this scheme?
