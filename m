Are you sure they aren't already there under /sys/firmware/acpi/?  I
thought all tables and methods were exported there with no need to do
anything special.

What makes these attributes "special" from any other ACPI method?

How can any userspace be looking for anything that hasn't been submitted
before?  That's nothing to worry about, we don't have to support things
like that :)

Look at /sys/firmware/acpi/ first please.
