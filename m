There are a total of four I2S controllers on the A83T. Currently three of them
are listed in the dtsi file, which are _not_ the one shown in the user manual.
The one shown is the fourth one, which is the TDM controller.

It's not like we haven't seen this before. IIRC the A64 also had two variants
of the I2S interface. The one coupled with the audio codec was different from
the others.

I'll sync up with Maxime on this.

Since they haven't listed the I2S block in the user manual, so that is what we
have to go by.

The TDM section in the user manual only lists the block at 0x1c23000. The memory
map says DAUDIO-[012] for addresses 0x1c22000, 0x1c22400, 0x1c22800, and TDM for
address 0x1c23000. One would assume this meant these are somewhat different.

I understand that.

Tested on the H3, correct?

I'll take a look. IIRC it worked with the old layout, with the two registers
swapped, playing standard 48 KHz / 16 bit audio when I added supported for
the A83T. Then again maybe the stars were perfectly aligned. At the very least
we could separate A83T and H3 as you suggested.
