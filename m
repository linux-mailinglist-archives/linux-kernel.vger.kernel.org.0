Based on my testing if queues (IRQ) are not disabled, NVMe controller won’t  
be quiesced.
Symptoms can be high power drain or system freeze.

I can check with vendors whether this also necessary under Windows.

I am not sure I get your idea. Does this “no-op” suspend happen in NVMe  
driver or PM core?

I was told that Windows doesn’t use runtime D3, APST is used exclusively.
