So I had not considered alternatives because they're typically ran once
at boot (and module load) and never seen again. That would make them
just part of loading new text.

But you mentioned wanting to run them at hotplug time... which is more
'interresting'.

The general distinction is between new text mappings and changing them
once they exist.

In general a text mapping is large and doesn't change (much). Once you
get an event it exist you can copy it out at your convenience, all you
really need to make sure of it that it doesn't dissapear before you've
completed your copy.

OTOH dynamic text like jump_labels can happen quite frequently and we
cannot wait for all observers to have observed/copied the new state
before we allow changing it again -- ie. we need a buffered event.

So we don't want to stick whole new text things into a buffer (a module
might be larger than the buffer) but we cannot be lazy with text
updates.

That is, yes it sucks, but these are two different cases.

All we need to ensure is that the breakpoint is visible before the
event. That way we know that before the event we have the old
instruction, after the event we have the new instruction, and any
ambiguity must be resolved with exception packets.

That is, if there is concurrency, the trace buffer will be 'flushed' by
the exception. If there is no concurrency, we don't care and can assume
old/new depending on timestamps relative to the event.
