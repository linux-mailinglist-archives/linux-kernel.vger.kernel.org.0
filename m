Hello,

I see that you have already sent v6, for future iterations can you
please wait until the conversation on the previous version has been
settled?

I'm still replying to your replies to v5, and hence you should hold off
sending v6 until we get some kind of conclusion/agreement.

I would word it along these lines:

"Host administrators can cause memory pressure in blkback by attaching
a large number of block devices and inducing I/O."

While this is useful, it's kind of too verbose IMO. If you need to do
this kind of performance comparisons I would recommend using ministat
(available at least on Debian and FreeBSD) in order to plot the
results and give the std deviation and statistical difference given a
confidence level.

The output of ministat can be pasted in the commit message, since it's
a text based tool.

I'm afraid that just adding a note about this concerns is not enough.

We should make sure that this change doesn't regress the current
performance of fast storage backends, and hence I have to ask you to
test with null_blk or a fast storage and provide the figures.

Getting a proper solution would be my preference, in the mean time I
guess it's fine to accept such a bodge, as it's pretty small and
non-intrusive.

Thanks, Roger.
