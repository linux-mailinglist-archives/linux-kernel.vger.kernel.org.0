Heh, so I've typed up about five different responses to this comment.  In
doing so, I think I've convinced myself that ->may_mprotect() is
unnecessary.  Rther than hook mprotect(), simply update the VM_MAY* flags
during mmap(), with all bits cleared if there isn't an associated enclave
page.  IIRC, the need to add ->may_protect() came about when we were
exploring more dynamic interplay between SGX and LSMs.

No, the enclave page protections are enforced regardless of LSM policy,
and in v2 those protections are immutable.  Yes, the explicit enclave
page protection bits are being added primarily for LSMs, but they don't
impact functionality other than at the security_enclave_load() touchpoint.
