I have validated & checked w/ designer that NANDs device just need CS# 
line
toggling and don't care of CLE/WE#/RE#. That is raw NAND controller 
sending
a command nand_status_op() or nand_power_down_op() will exit the deep 
power down too. The first command(just CS# line toggling) to NAND device 
in deep power down mode will not be recognized. We may publish the 
application notes or update the datasheet later.

thanks & best regards,
Mason
