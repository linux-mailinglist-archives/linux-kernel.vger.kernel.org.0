Agreed on this part.

I am sorry but I got lost in the above description and I cannot really
make much sense from the code either. Let me try to outline the way how
I think about this.

Say we have a pfn to hwpoison. We have effectivelly three possibilities
- page is poisoned already - done nothing to do
- page is managed by the buddy allocator - excavate from there
- page is in use

The last category is the most interesting one. There are essentially
three classes of pages
- freeable
- migrateable
- others

We cannot do really much about the last one, right? Do we mark them
HWPoison anyway?
Freeable should be simply marked HWPoison and freed.
For all those migrateable, we simply do migrate and mark HWPoison.

Now the main question is how to handle HWPoison page when it is freed
- aka last reference is dropped. The main question is whether the last
reference is ever dropped. If yes then the free_pages_prepare should
never release it to the allocator (some compound destructors would have
to special case as well, e.g. hugetlb would have to hand over to the
allocator rather than a pool). If not then the page would be lingering
potentially with some state bound to it (e.g. memcg charge).  So I
suspect you want the former.
