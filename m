Correct.

Let me comment on that, because there is actually two cases that are
relevant here to be covered.

1. After the SDIO card has been system suspended, sdio_run_irqs()
doesn't call the ->ack_sdio_irq() callback, as to prevents the host
driver from re-enabling the SDIO irq (acking). This is to avoid the
host from re-signalling the same SDIO IRQ over and over again when the
SDIO card is suspended.

2. Dealing with the SDIO IRQ bit-mask when the host driver system
suspends/resumes. This is host specific, but a common behavior is that
the driver can't allow any IRQ to be managed by its IRQ handler in a
suspended state. This is because the device (MMC controller) may be
put into a low power state (no clocks enabled, register context is
lost and not accessible, etc), which makes the device non-functional.

Exactly. Other host drivers do this as well.

Although note that the host device gets system suspended after the
sdio card device, so there is still a window when an SDIO IRQ can be
signaled. This is covered by 1) above.

Also note that, in general it also depends on whether there is wakeup
IRQ configured and how that wakeup might be handled. This is another
story, which doesn't seem relevant for dw_mmc, at least not at this
point.

Kind regards
Uffe
