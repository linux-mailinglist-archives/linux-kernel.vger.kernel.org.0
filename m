I didn't ask you to hope.  I instead asked you what tell me what would
actually happen.  ;-)

You could actually try this by randomly grouping the patches in -rcu
(say, placing every third patch into one of three groups), generating
separate pull requests, and then merging the pull requests together.
Then you wouldn't have to hope.  You could instead look at it in (say)
gitk after the pieces were put together.

And there are more questions.  For example, how would this affect testing
given issues involving both RCU and other pieces of the kernel?

Sounds like we might need to discuss this face to face.
