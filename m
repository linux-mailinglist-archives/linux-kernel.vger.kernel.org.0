I guess this is urgent? I'm lost why Andy can't apply the patch and
merge it up to Linus. I don't maintain this driver here, and even if
there's a cross tree dependency I don't understand why a base of
v5.1-rc1 is limiting abilities to apply patches.

I'd think that if an "immutable branch" was all that was required you
could 'git checkout 7c2e07130090ae001a97a6b65597830d6815e93e' and then
apply the patch there and merge it all up into the PDx86 tree. In the
end, when sending the PR to Linus the already merged changes won't show
up in the diff because it's all been merged already on the other side.

Either way, I'm going to send off the clk PR real soon so this may need
to wait until after the merge window, or if it's really urgent I could
send a fixes branch before the merge window closes next week.
