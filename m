The lack of a DRCONF_MEM_RESERVED check in add_by_index() and
remove_by_index() might be a mistake.  If I understand the PAPR
correctly, when DRCONF_MEM_RESERVED is set for an LMB the operating
system isn't allowed to touch it.  The LMB could become available for
use later if the platform clears the bit, but if it's set it's
no good.

DRCONF_MEM_ASSIGNED checks are not present in
dlpar_memory_add_by_index() and dlpar_memory_remove_by_index() but
they are done at the top of dlpar_add_lmb() and lmb_is_removable(),
so the checks do happen in those paths.

The exclusion of rollback in the remove_by_index() path makes sense,
as there are only N=1 possible elements where the operation can fail.
Doing the marking/unmarking for rollback in the N=1 case is harmless
though.  If the removal fails for the given LMB we never call
drmem_mark_reserved() to indicate that we need to re-add it.  The
rollback loop then finds no marked LMBs and does no work.

drmgr eventually uses dlpar_memory_*_by_count() when you give it a
count of LMBs with the '-q' flag, e.g.:

# drmgr -c mem -a -q 10

drmgr eventually uses dlpar_memory_*_by_index() when you give it a
particular DRC, e.g.:

# drmgr -c mem -a -s <some drc number>

QEMU hotplug uses dlpar_memory_*_by_ic().

Sure.

Maybe there are less ambitious ways to start out.
