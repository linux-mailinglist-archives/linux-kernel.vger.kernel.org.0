Yes, it would. My point was rather if pidfds mean something more than
identity at some point then we just need to make sure that you can only
get a getsockopt+pidfd_open(pid, 0) equivalent pidfd from it, i.e. one
without additional abilities (see below).

As a concrete example, think of it as root calling clone3() with e.g. an
additional flag PIDFD_GETFD which would stash the creds of the calling
process (in this example root) and when pidfd_getfd() is passed such a
pidfd it would use the creds of root instead of the calling threads
cred. This would e.g. allow a process to delegate the ability to
retrieve file descriptors from another task but nothing else.
