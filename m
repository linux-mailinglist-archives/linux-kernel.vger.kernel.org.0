Hey,

The changes looks good overall, however a few areas would
look even better after a bit of formatting.

The API methods text under this section could be converted
to sub-headings (^^^) for improved readability.

rcu_dereference() sub-section under `Section 2` has 2
footnotes which could be linked using
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#footnotes

This could also be converted to a subheading alongside 5A.

A cross-reference link, like, `Back to Quick Quiz #n` could be
created which would link to `Quick Quiz #n` in the text. I
noticed other .rst have this feature so this could be a nice
addition.

Further, many words were emphasized in txt format,
example, -toy-, -before- etc. These could be italicized/
bold to comply with reST formatting.

Thanks a lot
