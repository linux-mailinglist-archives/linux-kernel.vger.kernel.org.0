So I like the idea here, but I have a couple of nits and one larger
thought...

By Documentation/process/license-rules.rst, that should be "GPL-2.0"; the
absence of a "+" means "only".

Some people object to the introduction of unnecessary non-ASCII text, and
this one would count; can we take the © symbol out?

Now for the bigger thought...  I wonder if what we really want to do is
to adopt some form of the kerneldoc format for sysctl knobs?  That would
allow the documentation to be placed in the source right next to the
table entries, which might, in the optimistic world I inhabit, help
developers to keep them up to date.

That, of course, is more work than what you've done; until somebody feels
inspired to do that work I'll happily accept a tweaked version of this
script.  But one can always dream...

Thanks,

jon
