I see, ok, then we need to clear the flag in the hub thread.

But to me it looks like this patch could cause a small race risk in the successful
device initiated resume cases.

If the hub thread, i.e. the get_port_status() function, notices the U0 state before
the interrupt handler, i.e. handle_port_status() function, then port_remote_wakeup
flag is cleared in the hub thread and the wakeup notification is never called from
handle_port_status().

Would it be enough to just check for (port_remote_wakeup flag && !PORT_CONNECT) in the hub thread?
USB3 PORT_CONNECT bit is lost in most error cases.
