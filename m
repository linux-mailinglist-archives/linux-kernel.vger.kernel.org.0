The common philosophy is to cache as much as possible. And MADV_FREE
pages are a kind of cache as well. If the target node is short on memory
then those will be reclaimed as a cache so a pro-active freeing sounds
counter productive as you do not have any idea whether that cache is
going to be used in future. In other words you are not going to free a
clean page cache if you want to use that memory as a migration target
right? So you should make a clear case about why MADV_FREE cache is less
important than the clean page cache and ideally have a good
justification backed by real workloads.
