How about "(unsigned int)node >= nr_node_ids", this is suggested
by Peter, it checks the case where the node id set by fw is bigger
or equal than nr_node_ids, and still handle the < 0 case, which
includes NUMA_NO_NODE.

Maybe define a macro like below to do that in order to do
the node checking consistently through kernel:

#define numa_node_valid(node)	((unsigned int)(node) < nr_node_ids)

From below, if the __GFP_THISNODE is set, the fallback is not performed.
For node_to_cpumask_map() case, maybe we can return the cpumask that is
on the node of cpu_to_node(raw_smp_processor_id()) for NUMA_NO_NODE,
because the current cpu does belong to a node, and the node does have at
least one cpu, which is the cpu is calling the node_to_cpumask_map().

Make any sense?

/*
 * Allocate pages, preferring the node given as nid. The node must be valid and
 * online. For more general interface, see alloc_pages_node().
 */
static inline struct page *
__alloc_pages_node(int nid, gfp_t gfp_mask, unsigned int order)
{
	VM_BUG_ON(nid < 0 || nid >= MAX_NUMNODES);
	VM_WARN_ON((gfp_mask & __GFP_THISNODE) && !node_online(nid));

	return __alloc_pages(gfp_mask, order, nid);
}
