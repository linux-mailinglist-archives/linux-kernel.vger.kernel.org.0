There are only two users of this function: on_each_cpu_cond which passes
cpu_online_mask, and native_flush_tlb_others from arch/x86/mm/tlb.c. But
I haven't followed all callers to native_flush_tlb_others to determine if
they are only passing in online CPUs.

Whilst trying to understand the code I couldn't help but notice that the
behaviour changes depending on the ability of memory allocation at the
time. This seemed odd. And of course there may be future callers of this
function that for some strange reason do pass in offline CPUs. (Maybe this
is OK and it's something they shouldn't be doing).

I felt that this function should be consistent and document the behaviour
via the @mask doc like some of the other functions in the file.

Does this prevent racing with a CPU going offline? I guess this prevents
the warning at the expense of a lock - but is only beneficial in the
unlikely path. (In the likely path this prevents new CPUs going offline
but we don't care because we don't WARN if they aren't they when we
attempt to call functions).

At least this is my limited understanding.

Thanks,
