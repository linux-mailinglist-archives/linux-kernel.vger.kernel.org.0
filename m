The real question, I guess, is: is there anything else that depends on the
current format of those files?  That could make reformatting them harder.

Otherwise it seems like Jani's fieldlist idea might have some potential.
We could consider a *really* simple preprocessing step if we really wanted
("prepend a colon on relevant lines and join with the following line if
need be") to keep the current format nearly unchanged.
