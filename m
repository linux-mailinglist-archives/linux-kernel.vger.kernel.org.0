Exactly, many things happen before and during the console
registration. There might already be (are) several messages when
new consoles are registered.

Now, people register more different consoles for different purpose.
For example, one is shown on a display, another can be stored by
an external device. It makes sense to show all messages on
all interfaces.

It can cause duplicated messages because there is no support to match
proper console with the early one. The current console registration
code somehow works only with one early console.
