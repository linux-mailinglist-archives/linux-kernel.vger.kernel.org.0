Chris from Cypress has replied privately to me because of some
email issues, with the request to relay the information he

Note Chris later send me some clarification on this point:

Chris, if I understand you correctly then the plan would result in the Cypress
maintained firmwares in linux-firmware being in sync (being the same versions
but with a more generic CLM) with the firmwares Cypress releases as part of
their SDK; and the first time we would see this in sync. release of Cypress
maintained firmwares would be around June. Correct?

This sounds very good to me.

I do have one question though, you describe the firmware as consisting of
3 parts: The actual firmware, the Country Locale Matrix and the NVRAM.

Currently linux-firmware contains firmwares with a generic CLM embedded
in them. But AFAIK the nvram-s are device-model/project specific (more so
then the CLM-s I believe) and normally the nvram is actual part of the
device and read by the kernel driver?  The one exception to this is the
nvram files for some SDIO boards. Recent kernels have code to load
the nvram files for these SDIO boards using a device-model specific
name and the linux-firmware repository contains community contributed
NVRAM files for various device-models. Would this change with the
new firmware versions ?

Regards,

Hans
