Subject: [PATCH v3] doc:lock: remove reference to clever use of read-write lock
Date:   Sun,  8 Sep 2019 08:29:01 +0200

Remove the clever example about read-write lock because this type of
lock is not reccomended anymore (according to the very same document).
So there is no reason to teach cleaver things that people should not do.

-Note that you can be clever with read-write locks and interrupts. For
-example, if you know that the interrupt only ever gets a read-lock, then
-you can use a non-irq version of read locks everywhere - because they
-don't block on each other (and thus there is no dead-lock wrt interrupts.
-But when you do the write-lock, you have to use the irq-safe version.

-For an example of being clever with rw-locks, see the "waitqueue_lock"
-handling in kernel/sched/core.c - nothing ever _changes_ a wait-queue from
-within an interrupt, they only read the queue in order to know whom to
-wake up. So read-locks are safe (which is good: they are very common
-indeed), while write-locks need to protect themselves against interrupts.
