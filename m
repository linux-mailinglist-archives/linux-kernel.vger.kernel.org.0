<nit picking>

While socket is optional, its probably a good idea to include the node 
in the example even if the result is the same. That is because at least 
on arm64 the DT clusters=sockets decision had performance implications 
for larger systems.

Assuring the socket information is correct is helpful by itself to avoid 
having to explain why a single socket machine is displaying some other 
value in lscpu.
