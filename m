The main issue was that there isn't anything pointing to the
linux-distros policies. The current text outlines a few of them ("add
[vs]", and "there should be an embargo period"), but it effectively just
gives out the linux-distros mailing address and tells the reporter to
contact it.

Why would removing the explicit linux-distros email encourage people to
send reports to it?

I also don't understand what you mean by "there isn't a separate
linux-distros wiki"? There is one, and I want to point the reporter
there.

To be fair, the Tue-Thu comment is listed in the section describing how
to do coordination with linux-distros, and linux-distros don't have a
Tue-Thu policy. If it's a security@kernel.org policy then let's list it
elsewhere.

If you feel that there is a consensus around Tue-Thu let's just add it
to the linux-distros policy wiki, there's no point in listing random
policies from that wiki.
