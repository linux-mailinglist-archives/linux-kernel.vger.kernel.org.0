I guess I should have put a warning into that task that step one is
designing the interface. Here's the fundamental thoughts:

- The _only_ thing we can hotplug after drm_dev_register() is a
  drm_connector. That's an interesting use-case, but atm not really
  supported by the vkms codebase. So we can't just enable/disable
  writeback like this. We also can't change _anything_ else in the drm
  driver like this.

- The other bit we want is support multiple vkms instances, to simulate
  multi-gpus and fun stuff like that.

- Therefore vkms configs should be at the drm_device level, so a
  directory under configfs/vkms/ represents an entire device.

- We need a special config item to control
  drm_dev_register/drm_dev_unregister. While a drm_device is registers,
  all other config items need to fail if userspace tries to change them.
  Maybe this should be a top-level "enable" property.

- Every time enable goes from 0 -> 1 we need to create a completely new
  vkms instance. The old one might still be around, waiting for the last
  few references to disappear.

- enable going from 1 -> 0 needs to be treated like a physical hotunplug,
  i.e. not drm_dev_unregister but drm_dev_unplug. We also need to annotate
  all the vkms code with drm_dev_enter/exit() as the kerneldoc of
  drm_dev_unplug explains.

- rmdir should be treated like enable going from 1 -> 0. Or maybe we
  should disable enable every going from 1 -> 0, would propably simplify
  everything.

- The initial instance created at module load also neeeds to be removable
  like this.

Once we have all this, then can we start to convert driver module options
over to configs and add cool features. But lots of infrastructure needed
first.

Also, we probably want some nasty testcases which races an rmdir in
configfs against userspace still doing ioctl calls against vkms. This is
ideal for validation the hotunplug infrastructure we have in drm.

An alternative is adding connector hotplugging. But I think before we do
that we need to have support for more crtc and more connectors as static
module options. So maybe not a good starting point for configfs.

The above text should probably be added to the vkms.rst todo item ...
