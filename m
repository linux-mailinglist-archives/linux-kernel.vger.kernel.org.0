Thanks for the info, indeed (keep) using a custom curve could be an
option.

I'm learning about the corresponding user space component of Chrome OS
as we speak. It looks like it's possible to specify the minimum
brightness level to use, which should do the trick, also making the OS
aware of the exponential nature of the backlight levels might help.
