This is _one_ of the usecases of the parent dev. We are also using it to manage
the runtime PM operations of the physical device (pcie) when the MHI stack goes
into respective states. For instance,

```
        if (MHI_PM_IN_SUSPEND_STATE(mhi_cntrl->pm_state)) {
                mhi_cntrl->runtime_get(mhi_cntrl);
                mhi_cntrl->runtime_put(mhi_cntrl);
        }
```

These runtime_put() and runtime_get() are the callbacks to be provided by the
controller drivers for managing its runtime PM states.

Also, the MHI devices for the channels will be created later on after the
controller probe, so at that time we need this parent dev to set the MHI device
parent:

```
struct mhi_device *mhi_alloc_device(struct mhi_controller *mhi_cntrl)
{
...
dev->parent = mhi_cntrl->dev;
...
```

Hence, having the parent dev pointer really helps.
