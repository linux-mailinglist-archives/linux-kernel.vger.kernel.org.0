This is not an option for Mark and I agree with him as we are faking
the reality: the two devices we want to virtually concatenate may be
two physically different devices. Binding them as one is lying.

This is something that is gonna happen too, it is called "dual
parallel".

I honestly don't see how this is different as solution 2/? In one case
we describe the partition concatenation in one subnode as a "link", in
the other we create a separate node to describe the link. Are you
strongly opposed as solution 2/? From a pure conceptual point of view,
is it really different than 3/?
 

Thanks,
