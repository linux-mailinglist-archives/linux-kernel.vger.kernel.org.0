Think about following example.

Assume that the size of inactive list for file page is 100.

1. start the new page, A, and access to A happens
2. 50 inactive pages are reclaimed due to 50 new pages
3. second access to A happens
4. 50 inactive pages are reclaimed due to 50 new pages
5. 100 inactive pages are reclaimed due to 100 new pages

If A is:
unmapped page: the page is activated at #3 and lives after #5
mapped page: the page reference is checked at #4 and re-attached
to the inactive list with PageReferenced() but is eventually reclaimed at #=
5

Even they are referenced by the same pattern, mapped page is reclaimed
but unmapped isn't. This is, what I said before, the disadvantage of
the mapped page than unmapped page. My guess is that to mitigate this
disadvantage on mapped file page, VM_EXEC test is needed since
VM_EXEC is the most important case for mapped file page.

Thanks.
