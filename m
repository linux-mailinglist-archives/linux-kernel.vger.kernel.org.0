I keep expecting a v3 so I have not dug into all the patches in detail. However, I've 
been working with them from Vincent's tree while they were under development so I thought 
I'd add some results.

The workload is a test our perf team came up with to illustrate the issues we were seeing
with imbalance in the presence of group scheduling. 

On a 4-numa X 20 cpu system (smt on) we run a 76 thread lu.C benchmark from the NAS Parallel 
suite. And at the same time run 2 stress cpu burn processes.  The GROUP test puts the 
benchmark and the stress processes each in its own cgroup.  The NORMAL case puts them all 
in the first cgroup.  The results show first the average number of threads of each type 
running on each of the numa nodes based on sampling taken during the run.  This is followed
by the lu.C benchmark results. There are 3 runs of GROUP and 2 runs of NORMAL shown.

I had initially tracked this down to two issues. The first was picking the wrong
group in find_busiest_group due to using the average load. The second was in 
fix_small_imbalance(). The "load" of the lu.C tasks was so low it often failed 
to move anything even when it did find a group that was overloaded (nr_running 
> width). I have two small patches which fix this but since Vincent was embarking
on a re-work which also addressed this I dropped them.

We've also run a series of performance tests we use to check for regressions and 
did not find any bad results on our workloads and systems.

So...
