But it *did* make sense intuitively!

They could be folded together or part folded together but I did not see
much value in that. I felt that keeping them seperate both preserved the
development history and acted as a historical reference on why using a
spare CPU can be hazardous. I do not believe it is a bisection hazard
as performance is roughly equivalent before and after the series (so
far at least). LKP might trip up on it and if so, we'll simply ask for
confirmation that patch 6 fixes it.
