It will be the common path; you'll start with a single huge fragment.

Remember, 1 allocator is better than 2.

There will be; imagine you have a size-6 fragment and request a size-5,
then we'll have to split off one. But one is too short to encode on the
free lists.

Suppose you tag them with -2, then on free of the size-5, we can check
if curr+size+1 is -2 and reunite.

First-fit or best-fit would result in lots of that, hence my suggestion
to use worst-fit if you can't find an exact match.
