Yes agreed, the HWLOCK_RAW and HWLOCK_IN_ATOMIC cases are unprotected. I
am still trying to understand better the usecase to see if the same lock
is being multiplexed for different protection contexts, or if all of
them are protecting the same context.

Just the semantics if we were to support single user vs multiple users
on Linux-side to even get a handle. Your point is that this may be moot
since we have protection anyway other than the raw cases. But we need to
be able to have the same API work across all cases.

So far, it had mostly been that there would be one user on Linux
competing with other equivalent peer entities on different processors.
It is not common to have multiple users since these protection schemes
are usually needed only at the lowest levels of a stack, so the
exclusive handle stuff had been sufficient.

Yeah, they are meant to be complimentary usage, though I doubt we will
ever have any realistic users for the generic API if we haven't had a
usage so far. I had posted a concept of reserved locks long back [1] to
keep away certain locks from the generic requestor, but dropped it since
we did not have an actual use-case needing it.
