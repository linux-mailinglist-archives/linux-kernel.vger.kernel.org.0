You mean remove it? But it's still needed by breakpoint code during all the event
lifecycle (init, destroy and anytime in-between).

I wish we could use event->ctx->task instead but on pmu::init() there is no ctx yet (we could pass
the task in parameter though) and on event->destroy() it's TASK_TOMBSTONE and retrieving the task
at that time would be non trivial.
