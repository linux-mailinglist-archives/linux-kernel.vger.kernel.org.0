Okay sure. What is about vmalloc space being PUD aligned and how that is
problematic here ? Could you please give some details. Just being curious.

Hmm. I assume that it will take care of dual 32 bit entry updates on arm
platform through various helper functions as Russel had mentioned earlier.
After we create page table with p?d_alloc() functions and pick an entry at
each page table level.

mm_alloc() seems like a comprehensive helper to allocate and initialize a
mm_struct. But could we use mm_init() with 'current' in the driver context or we
need to create a dummy task_struct for this purpose. Some initial tests show that
p?d_alloc() and p?d_free() at each level with a fixed virtual address gives p?d_t
entries required at various page table level to test upon.

In generic MM ? IIUC except ioremap mapping all other PUD handling for kernel virtual
range is platform specific. All the helpers used in the function pud_basic_tests() are
part of THP and used in mm/huge_memory.c
