Aaah... memory overhead. Thanks for pointing it out.

BEFORE

devm_clk_get()
  -> devres_alloc(devm_clk_release, sizeof(*ptr), GFP_KERNEL);
     allocates space for a struct devres + a pointer

struct devres {
	struct devres_node		node;
	/*
	 * Some archs want to perform DMA into kmalloc caches
	 * and need a guaranteed alignment larger than
	 * the alignment of a 64-bit integer.
	 * Thus we use ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN here and get exactly the same
	 * buffer alignment as if it was allocated by plain kmalloc().
	 */
	u8 __aligned(ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN) data[];
};

Not sure what it means for a flexible array member to be X-aligned...

(Since the field's address depends on the start address, which is only
determined at run-time...)

For example, on arm64, ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN appears to be 128 (sometimes).

/*
 * Memory returned by kmalloc() may be used for DMA, so we must make
 * sure that all such allocations are cache aligned. Otherwise,
 * unrelated code may cause parts of the buffer to be read into the
 * cache before the transfer is done, causing old data to be seen by
 * the CPU.
 */
#define ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN	(128)


Unless the strict alignment is also imposed on kmalloc?

So basically, a struct devres starts on a multiple-of-128 address,
first the devres_node member, then padding to the next 128, then the
data member?


/*
 * Some archs want to perform DMA into kmalloc caches and need a guaranteed
 * alignment larger than the alignment of a 64-bit integer.
 * Setting ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN in arch headers allows that.
 */
#if defined(ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN) && ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN > 8
#define ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN
#define KMALLOC_MIN_SIZE ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN
#define KMALLOC_SHIFT_LOW ilog2(ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN)
#else
#define ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN __alignof__(unsigned long long)
#endif


A devres_node boils down to 2 object pointers + 1 function pointer.

Are there architectures supported by Linux where a function pointer
is not the same size as an object pointer? (ia64 maybe?)



OK, I will give this patch some more thought.

But I need to ask: what is the rationale for the devm_add_action API?

Regards.
