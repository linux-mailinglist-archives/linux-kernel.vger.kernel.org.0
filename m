There's no one right answer to that question, folks have different
preferences.  My general rule of thumb is to cc everyone on all patches
unless the series is obnoxiously large *and* isolated to a specific part
of the kernel.  The idea being that people are more likely to be annoyed
if they can't find all patches in a relatively small series (this case)
than they are about receiving a mail or two that they don't care about.

At a minimum I would cc everyone involved on the cover letter, and cc the
relevant mailing lists on all patches.  Sending everyone the cover letter
provides people a quick overview of the patches they didn't receive, as
well as a starting point if they want to find those patches.  Cc'ing the
mailing list(s) can make it even easier to find the patches.  The cover
letter is also a good place to explain why you didn't cc everyone on all
patches (or vice versa).

Also, the cover letter should have the shortlog and overall diffstats.
'git format-patch --cover-letter' will do the work for you.
