We can look to improve that later on. This is complex enough and I kept
some features (like 4 byte minimum) out of this series to keep the
complexity down. I believe there are some archs that require 64bit
aligned access for 64 bit words and pointers. And the retstack
structure still has longs on it. If we need to adapt to making sure we
are aligned, I rather keep that complexity out for now.

That said, I just did a git grep HAVE_64BIT_ALIGNED_ACCESS and only
found the kconfig where it is defined and the ring buffer code that
deals with it. We recently removed a bunch of archs, and it could very
well be that this requirement no longer exists.

Regardless, I've been testing this code quite heavily, and changing the
stack from moving up to moving down already put me behind. I'd like to
pull this code into linux-next soon. Converting to ints can be done for
the release after we get this in.

Thanks for reviewing!
