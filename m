It's been a few years since I looked at the block layer, but isn't
this used to hold requests that were taken from the blk_mq_ctx,  but
couldn't be dispatched because the queue was full?

Available cpus where this hctx can run.

Maybe "the request queue this hctx belongs to"

Hmm, i think this needs clarification.

That's not really useful, since it is stating what the code does.  It
would be interesting to say why this is needed, i.e. to re-run the queue
and dispatch requests if the queue was full in the previous attempt.
