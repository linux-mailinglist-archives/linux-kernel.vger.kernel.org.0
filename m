Well.  Can you look at what intel-iommu does right now so that we can
sort that out first?

The prime example I had in mind is sata_nv.c.  This first does
a

	dma_set_mask_and_coherent(&pdev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(32));

and does a dma_alloc_coherent for buffers that have "legacy" descriptors.
Then does a

	dma_set_mask_and_coherent(&pdev->dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(64));

and allocates the other coherent buffers than can be 64-bit capable.
and then actually overrides the streaming dma mask to 32-bit if
there is an ATAPI device attached for which it has some limitations,
or otherwise keeps the 64-bit mask in a somewhat odd way.  But
this device actually can't be used with intel IOMMU as it is integrted
into the nforce chipsets.

But looking through this mess I'm tempted to agree with you that if
anyone is messing with the mask to first set it to 32-bit and then
back they can live with the default domain and iommu overhead..

Yes, that actually is my main worry.  The "upgrading" from dma_iommu_ops
to direct / NULL is pretty easy and clean, it is the other way that is
a mess.

I was hoping to get rid of dma_dummy_ops once we've killed off the last
leftovers of allowing DMA with a NULL dma_mask or *dma_mask and just
reject all DMA operations in that case.

So maybe we should massage intel-iommu toward that first.  Let me and Lu
know what makes sense to improve.
