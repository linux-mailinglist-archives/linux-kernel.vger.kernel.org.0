My expectation is that pr_flush() would wait only until the current
message appears on all consoles. It will not wait for messages that
would get added later.

It is true that I have never seen anyone checking the return value.
On the other hand, it is a minor detail. And I would prefer to stay
compatible with the userland printf() as much as possible.

Yeah, but it seems to be the only dictionary writer. There were doubts
(during the meeting) whether anyone was actually using the information.

Hmm, it seems that journalctl is able to filer device specific
information, for example, I get:

$> journalctl _KERNEL_DEVICE=+usb:2-1
-- Logs begin at Tue 2019-08-13 09:00:03 CEST, end at Mon 2019-09-16 12:32:58 CEST. --
Aug 13 09:00:04 linux-qszd kernel: usb 2-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci-pci

One question is if anyone is using this filtering. Simple grep is
enough. Another question is whether it really needs to get passed
this way.

Best Regards,
Petr
