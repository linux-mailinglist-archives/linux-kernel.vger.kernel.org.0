We need a lot more changes before one kernel build can work for all
platforms. At least until then, I think we need this. Lot less chance
of breaking existing platforms before all the missing pieces are
created.

Or we can have a command line to enable this for platforms that want
to use it and have it default off.

Yeah, but the rest of the file seems to be under this. So I'm not
touching that. I can probably move this function further down (close
to platform populate) if you want that.

Not in this patch.

Regulators are the other big missing piece that I'm aware of now but
they need a lot of discussion (see email from David and my reply).

Not sure what other resources are shared where they can be "turned
off" and cause devices set up at boot to fail. For example, I don't
think interrupts need functional dependency tracking because they
aren't really turned off by consumer 1 in a way that breaks things for
consumer 2. Just masked and the consumer 2 can unmask and use it once
it probes.

I'm only intimately familiar with clocks, interconnects and regulators
(to some extent). I'm open to adding other supplier categories in
future patches as I educate myself of those or if other people want to
add support for more categories.
