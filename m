There's no guaranteed no-fail semantics for GFP flags (obviously besides
__GFP_NOFAIL), GFP_KERNEL can fail and GFP_NOFS is unlikely to fail for
order below costly allocations. This depends on the allocator internals
and has never been an API-level guarantee AFAIK. There's ongoing to work
to relax the allocator constraints and allow to fail in more cases
(like for GFP_NOFS).

All data write paths must consider what happens under memory pressure,
because the reason to write the data could be started by an allocation
that can get free memory by writing dirty data. So it's kind of implied
here.
