+1

We also need to add VDE (wonder if anyone still uses that).

We will need to add XDP when I finish it. If memory servces me right, 
libelf or libbpf has the same lovely features as NSS.

This is not just NSS - it is creeping in with a lot of new libraries. 
Sometimes the libc guys fix that. For example, librt was like that when 
I started working on epoll and vector IO.

Sometimes (as in the NSS case) they don't. So the static build 
containing those will be broken and we are better off making it conflict 
for those options.
