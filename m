On my side, I understood from the spec that addr/S are always used
whatever the granularity, hence the above suggestion.

As a comparison, for PASID based IOTLB invalidation, it is clearly
stated that if G matches PASID selective invalidation, address field is
ignored. This is not written that way for PASID-based device TLB inv.
