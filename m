Please define "full" for me.  Please please don't tell me you are just
using a truncated version of the PCI address.  I thought we got rid of
all of that nonsense 10 years ago...

Then what exactly _IS_ this number, if not the PCI address?

Something made up to look almost like a PCI address, but not quite?
Somethine else?

Again, fake PCI address?

"Invalid"?  Why?  Why not just refer to the 0:0 device, as that's the
bus "root" address (or whatever it's called, I can't remember PCI stuff
all that well...)

> Should we use the format in option 2?

What could userspace do with a -1 -1 address?
