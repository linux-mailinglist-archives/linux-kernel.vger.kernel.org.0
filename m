Looks like here is some information missing.

Could you not also remove runnable_load_avg from struct sched_avg and
put it into the struct cfs_rq directly. The signal has nothing to to
with PELT anymore and se don't have to carry it. You only need it for
the root cfs_rq's but it's at least better than having it still for all
se's as well.

There are a couple of comments in fair.c referring to this cfs_rq as the
root cfs_rq, rather the cpu cfs_rq. IMHO, easier to read if we stick to
one name (root_cfs_rq vs. cpu_cfs_rq).
