I've only found one extra location in kernel/sched/ that seems like it
wants to use is_kthread(), included below. I can send it out separately
after this gets merged.

Regarding sched/fair.c, I am quite convinced all of the p->mm checks are
genuine (as in they don't care if it's a kthread or not) - those are all
about NUMA balancing. Maybe Rik/Mel can correct me if I'm wrong.
