Agree that it is more important.

Then I think that this approach is fatally flawed in the current implementation.

A device can be added by a module that is loaded.  In that case the device
was not present at late boot when the suppliers may turn off their resources.
(I am assuming the details since I have not reviewed the patches later in
the series that implement this part.)

Am I missing something?

If I am wrong, then I'll have more comments for your review replies for
patches 2 and 3.
