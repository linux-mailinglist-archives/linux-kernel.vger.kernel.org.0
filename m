The comment is about addressing someone who must run an "AMU" enabled
kernel ("one kernel") on a system with potentially "broken firmware",
where there is no option to use the system as you mention above,
the firmware could panic. How common is the "broken firmware" ?
Right now there is no way to ensure "firmware" is sane and if
someone detects that firmware is broken, there is no way to
disable the AMU if they are running a standard distro kernel.
A kernel parameter could prevent the AMU capability from
being detected on a broken system and thus make it usable
(without the AMU of course). Now, if the "broken firmware"
is extremely rare, we could simply ignore this case and
ignore the suggestion.
