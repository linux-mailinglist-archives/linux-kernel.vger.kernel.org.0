I saw something similar but observed that it depended on whether the
worker tasks got spread wide or not which partially came down to luck.
The question is if it's possible to pick a point where we spread wide
and can recover quickly enough when tasks need to remain close without
knowledge of the future. Putting a balancing limit on tasks that
recently woke would be one option but that could also cause persistent
improper balancing for tasks that wake frequently.

I'll continue thinking about it but whatever chance there is of
improving it while keeping CPU balancing, NUMA balancing and wake affine
consistent with each other, I think there is no chance with the
inconsistent logic used in the vanilla code :(
