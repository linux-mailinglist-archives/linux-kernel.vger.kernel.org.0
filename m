Good catch.

We should only call khugepaged_adjust_min_free_kbytes from the 'true'
block of this if statement in init_per_zone_wmark_min.

	if (new_min_free_kbytes > user_min_free_kbytes) {
		min_free_kbytes = new_min_free_kbytes;
		if (min_free_kbytes < 128)
			min_free_kbytes = 128;
		if (min_free_kbytes > 65536)
			min_free_kbytes = 65536;
	} else {
		pr_warn("min_free_kbytes is not updated to %d because user defined value %d is preferred\n",
				new_min_free_kbytes, user_min_free_kbytes);
	}

In the existing code, a hotplug event will cause min_free_kbytes to overwrite
the user defined value if the new value is greater.  However, you will get
the warning message if the user defined value is greater.  I am not sure if
this is the 'desired/expected' behavior?  We print a warning if the user value
takes precedence over our calculated value.  However, we do not print a message
if we overwrite the user defined value.  That doesn't seem right!

Moving the call to khugepaged_adjust_min_free_kbytes as described above
would avoid the THP adjustment unless we were going to overwrite the
user defined value.  Now, I am not sure overwriting the user defined value
as is done today is actually the correct thing to do.

Thoughts?
Perhaps we should never overwrite a user defined value?
