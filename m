It's not just about preserving the value. Sometimes it's about stack space.
Here's the trade-offs for static variables within a function:

Advantages of static variables within a function (compared to non-static
variables, also within a function):
-----------------------------------

* Doesn't use any of the scarce kernel stack space
* Preserves values (not always necessarily and advantage)

Disadvantages:
-----------------------------------

* Removes basic thread safety: multiple threads can no longer independently
   call the function without getting interaction, and generally that means
   data corruption.

So here, I suspect that the original motivation was probably to conserve stack
space, and the author likely observed that there was no concurrency to worry
about: the function was only being called by one thread at a time.  Given those
constraints (which I haven't confirmed just yet, btw), a static function variable
fits well.

Not completely:

a) First of all, "instead of memset every time" is a misconception, because
    there is still a memset happening every time with {0}. It's just that the
    compiler silently writes that code for you, and you don't see it on the
    screen. But it's still there.

b) Switching away from a static to an on-stack variable requires that you first
    verify that stack space is not an issue. Or, if you determine that this
    function needs the per-thread isolation that a non-static variable provides,
    then you can switch to either an on-stack variable, or a *alloc() function.
