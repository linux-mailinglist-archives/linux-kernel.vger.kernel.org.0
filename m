Thanks for doing this conversion!  A number of my comments from the FUSE
patch apply here as well:

- Copy the maintainer

- Update MAINTAINERS

- Limit use of markup

- Consider a move to the admin guide.  It's less obvious here, though,
  because the information about the structure of the filesystem itself
  arguably does not belong there.  A better place, honestly, might be as a
  DOC block in the driver source itself, but that would need to be run past
  the maintainer.

A few other minor comments below.

This has become a very long line; it will be more readable if you break

Here too.  This should be something like:

  .. note::
      ``iocharset=utf8`` is not recommended. If unsure, you should consider
      the utf8 option instead.

A paragraph like that suggests that this information might be a wee bit out
of date - even if VFAT hasn't been changing much.  It might be worth asking
the maintainer for an opinion on how current things are and maybe putting
in a warning if it's truly obsolete.

Too many colons, just say "filesystem::".  There's a number of these.

I'll stop here, that's enough to work on for now.
