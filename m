It looks like you need to consolidate the prototypes of
bus_find_device() and class_find_device() in the first place, so all
of the changes this depends one need to go into one series and through
the Greg's tree.

Then, you need the new helpers to be defined on top of that and I
would introduce them in another patch series once the first step above
has been completed.

Finally, some code in multiple places needs to be changed to use the
new helpers and that can be done in many smaller steps with individual
changes going in through the respective subsystem trees of theirs.
