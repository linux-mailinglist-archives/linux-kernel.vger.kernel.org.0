Thanks for looking, but I'm not entirely sure how to parse your answer :-)

In LinuxBoot, we compile Linux into a UEFI driver and load it in
FLASH. It's started by the UEFI driver scheduler, a.k.a DxeCore. In
this case, Linux is both a bootloader (for the Linux or other kernel
it will boot) and Linux is also the thing booted by UEFI. As I
mentioned, we want to avoid writing a UEFI driver just to tell Linux
where to find the initramfs. Further, we want to be able to boot this
kernel and have it use an initramfs provided by a different bootloader
(pxeboot, for example). This flexibility is proving very useful for
companies deploying LinuxBoot today.

I got the idea of using initrd= because u-boot is able to pass that
option to the ARM kernel and the ARM kernel will process it: see,
e.g., the usage in arch/arm/configs/acs5k_defconfig.

Are you saying initrd is reserved for a bootloader to produce it or
consume it? It's certainly not either on ARM: it is in some cases
included in a compiled-in command line, and used by the kernel, just
as we are doing in this patch. The kernel build process produces it,
and the kernel consumes it. All this functionality is there, and all
this patch does it bring it into the x86 kernel with this 6 line
patch.

If, in spite of this usage on ARM, you'd still not rather see a
corresponding usage on x86, how do we get the effect we need here?
Again, we don't want to write UEFI drivers, but we would like some
minimal way to communicate to the kernel where an initramfs is in
memory; and, further, we want it to be the lowest priority option, so
we easily override it. Suggestions on how to do this are welcome.
