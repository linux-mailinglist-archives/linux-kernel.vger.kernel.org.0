This should work for some cases, but kernel doc (core-api/ioctl.rst) says it's
better to avoid bitfield completely. I understand it's possible to extend this
ioctl with flags and capability, even we can define if flags = A, then given 
capability = definition B, if flags = C, then capbaility definition is D, to
maximum the usage for extension, but it may make this interface very very
complicated to users. This should be the same reason why you didn't put irq
info into capability directly. Another reason is, in my understanding, it
choices ioctl to expose irq info becasue user must use ioctl to set irq, for
other capabilities which doesn't use device file, then some sysfs may be enough
for their own functions.

Thanks
