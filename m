Thanks Doug.

Agree, a simple check won't help here.

From above discussions, summarizing out 3 items that gets impacted when using rpmh_start/end_transaction().

1. rpmh_write_async() becomes of little use since drivers may need to wait for rpmh_flush() to finish
if caches becomes dirty in between.
2. It creates more pressure on WAKE TCS when there is no dedicated ACTIVE TCS. Transactions are delayed
if rpmh_flush() is in progress holding the locks and new request comes in to send Active only data.
3. rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_idle() needs locking if ANY cpu can be calling this, this may require reordering of
locks / increase the time for which locks are held during rpmh transactions. On downstream variant we don't
have locking in this since in OSI, only last CPU is invoking it and it is the only one invoking this function.

Given above impact this approach seem not so simple as i though of earlier. i have alternate solution which
uses cpu_pm_notifications() and invokes rpmh_flush() for non-OSI targets. This approach should not impact
above 3 items.

I will soon post out v14 with this, testing in progress.

No, it won't work out this way. if we want to test with zero active case, need to pick up [2].

[2] also need follow up fixes to work. This change is also in my to do
list to get merged. I will include a change in v14 series at the end, it can help test this series
for zero active tcs as well.

Note that it doesn't have any dependency with this series and current series can get merged
without [2].

There are multiple SoCs having zero active TCSes in downstream code. So we can not remove it.

As i said above we need [2] plus some fixes to have zero active TCS working fine on upstream driver.
