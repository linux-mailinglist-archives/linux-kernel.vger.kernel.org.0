You started from making code simple argument. But in case of we make the code
simple in this single place, the rest of code, which are the many places, will
become wrapped over huge helpers, which make the readability worse IMO.

After we have implemented a reliable sections order in lds file, we may use
it for a long time without remembering the way they are organized. But in case
of we introduce huge helpers, we always will bump into them during analyzing
of difficult asynchronous code, and these helpers size will overflow internal
buffers in our heads just by their excess symbols.

My opinion is to better make some less beautiful thing in a single synchronous place,
than to distribute the redundancy over all the code (especially, when it is asynchronous).
