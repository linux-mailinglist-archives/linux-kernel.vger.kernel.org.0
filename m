Right. If I see a diffstat that doesn't match, I just look at what a
non-merged diffstat would have looked like, and if that matches I know
what happened.

There are other reasons why diffstats won't match, of course. Like me
just having merged part of the same commits from another source (or
multiple trees applying the same patch). So it's not _just_ due to
multiple merge bases that the mis-match can happen.

Yup.

Well, warning for it would be fairly simple. Giving the "right" result
isn't simple, though, since the merge might need manual fixup to
succeed.

The warning you can check yourself: just do

    git merge-base --all upstream mybranch

and if you get more than one result, you know you are in the situation
where a diff from the merge base might not work (it *might* work, but
probably won't).

You can play around with it yourself, of course. Look at the
git-request-puill.sh script, it says something like this:

  merge_base=$(git merge-base $baserev $headrev) ||
  die "fatal: No commits in common between $base and $head"

and you could add something like

  all_merge_bases="$(git merge-base --all $baserev $headrev)"

and then add a warning if "all_merge_bases" doesn't match "merge_base".
