Yes, it was kinda actual for the case of unavailable RPM.

Anyways, /I think/ variant like this should have been more preferred:

if (!pm_runtime_enabled(&pdev->dev))
	tegra210_i2s_runtime_suspend(&pdev->dev);
else
	pm_runtime_disable(&pdev->dev);

There is no real harm today, but:

1. I'd prefer to be very careful with RPM in general, based on
   previous experience.

2. It should be a bug if device isn't RPM-suspended during
   of driver's removal. Thus the real problem needs to be fixed
   rather than worked around.
