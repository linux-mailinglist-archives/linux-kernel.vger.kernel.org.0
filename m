#foo-cells is not how many of something, but how many u32 parameters a
'foos' consumer property has. But seems like that's what you meant
based on the example.

We'd want to be more consistent in the naming, but seems reasonable.
One of the challenges with timers is selecting which timer is used for
what function. This helps as you can know if a timer is used for input
capture or not. One issue will be is having '#input-capture-cells'
enough to decide that, or does one have to walk the DT and find all
the 'timer-input-capture' properties (shouldn't be a lot)? You could
also want to use input capture, but not describe the connection in DT.

Another thought is should it be just 'timers' to cover both input
capture and output compare with those being selected with flags (like
GPIO).

My other question is just what are some real examples of devices
needing to describe this connection. Timers have had input capture
forever, but I've rarely seen it used. Output compare even less so.
