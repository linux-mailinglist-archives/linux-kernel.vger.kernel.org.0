Subject: [PATCH V3] perf/x86: Consider pinned events for group validation
Date:   Tue, 29 Oct 2019 08:42:01 -0700

From: Kan Liang <kan.liang@linux.intel.com>

perf stat -M metrics relies on weak groups to reject unschedulable
groups and run them as non-groups.
This uses the group validation code in the kernel. Unfortunately
that code doesn't take pinned events, such as the NMI watchdog, into
account. So some groups can pass validation, but then later still
never schedule.

For example,

 $echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
 $perf stat -M Page_Walks_Utilization

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

     <not counted>      itlb_misses.walk_pending
(0.00%)
     <not counted>      dtlb_load_misses.walk_pending
(0.00%)
     <not counted>      dtlb_store_misses.walk_pending
(0.00%)
     <not counted>      ept.walk_pending
(0.00%)
     <not counted>      cycles
(0.00%)

       1.176613558 seconds time elapsed

Current pinned events are always scheduled first. So the new group must
can be scheduled together with current pinned events. Otherwise, it will
never get a chance to be scheduled later.
The trick is to pretend the current pinned events as part of the new
group, and insert them into the fake_cpuc.
The simulation result will tell if they can be scheduled successfully.
The fake_cpuc never touch event state. The current pinned events will
not be impacted.
Disabling interrupts to prevent the events in current CPU's cpuc going
away and getting freed.

It won't catch all possible cases that cannot be scheduled, such as
events pinned differently on different CPUs, or complicated constraints.
The validation is based on current environment. It doesn't help on the
case, which first create a group and then a pinned event, either.
But for the most common case, the NMI watchdog interacting with the
current perf metrics, it is strong enough.

After applying the patch,

 $echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
 $ perf stat -M Page_Walks_Utilization

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

         2,491,910      itlb_misses.walk_pending  #      0.0
Page_Walks_Utilization   (79.94%)
        13,630,942      dtlb_load_misses.walk_pending
(80.02%)
           207,255      dtlb_store_misses.walk_pending
(80.04%)
                 0      ept.walk_pending
(80.04%)
       236,204,924      cycles

Changes since V3:
- Update comments (preemption is disabled as well)

The V2 still only check current CPU's cpuc. Because I think we cannot
prevent the cpuc in other CPU without a lock. Adding a lock will
introduce extra overhead in some critical path, e.g. context switch.
The patch is good enough for the common case. We may leave the other
complicated cases as they are.

Changes since V1:
- Disabling interrupts to prevent the events in current CPU's cpuc
  going away and getting freed.
- Update comments and description
