If cpu_up fails despite being in the present map and we explicitly
selected it as the housekeeper? I think it would be okay to print
a message telling admin to correct the config, and panic.

We try a best effort to make the system boot and limp along, but if
you misconfigure it, crashing is not unreasonable. There's lots of
command line option misconfiguration that will cause the same thing.

The primary problem with my patch that needs to be addressed is that
the error is not explicitly caught and printed if the housekeeper
does not come up, so the system might die in non-obvious ways.

I considered that when looking at the series, but couldn't justify
the complexity based on my usage (which is static boot time).

If you have other uses for it, then that would solve all these boot
time issues as well, which will be nice.

Thanks,
