This was breaking my build when using Clang and the LLVM linker with Link
Time Optimization (LTO) enabled, which is a prerequisite for enabling
Clang's Control Flow Integrity (CFI) feature that seeks to protect
indirect function calls from intentional (or accidental) manipulation.
Adding CFI to kernel builds is an ongoing project to further defend the
kernel from attacks[1], which many system builders are interested in
deploying.

Okay, fair enough. I thought the patch seemed like a reasonable middle
ground, but I'll revisit it.

There seem to be a lot of weird visibility differences between GCC and
Clang with respect to asm. This is just declared differently from the
other many cases.

I'll see if I can find a better work-around.
