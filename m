Hi Marc,

Two more questions below.

The spec says, ITS does not share vPE table with Redistributors when
SVPET==0.  It seems that we miss this rule and simply regard SVPET as
GICR_TYPER_COMMON_LPI_AFF here.  Am I wrong?

Thanks for your education!

I really want to know *how* does GICv4.1 ITS know about the vPE
residency (in hardware level)?

I can understand that Redistributor can easily achieve it by
VPENDBASER's Valid and vPEID field.  And it's necessary for ITS to
know the residency so that it can determine whether it's appropriate
to trigger default doorbell for vPE.  But I have no knowledge about
how can it be achieved in hardware details.

Thanks in advance for your pointer. :)
