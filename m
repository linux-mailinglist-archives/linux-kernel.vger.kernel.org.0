We should just remove no_pcs_sw_reset and let existing code take care
of PHY reset for UFS.
QMP PHY reset for UFS was differently handled earlier compared to USB/PCie
and relied on core for PHY reset. That is not the case with addition of
PCS based sw_reset and this won't change in future. There is no need to
have UFS specific flag in this driver.
