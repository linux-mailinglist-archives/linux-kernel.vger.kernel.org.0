I think this will come up again (it did already come up in some other
patch I reviewed, and Paul also mentioned it), so it seems best to
change data_race() to match the intuitive semantics of just completely
ignoring the access marked with it. I.e. marking accesses racing with
accesses marked with data_race() is now optional:
  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200331193233.15180-1-elver@google.com

In which case, the original patch you had here works just fine.

Thanks,
