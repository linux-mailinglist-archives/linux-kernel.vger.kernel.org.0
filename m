It is. Quoting man fcntl

   File status flags
       Each  open  file  description has certain associated status
flags, initialized by open(2) and possibly modified by
       fcntl().  Duplicated file descriptors (made with dup(2),
fcntl(F_DUPFD), fork(2), etc.) refer  to  the  same  open
       file description, and thus share the same file status flags.

...  On Linux, this  command
              can  change  only  the O_APPEND, O_ASYNC, O_DIRECT,
O_NOATIME, and O_NONBLOCK flags.

That doesn't really help - and I'm a bit surprised you'd even suggest
that. I don't know if open(/proc/self/fd/...) would give you a new
struct file.

Yes, I agree that that's not ideal either. And probably it's not a big
problem in practice (I don't think a lot of people build the docs, let
alone do it while also building the kernel), but it might be rather
surprising and somewhat hard to "debug" to suddenly have a load twice
what one expected.

Yes, a more general solution would be some kind of generic wrapper that
would hog however many tokens it could get hold of and run a given
command with a commandline slightly modified to hand over those tokens -
then wait for that process to exit and give back the tokens. That would
work for any command that knows about parallelism but doesn't support
the make jobserver model. (I'd probably implement that by creating a
pipe, fork(), then exec into the real command, while the child simply
blocks in a read on the pipe waiting for EOF and then writes back the
tokens, to simplify the "we have to report exit/killed-by-signal status
to the parent).
