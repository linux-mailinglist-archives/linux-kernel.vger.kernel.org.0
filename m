Subject: [RFC PATCH] ceph: initialize superblock s_time_gran to 1

Having granularity set to 1us results in having inode timestamps with a
accurancy different from the fuse client (i.e. atime, ctime and mtime will
always end with '000').  This patch normalizes this behaviour and sets the
granularity to 1.

Hi!

As far as I could see there are no other side-effects of changing
s_time_gran but I'm really not sure why it was initially set to 1000 in
the first place so I may be missing something.
