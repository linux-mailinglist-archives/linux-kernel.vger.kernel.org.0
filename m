glibc tries to load NSS and NIS stuff, yes. But what is the problem?

The goal of CONFIG_STATIC_LINK is that you can run UML without dependencies,
this used to work since ever. Lately it broke, but hey, let's fix it.
I have tons of old statically linked UML systems on my disk which I can
just run because they don't depend on specific libs.

Thanks,
