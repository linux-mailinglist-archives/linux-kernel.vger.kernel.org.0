Can you elaborate on the refcounting scheme? I don't quite understand
how there would be complications with that.

Generally, references are held for each page that is allocated in the
page_counter. try_charge() allocates a batch of css references,
returns one and keeps the rest in stock.

So couldn't the following work?

When somebody allocates a subpage, the css reference returned by
try_charge() is shared by the allocated subpage object and the
remainder that is kept via stock->subpage_cache and stock->nr_bytes
(or memcg->nr_stocked_bytes when the percpu cache is reset).

When the subpage objects are freed, you'll eventually have a full page
again in stock->nr_bytes, at which point you page_counter_uncharge()
paired with css_put(_many) as per usual.

A remainder left in old->nr_stocked_bytes would continue to hold on to
one css reference. (I don't quite understand who is protecting this
remainder in your current version, actually. A bug?)

Instead of doing your own batched page_counter uncharging in
refill_subpage_stock() -> drain_subpage_stock(), you should be able to
call refill_stock() when stock->nr_bytes adds up to a whole page again.

Again, IMO this would be much cleaner architecture if there was a
try_charge_bytes() byte allocator that would sit on top of a cleanly
abstracted try_charge() page allocator, just like the slab allocator
is sitting on top of the page allocator - instead of breaking through
the abstraction layer of the underlying page allocator.
