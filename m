Hmm, it seems that solving this might be pretty tricky.

I see this as a warning that we should not play with fire.
There might be a reason why all format modifiers are put
between % and the format identifier.

I would prefer to avoid %pe. It would make sense only when the value
really contains error id. It means that it has to be used as:

    if (IS_ERR(p)) {
       pr_warn(...);

The error path might handle the error using PTR_ERR() also
on other locations. Also PTR_ERR() will make it clear that we
are trying to print the error code.
