Hi Jason,
	Thanks for reviewing patches on Christmas Day:)
	The PCI MSI-x has several advantages over PCI MSI, mainly 
1) support 2048 vectors, much more than 32 vectors supported by MSI.
2) dedicated address/data for each vector,
3) per vector mask/pending bits.
The proposed MMIO MSI extension supports both 1) and 2), but the extension doesn’t support 3) because
we noticed that the Linux virtio subsystem doesn’t really make use of interrupt masking/unmasking.

On the other hand, we want to simplify VMM implementations as simple as possible, and mimicking the PCI MSI-x
will cause some complexity to VMM implementations.

> 2) It's better to split notify_multiplexer out of MSI support to ease the reviewers (apply to spec patch as well)
Great suggestion, we will try to split the patch.

Thanks,
Gerry
