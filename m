I see the following error printed at each boot:

    /panel: could not find node 'panel-timing'

The error originates from this snip (from panel-simple.c):

       if (!of_get_display_timing(dev->of_node, "panel-timing", &dt))
                panel_simple_parse_panel_timing_node(dev, panel, &dt);

of_get_display_timing() returns -2 (-ENOENT).

In the setup I use there is no panel-timing node as the timing specified
in panel-simple.c is fine.
This is the typical setup - and there should not in the normal case
be printed error messages like this during boot.

Will you please take a look at this.

	Sam
