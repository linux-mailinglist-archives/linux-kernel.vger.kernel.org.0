The other aspect I am concerned about is freedom given to the compiler
to perform the store to __num_online_cpus non-atomically, or the load
non-atomically due to memory pressure. Is that something we should be
concerned about ?

I thought we had WRITE_ONCE and READ_ONCE to take care of that kind of
situation.

The semantic I am looking for here is C11's relaxed atomics.
