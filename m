Hi Linus,

/* Summary */
This pull request contains the copy_struct_from_user() helper which got
split out from the openat2() patchset. It is a generic interface designed
to copy a struct from userspace.

The helper will be especially useful for structs versioned by size of which
we have quite a few. This allows for backwards compatibility, i.e. an
extended struct can be passed to an older kernel, or a legacy struct can be
passed to a newer kernel. For the first case (extended struct, older
kernel) the new fields in an extended struct can be set to zero and the
struct safely passed to an older kernel.

The most obvious benefit is that this helper lets us get rid of duplicate
code present in at least sched_setattr(), perf_event_open(), and clone3().
More importantly it will also help to ensure that users implementing
versioning-by-size end up with the same core semantics. This point is
especially crucial since we have at least one case where versioning-by-size
is used but with slighly different semantics: sched_setattr(),
perf_event_open(), and clone3() all do do similar checks to
copy_struct_from_user() while rt_sigprocmask(2) always rejects
differently-sized struct arguments.

With this pull request we also switch over sched_setattr(),
perf_event_open(), and clone3() to use the new helper.

I have carried these patches in a separate branch and taken care for them
to show up in linux-next. The only separate fix we we had to apply
was for a warning by clang when building the tests for using the result of
an assignment as a condition without parantheses. Given that this is a
reasonably sized change with proper testing it seemed ok to me to include
this in an rc2. If things break, we're around to fix them.
