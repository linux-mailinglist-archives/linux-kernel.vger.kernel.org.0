OK. So you understand what's going on in the hardware.

Yes. And that is expected since the reset is asserted.

You mean the display pipeline bind as usual, regardless of whether
you reset in probe or in bind, right?

That is because the TCON and DSI blocks bind _after_ the TCON TOP block.
The display component is traversed breadth first, and components bind
in that order.

What I'm trying to tell you is not that the display pipeline will stop
working, but that you have a problem with how you use the API in the
TCON TOP driver.


When you call clk_hw_register_gate(), you are saying that from this point
onward, the clock that got registered is available and will work properly,
or it will return an error if not.

That is not the case here. Because the TCON TOP reset control is deasserted
and the bus clock enabled much later, right _now_ any attempts to control
the newly registered gate will silently fail, because writes to the register
do not go through.

    tcon top probe                        tcon top bind
--[--------------|-]------------>-------[------|--------]------------->
                 |                             |
                 clk_hw_register_gate()        |
                                               reset_control_deassert()
                                               clk_prepare_enable()


So the above is what is happening with your patch:

Between the two square bracket blocks, if any consumer tries to use the
clocks created by clk_hw_register_gate(), it will silently fail, because
the function calls enabling the TCON TOP block happen much later.

Again, the problem is not that the display pipeline stops working. Instead
it is more fundamental: the code is not living up to the API contract that
it declared it is following.

There is also another register/unregister mismatch in this driver. You
moved clk_hw_register_gate(), but the corresponding clk_hw_unregister_gate()
calls that need to happen are still in the unbind function.

So if I were to probe but not bind the driver, and then subsequently
remove the driver, it would be leaking the registered clocks. (At this
point the clocks might not even have code backing them, since I might
have removed the module. I'm not sure if that's possible.) If I try
to probe the driver again, it will fail because it tries to register
clocks with the same names as the ones leaked in the previous round.
