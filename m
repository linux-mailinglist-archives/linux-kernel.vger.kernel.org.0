Rootcausing additional (re)faults is really difficult. We're talking
about a slight trend change in caching behavior in a sea of millions
of pages. There could be so many factors causing this, and for most
you have to patch debugging stuff into the kernel to rule them out.

A CPU regression you can figure out with perf.

Personally, I'm not convinced by this patch. I think it's a pretty
drastic change in aging heuristics just to address a CPU overhead
problem that has simpler, easier to verify, alternative solutions.

It WOULD be great to clarify and improve the aging model for mapped
cache, to make it a bit easier to reason about. But this patch does
not really get there either. Instead of taking a serious look at
mapped cache lifetime and usage scenarios, the changelog is more in
"let's see what breaks if we take out this screw here" territory.

So I'm afraid I don't think the patch & changelog in its current shape
should go upstream.
