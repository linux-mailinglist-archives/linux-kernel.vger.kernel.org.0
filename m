These should not be affected at all, since they don't go through the EFI stub.

These changes only affect the interaction between the EFI firmware and
the EFI stub. Anything that relies on the raw x86 boot protocol (jump
to offset 0x0 for 32-bit or offset 0x200 for 64-bit) or the EFI
handover protocol (find the boot offset in the setup header and jump
into the image at the discovered offset) will work as before, although
the EFI handover protocol is something I would like to get rid of at
some point in the future. Kexec typically mimics the handover between
the EFI stub and the kernel, not the EFI firmware and the EFI stub, so
I would not expect kexec to be affected at all by any of this.

In general, the intent is to make kexec idempotent, i.e., to make the
first boot as similar as we can to subsequent kexec boots, which is
why we are pushing back against adding bespoke interfaces to pass ACPI
rsdp pointer, smbios table addresses etc.
