Thanks a lot for the nice cocaching and quick response!

What the problem for me here is I didn't find a bug here. From the commit_charge's explanations and mem_cgroup_commit_charge comments, as well as call path when lrucare is ture, The lock is just to guard the task migration(which would be lead to move_account) So, It's just a clean up to give up locking when !PageLRU in patch 9. And even w/o patch 9, the page just locked root_mem_cgroup's lru_lock, same as old function does, while the page isn't on any LRU. Useless, but it's still safe.

Do you mind to point out anything else I missed?

Thanks a lot!
Alex
