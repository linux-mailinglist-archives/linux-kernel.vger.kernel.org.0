Andrew, Michal

I'm wondering what's the best way here to get the patches touching mm 
reviewed and accepted?
While drm people and VMware internal people have looked at them, I think 
the huge_fault() fallback splitting and the introduction of 
vma_is_special_huge() needs looking at more thoroughly.

Apart from that, if possible, I think the best way to merge this series 
is also through a DRM tree.

Thanks,
Thomas
