What sort of confusion might we expect?  Or, to channel akpm, "what are the
user-visible effects of this bug"?

So this seems like a good thing to do.  I do have a couple of small issues,
though... 

[...]

This (and the shebang line in the script itself) will cause the docs build
to fail on systems lacking Python 3.  While we have talked about requiring
Python 3 for the docs build, we have not actually taken that step yet.  We
probably shouldn't sneak it in here.  I don't see anything in the script
that should require a specific Python version, so I think it should be
tweaked to be version-independent and just invoke "python".

By license-rules.rst, this should be GPL-2.0+

So I have come to really dislike bare "except" clauses; I've seen them hide
too many bugs.  In this case, perhaps it's justified, but still ... it bugs
me ...

This one, I think, should be explicit; anything other than EWOULDBLOCK
indicates a real problem, right?

You made writer nonblocking, so it seems plausible that we could leak some
slots here, no?  Does writer really need to be nonblocking?

The last question I have is...why is it that we have to do this complex
dance rather than just passing the "-j" option through directly to sphinx?
That comes down to the "confusion" mentioned at the top, I assume.  It
would be good to understand that?

Thanks,
