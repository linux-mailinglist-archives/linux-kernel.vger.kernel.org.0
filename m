This paragraph here is the key. The firmware won't necessarily have a device
tree node, and in the current design it will not, since Linux never communicates
with it directly. All communication goes through ATF via PSCI.

See above. I don't expect that the firmware would have a device tree node,
because the firmware doesn't need any Linux drivers.

In the future, we might use SCPI clocks/sensors/regulators/etc. from Linux, but
that's not the plan at the moment. Given that it's already been two years since
I started this project, I'm trying to limit its scope so I can get at least some
part merged. The first step is to integrate a firmware that provides
suspend/resume functionality only. That firmware does implement SCPI, and if the
top-level Linux SCPI driver worked with multiple mailbox channels, it could
query the firmware's version and fetures. But all of the SCPI commands used for
suspend/resume must go through ATF via PSCI.

Do you have a better way to model "firmware uses this clock behind the scenes,
so Linux please don't touch it"? It's unfortunate that we have Linux and
firmware fighting over the R_CCU, but since we didn't have firmware (e.g. SCPI
clocks) in the beginning, it's where we are today.

The AR100 clock doesn't actually have a gate, and it generally has dependencies
like R_INTC in use. So as I mentioned in the commit message, the clock will
normally be on anyway. The goal was to model the fact that there are users of
this clock that Linux doesn't/can't know about.
