I don't argue against having a kernel parameter, but just wanting to 
point
out another alternative (which might be controversial):

  - What is the purpose of this unlock_all() at all. Apparently there are
    some flashes which have the protection bits set. Either at startup
    (and then they are non-volatile) or they come in that state out of 
the
    factory. The latter makes little sense IMHO.

  - Actually, all newer flashes we've used have these bits non-volatile 
and
    are unlocked by default.

So can't we have a whitelist (ie. a new flag in the spi_nor_ids) which
supresses the unlock if they haven't any block protections bit set
according to the manual? Because in this case the unlocking makes never
sense IMHO.
