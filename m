This is very confusing. IIUC it suggests that while printing
the backtrace for non-current tasks the do/while loop does not
exit because fp and fp+8 might have the same value ? When would
this happen ? Even in that case the commit message here does not
properly match the change in this patch.

This patch tries to stop printing the stack for non-current tasks
if their state change while there is one dump_backtrace() trying
to print back trace. Dont we have any lock preventing a task in
this situation (while dumping it's backtrace) from running again
or changing state.

Should 'saved_state|sp|fp' instead as its applicable to non-current
tasks only.

This does not check any explicit task states like 'un-interruptible' or
'running' but instead tracks change from any previously 'saved' state.

Then dump_backtrace() must detect it, should not save it and just abort.

Thats not a reliable solution. AFICS we should not proceed further if
there is a chance of an wrong trace or an infinite loop. Hoping that
the printing will stop when task gets scheduled out does not seem right.

Why does any of these three mismatches detect the problematic transition
not just the state ?
