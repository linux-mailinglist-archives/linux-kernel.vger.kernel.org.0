So why can't you have:

cooling-device = <&cpu0 DVFS>;

cooling-device = <&cpu0 IDLE>;

(any additional cells omitted for simplicity)

What I meant was a phandle in the cooling cells, so #cooling-cells == 3:

cooling-device = <&cpu0 0 0 &cpu_idle_state>, <&cpu1 0 0 &cpu_idle_state>;

Phandle args being a phandle is a bit unusual, but certainly possible.
