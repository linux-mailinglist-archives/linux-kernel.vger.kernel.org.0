Ah, OK - I'm all too familiar with bootloaders having image size limits, 
but I'm also used to implicitly-initialised statics being collected into 
a runtime-initialised .bss section, so I hadn't realised that there 
might still be platforms where that space is actually allocated in the 
image at link-time.

Indeed, and that alone might have been a reasonable rationale for the 
patch - I was merely querying the wording of the commit message, not its 
intent :)

Thanks,
Robin.
