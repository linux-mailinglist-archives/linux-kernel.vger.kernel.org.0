Actually, last time I looked both the BSP U-Boot and mainline do contain 
equivalent code to initialise both PLLs to (IIRC) 600MHz and apparently 
adjust a couple of other things set by the maskrom. The trap is that 
mainline does it in the SPL - thus the unfortunately common combination 
of using the upstream main stage with the miniloader ends up missing out 
that step entirely. In comparison, I'm now using the full upstream 
TPL/SPL flow on my RK3399 board (NanoPC-T4) and even a full generic 
distro kernel is acceptably quick:

[    2.315378] Trying to unpack rootfs image as initramfs...
[    2.781747] Freeing initrd memory: 7316K
...
[    4.239990] Freeing unused kernel memory: 1984K
[    4.247829] Run /init as init process
