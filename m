I mean projects like Chromium which seems to be comparable to kernel
in code size/rate of change. LLVM, Android are several times smaller,
but on the other hand has hundreds times less trees (1).  And in
particular large monorepos in companies like Google, Facebook,
Microsoft. E.g. the Google codebase sees the v5.2 number of changesets
in few hours. Although, it's not apples-to-apples with the kernel but
shows that scale per-se is not a requirement for multiple
trees/non-linear history.
So for the kernel it must a combination of scale + something else (in
the process, ownership model, ...). I am trying to understand what is
that something else, how inherent it is and what would degrade if
kernel switches to single tree/linear history. It would obviously
require some adjustments to other parts of the process as well, e.g.
you asked what maintainers do with their trees but if there is a
single tree, they don't have a tree at all. In most other scalable
processes that I am aware of, as much work as possible is pushed down
to individual contributors and they do any required rebasing. The
closest analog of maintainers only do review and approval. The idea is
to remove bottlenecks and distribute process as much as possible to
increase scalability. I heard about "maintainer scalability" in the
context of the kernel process multiple times.
