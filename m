Andi's point is that string instructions might be a better bet in a long
run. You may win something with MOVNTI on current CPUs, but it may become
a burden on newer microarchitectures when string instructions improves.
Nobody realistically would re-validate if MOVNTI microoptimazation still
make sense for every new microarchitecture.

Have you got any data for a macrobenchmark?
