And thinking about that this also begs for a comment in the code to
explain that some (which?) mappings might have a mismatch and the
generic code have to be careful. Because as things stand now this seems
to be really subtle and happen to work _now_ and might break in the future.
Or what does prevent a generic code to stumble over this discrepancy?
