Oh, I see, found it, thanks. Very interesting tool.
https://github.com/openSUSE/aaa_base/blob/master/get_kernel_version.c

And the only usage of this tool I found is to get the kernel version of
/boot/image (on s390) to run depmod during
yast-installation/src/clients/network_finish.rb

I also see that queries to rpm are already done from
yast-yast2/library/system/src/modules/Kernel.rb
Wouldn't it be more reliable (and portable) to just get the kernel
version from rpm metadata? Without using unreliable tools? Or find some
other solution, since this is the only use case for the tool?
$ rpm -qf --qf '%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{ARCH}\n' /boot/vmlinuz-5.1.17-300.fc30.x86_64
5.1.17-300.fc30.x86_64
[it looks like openSUSE kernel rpms don't have metadata to reconstruct
full kernel version currently, but that could be improved?]

Anyhow, I'm not opposed to an idea to make it possible to detect the
kernel version from bzImage. But it should be reliable. So, see the
follow on patch I'm sending.
