Hey Heikki,

I spoke with Benson and Prashant and you raise a good point. Moving
forward we should probably be describing these capabilities in ACPI.
We do want to support existing devices, and making changes to the ACPI
tables would mean firmware modifications for each and every one, which
is a complicated process.

To date the port capabilities on all ChromeOS devices have been the
same. I recall now that we don't (and with current firmware can't)
query the port capabilities from the EC; they're just hard coded into
the driver. In the absence of these nodes in the ACPI tables we can
populate these capabilities in software nodes. This would allow us to
support existing systems without the expensive firmware change, and I
think it still provides the scalability you're asking for.

Are you suggesting that every port on the device gets its own ACPI/DT node?

Thanks,
-Jon
