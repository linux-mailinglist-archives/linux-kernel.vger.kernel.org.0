This comment makes no sense whatsoever. If period_ts is 0,
i.e. something invoked touch_softlockup_watchdog*() then it does not
make any difference whether the kvm function invokes one of those
functions once more. The result is the same. The per cpu period_ts is
still 0.

The point is that _AFTER_ a intentional watchdog reset, the reporting
base time needs to be set to now() in order to make it functional again.

Btw, the function name is misleading. I got confused several times
because I expected the reset to set the timestamp to 0, which is not the
case. update_report_period_ts() is far more intuitive.

This lacks a comment. Your changelog paragraph:

is probably referring to this, but it confused me more than it helped
simply because the update of the timestamp happens unconditionally even
when the backtrace code is not reached due to the KVM check

So this is a change vs. the current implementation which is not
documented and explained.
