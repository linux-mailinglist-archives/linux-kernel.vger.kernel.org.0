So, the comment here is a generic one while the bad location part in the
commit description is actually from OMAP remoteproc usage perspective
(if you remember the dev_warn messages we added to the memory-region
parse logic in the driver).

Before the fixed-memory carveout support, all the DMA allocations in
remoteproc core were made from the rproc platform device's DMA pool (
which can be NULL). That is lost after the fixed-memory support, and
they were always allocated from global DMA pools if no dedicated pools
are used. After this patch, that continues to be case for drivers that
still do not use any dedicated pools, while it does restore the usage of
the platform device's DMA pool if a driver uses one (OMAP remoteproc
falls into the latter).

I think that can work as well but I feel it is lot more cumbersome. It
does require every platform driver to add code adding/registering that
carveout, and parse the reserved memory region etc. End of the day, we
rely on DMA API and we just have to assign the region to the newly
created device. The DMA pool assignment for devices using
reserved-memory nodes has simply been the of_reserved_mem_device_init()
function.
