Explain why this is an issue. Because as things stand now this doesn't
cause any problems at all. All architectures simply support migrating
all hugetlb sizes AFAIK. If this is not the case then mention which of
them are not.

I do not follow. What are you trying to say here?

The changelog should be explicit it doesn't really fix any existing
problem. And the whole purpose is a code robustness cleanup. Should we
ever have an architecture that doesn't support all hugetlb sizes then
we would safe pointless huge page isolation for a page that cannot be
migrated in the first place.

See how the above actually explains _why_ you want to make the change?

This is also of no relevance.
