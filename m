I spent some time looking at this.  Without the patch, I
measured around 3.5ms to send/receive a get device ID message
and uses 100% of the CPU on a core.

I measured your patch, it slowed it down to around 10.5ms
per message, which is not good.  Though it did just use a
few percent of the core.

I wrote some code to auto-adjust the timer.  It settled on
a delay around 35us, which gave 4.7ms per message, which is
probably acceptable, and used around 40% of the CPU.  If
I use any timeout (even a 0-10us range) it won't go below
4ms per message.

The process is running at nice 19 priority, so it won't
have a significant effect on other processes from a priority
point of view.  It may still be hitting the scheduler locks
pretty hard, though.  But I played with things quite a bit
and the behavior or the management controller is too
erratic to set a really good timeout.  Maybe other ones
are better, don't know.

One other option we have is that the driver has something
called "maintenance mode".  If it detect that you have
reset the management controller or are issuing firmware
commands, it will modify timeout behavior.  It can also
be activated manually.  I could also make it switch to
just calling schedule instead of delaying when in that
mode.

The right thing it do is complain bitterly to vendors who
build hardware that has to be polled.  But besides that,
I'm thinking the maintenance mode is the thing to do.
It will also change behavior if you reset the management
controller, but only for 30 seconds or so.  Does that
work?
