tcon-pixel clock is the rate that you want to achive on display side and
if you have 4 lanes 32bit or lanes and different bit number that you need
to have a clock that is able to put outside bits and speed equal to
pixel-clock * bits / lanes. so If you want a pixel-clock of 40 mhz
and you have 32bits and 4 lanes you need to have a clock of
40 * 32 / 4 in no-burst mode. I think that this is done but most of the display.
Now in burst mode I don't know how should work the calculation of the
clock for the
require bandwidth and even I understand your comment I would like to have your
clock tree after you boot on the display side and if it is possible I
want to assemble a kit
like you have.

Well when you push your code you said that you have tested on more
then one display.
Can I know where are the others?

Yes, the idea is to make progress. Thank you about your helping
