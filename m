Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: Call out example SYM_FUNC_* usage as x86-specific
Date:   Wed, 15 Jan 2020 18:43:05 +0000

The example given in asm-annotations.rst to describe the constraints that
a function should meet in order to be annotated with a SYM_FUNC_* macro
is x86-specific, and not necessarily applicable to architectures using
branch-and-link style calling conventions such as arm64.

Tweak the example text to call out the x86-specific text.

As an aside: if somebody could explain the high-level guarantees required
here for things like livepatching, then I'd be happy to try to put together
another patch adding an example for arm64. I'm currently not completely sure
about what is required in the face of things like leaf functions and tail calls.
