I fully agree about the PHY driver. I'm expect this device is
violating c22 when it modifies the advertisement register itself. So
all bets are off for the genphy.

We have a couple of other PHYs which support downshift. We should see
if we can follow what they do. What is i think important is that
read_status return the correct speed. So we probably cannot use
genphy_read_status() as is. Maybe we should split genphy_read_status()
into two, so the register reading bit can be done unconditionally by
phy drivers for hardware which don't report link down when they
should?
