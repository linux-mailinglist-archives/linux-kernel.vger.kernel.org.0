Park offered to help with a new version, and the Samsung guys are going
through their internal review process to work upstream it.  Remember
it is their codebase in each of the variants here.  While it is fine
if we take some code that has been abandoned by the original developers
and still merge it with helping hands I think it is very rude to not
at least wait for them to get their act of working with their corporate
overlords together first.  It isn't like we've been waiting forever
for an exfat driver - the patent grant has been extremely recent, and
this whole thing just seems like a publicity stunt to be honest.  Give
them a couple weeks to sort their stuff out and then we can decide
how to proceed.  I for one would defintively prefer to have code
maintained by the original maintainers if possible.  And not have
them hindered by the staging process to work on their own code.

Following how staging works and its arcane rules I don't want it to be
anywhere near fs code.  And seriously, it is not like we need one
magic tree to deal with all file systems.  The whole point of git is
that people can setup a tree to collaborate wherever they want if you
just find people to work on it.  And we've had tons of successful
drivers and filesystems that worked that way.  And at least the ones
I've followed seem a lot more productive than the staging show that
is ba—ïed around coding style cleanup micropatches.
