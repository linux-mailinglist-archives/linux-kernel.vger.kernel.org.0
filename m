Thanks for your explanation.

For extend slub object, if one record is 9B (sizeof(u8)+ sizeof(struct
kasan_track)) and add five records into slub object, every slub object
may add 45B usage after the system runs longer. 
Slub object number is easy more than 1,000,000(maybe it may be more
bigger), then the extending object memory usage should be 45MB, and
unfortunately it is no limit. The memory usage is more bigger than our
patch.

We hope tag-based KASAN advantage is smaller memory usage. If itâ€™s
possible, we should spend less memory in order to identify
use-after-free. Would you accept our patch after fine tune it?
