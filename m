Could we try instead to call a _nosync variant here when
cpumask_weight() is 1 or the *IS if greater than 1 and avoid the IPI?

Will tried this in the past but because of the task placement after
fork()+execve(), I think we always ended up with a weight of 2 in the
child process. Your first patch "solves" this by flushing the TLBs on
context switch (bar the CnP case). Can you give it a try to see if it
improves things? At least it's a starting point for further
investigation.

I fully agree with Will that we don't want two different TLB handling
implementations in the arm64 kernel and even less desirable to have a
command line option.

Thanks.
