I am still not happy with the above much. What would say about something
like below instead?
"
It is not that hard to trigger lockdep splats by calling printk from
under zone->lock. Most of them are false positives caused by lock chains
introduced early in the boot process and they do not cause any real
problems. There are some console drivers which do allocate from the
printk context as well and those should be fixed. In any case false
positives are not that trivial to workaround and it is far from optimal
to lose lockdep functionality for something that is a non-issue.

I would remove this paragraph altogether. The real problem is that we do
not really want to make dump_page deferred.

Again this begs for some more explanation why this is ok. Something like
the following:
"
Even though has_unmovable_pages doesn't hold any reference to the
returned page this should be reasonably safe for the purpose of
reporting the page (dump_page) because it cannot be hotremoved. The
state of the page might change but that is the case even with the
existing code as zone->lock only plays role for free pages.

With improved changelog and after addressing one more thing below, feel

Thanks for working on this. I have to say I have disliked the initial
version because they were really hacky. This one can be reasoned about
at least. has_unmovable_pages returning an unmovable page actually makes
some conceptual sense to me.

You want to move this WARN_ON as well. Not only because it is using
printk as well but also because we do not really want to trigger the
warning from userspace via is_mem_section_removable. Maybe worth a patch
on its own?
