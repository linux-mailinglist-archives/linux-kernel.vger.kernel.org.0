Another use case I'm considering is using latency-nice to prefer an idle CPU if
latency-nice is set otherwise go for the most energy efficient CPU.

Ie: sacrifice (some) energy for latency.

The way I see interpreting latency-nice here as a binary switch. But maybe we
can use the range to select what (some) energy to sacrifice mean here. Hmmm.
