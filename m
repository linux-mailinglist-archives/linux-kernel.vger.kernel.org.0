Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] Add new tracepoints required for EAS testing
Date:   Fri, 10 May 2019 12:30:06 +0100

Changes in v2:
	- Add include guards to the newly added headers
	- Rename tracepoints:
		sched_load_rq -> pelt_rq
		sched_load_se -> pelt_se
	- Rename helper functions: s/sched_tp/sched_trace/
	- Make sched_trace*() less fat by reducing path size to 20 bytes from
	  64.
	- Fix compilation error when building on UP


The following patches add the bare minimum tracepoints required to perform EAS
testing in Lisa[1].

The new tracepoints are bare in a sense that they don't export any info in
tracefs, hence shouldn't introduce any ABI. The intended way to use them is by
loading a module that will probe the tracepoints and extract the info required
for userspace testing.

It is done in this way because adding new TRACE_EVENTS() is no longer accepted
AFAIU.

The tracepoints are focused around tracking PELT signals which is what EAS uses
to make its decision, hence knowing the value of PELT as it changes allows
verifying that EAS is doing the right thing based on synthetic tests that
simulate different scenarios.

Beside EAS, the new tracepoints can help investigate CFS load balancer and CFS
taskgroup handling as they are both based on PELT signals too.

The first 2 patches do a bit of code shuffling to expose some required
functions.

Patch 3 adds a new cfs helper function.

Patches 4-6 add the new tracepoints.

Patch 7 exports the tracepoints so that out of tree modules can probe the new
tracepoints with least amount of effort - which extends the usefulness of the
tracepoints since creating a module to probe them is the only way to access
them.

An example module that uses these tracepoints is available in [2].
