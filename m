The problem is knowing which of those links to delete and when.

If a link between S and C fails, how do we know and keep track of
which of the other 100 links in the system are causing a cycle? It can
get unwieldy real quick. We could delete all the links to fall back to
status quo, but how do we tell at what point in time we can delete
them all?

Which is why I think we need to have a commandline/config option to
turn this series on. Keep in mind that once this patch is merged, the
API for the supplier drivers would be the same whether the feature is
enabled or not. They just fallback to status quo behavior (do their
stuff in late_initcall_sync() like they do today).

This patch series has a huge impact on the behavior and I don't think
there's a sound reason to force it on everyone right away. This is
something that needs incremental changes to bring in more and more
platforms/drivers into the new scheme. At a minimum Qualcomm seems
pretty interested in using this to solve their "when do I change/turn
off this clock/interconnect after boot?" question.
