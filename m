I very strongly suggest that this only be done as a last resort and with
supporting data as to why it is necessary. NUMA balancing did have rate
limiting at one point and it was removed when balancing was smart enough
to mostly do the right thing without rate limiting. I posted a series
that reconciled NUMA balancing with the CPU load balancer recently which
further reduced spurious and unnecessary migrations. I would not like
to see rate limiting reintroduced unless there is no other way of fixing
saturation of memory bandwidth due to NUMA balancing. Even if it's
needed as a stopgap while the feature is finalised, it should be
introduced late in the series explaining why it's temporarily necessary.
