I rather wait for a solution that integrates with our mature stack for
TIS (or these days FIFO) than integrate something half-baked. If you
want something in, please do right things right.

What you are proposing would mean maintaining duplicate stacks forever.

Absolutely not going to use that name. The naming convention is what
it is for other drivers that are adapt tpm_tis_core to different HW
interfaces.
