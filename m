I understand you being unhappy with this.

The problem is that Al Viro, after an initial review around v2 or v3 of
the patch, which I believe I have fully addressed, has been ignoring
this patch / new fs for over a year now. I've pinged him repeatedly
both via email and on irc, but with no luck.  I guess he simply is
too busy with other stuff.

I did ask other fs developers to review and have gotten reviews
from David Howell and Christoph Hellwig. I've addressed all their
review remarks and I've had reviews of the newer versions with
just a few nitpicks remaining. I've also addressed those nitpicks.
But I never got an Acked-by or Reviewed-by from either of them
on any of the newer versions.

I even talked to various people about this at plumbers, but
I did not get any traction there either.

On the advice of Christoph I've asked Andrew Morton to take this
directly under fs/ instead, twice. When this all went no where I
went the staging route, with the current result.

So for 5.5, and assuming I can get David's and/or Christoph's
Acked-by, is is ok if I send this directly to you?

Regards,

Hans

p.s.

Christoph, David, can I get your Acked-by for the latest
version of the patch (v17) ?
