Never mind this suggestion, I don't think it makes any sense. If anything a=
rm64
seems to fit the ZONE_DMA usage pattern of arm and powerpc: where ZONE_DMA'=
s
size is decided based on ram size and/or board configuration. It was actual=
ly
set-up like this until Christoph's ad67f5a6545f7 ("arm64: replace ZONE_DMA =
with
ZONE_DMA32").

So the easy solution would be to simply revert that commit. On one hand I f=
eel
it would be a step backwards as most 64 bit architectures have been moving =
to
use ZONE_DMA32. On the other, current ZONE_DMA32 usage seems to be heavily
rooted on having a 32 bit DMA mask*, which will no longer be the case on ar=
m64
if we want to support the RPi 4.

So the way I see it and lacking a better solution, the argument is stronger=
 on
moving back arm64 to using ZONE_DMA. Any comments/opinions?

Note that I've been looking at all the DMA/CMA/swiotlb code to see if this
would break anything or change behaviors and couldn't find anything obvious=
. I
also tested the revert on my RPi4 and nothing seems to fail.

* A good example is dma-direct's implementation.
