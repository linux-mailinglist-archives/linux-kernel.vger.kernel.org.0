Harumph.  I think what we have here is a big mess in the spec, but
that is exactly why this is an RFC.

The MADT can have any of ~16 different subtables, as you note.  Of
those, only these require a numeric _UID:

   -- Type 0x0: Processor Local APIC
   -- Type 0x4: Local APIC NMI [0]
   -- Type 0x7: Processor Local SAPIC [1]
   -- Type 0x9: Processor Local x2APIC
   -- Type 0xa: Local x2APIC NMI [0]
   -- Type 0xb: GICC

Note [0]: a value of !0x0 is also allowed, indicating all processors
     [1]: this has two fields that could be interpreted as an ID when
          used together

It does not appear that you could build a usable system without any
of these subtables -- but perhaps someone knows of incantations that
could -- which is why I thought a string _UID might be viable.

If we consider the PPTT too, then yeah, _UID must be an integer for
some devices.

Thanks for the feedback; it forced me to double-check my thinking about
the MADT.  The root cause of the issue is not the kernel in this case,
but a lack of clarity in the spec -- or at least implied requirements
that probably need to be explicit.  I'll send in a spec change.
