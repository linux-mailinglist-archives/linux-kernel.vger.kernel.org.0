This should ideally happen before file systems are mounted so I don't 
see many alternatives for communicating which RTC should be used. 
Android uses the kernel command line for userspace parameters as well 
and that's an option but that defeats part of the value of doing it in 
userspace IMO. There's also device tree but I'm not sure this belongs there.

Hctosys is also saving and restoring the system time on suspend/resume. 
It seems more efficient to me to do this (which happens very frequently 
on an Android device) in the kernel as opposed to in userspace.

If I set the initial system time from the rtc in userspace but continue 
to rely on the hctosys suspend/resume code, as it stands there will be a 
window after the rtc driver is loaded but before the system time is set 
where if suspend is entered, the correct time in the rtc will be lost.

No argument with that, but millions of devices successfully rely on it 
today. AFAICT this simple patch doesn't make anything worse. Together 
with a change to support a kernel parameter for runtime rtc selection, 
it should allow RTC drivers to be modularized on many systems. Can it be 
adopted as a stopgap measure?
