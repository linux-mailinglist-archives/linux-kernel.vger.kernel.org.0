I don't understand your point here. If it's likely to be referenced
among several processes, it doesn't have the major fault latency.
What's your point here?

I tend to agree about security part in the description, but still don't
agree with performance concern in the description so I'd like to remove
it in the description. Current situation is caused by security concern
unfortunately, not performance reason.

The comment you provides explain what code does, not *why*.
Comment is always lack of explaining the whole story but we try to
demonstrate a certain context to make reader careful.
Havind said, I will not insist on it.

Thanks.
