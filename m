I could have explained this better, sorry!  I will explain the first
case below; other cases are similar.

In copy_user_to_fpregs_zeroing(), we have:

    if (user_xsave()) {
        ...
        if (unlikely(init_bv))
            copy_kernel_to_xregs(&init_fpstate.xsave, init_bv);
        return copy_user_to_xregs(buf, xbv);
        ...
    }

The copy_user_to_xregs() may fail, and when that happens, before going to
the slow path, there is fpregs_unlock() and context switches may happen.
However, at this point, fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx has not been changed; it could
still be another task's FPU.  For this to happen and to be detected, the user
stack page needs to be non-present, fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx need to be another task,
and that other task needs to be able to detect its registers are modified.
The last factor is not easy to reproduce, and a CET control-protection fault
helps.

What I do is, clone the whole glibc source, and run mutiple copies of
"make check".  In about 40 minutes or so, there are unexplained seg faults,
or a few control-protection faults (if you enable CET).  Please let me
know if more clarification is needed.

Thanks,
