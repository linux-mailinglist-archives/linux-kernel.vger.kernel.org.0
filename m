Still wondering how pfn_to_online_page() is applicable here. It validates
a given PFN and whether its online from sparse section mapping perspective
before giving it's struct page. IIUC it is used during a linear scanning
of a physical address range not for a page table walk. So how it can solve
the problem when a struct page which was used as an intermediate level page
table page gets released back to the buddy from another concurrent thread ?
