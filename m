+title: UniPhier System Bus
+
+description: |
+  The UniPhier System Bus is an external bus that connects on-board devices to
+  the UniPhier SoC. It is a simple (semi-)parallel bus with address, data, and
+  some control signals. It supports up to 8 banks (chip selects).
+
+  Before any access to the bus, the bus controller must be configured; the bus
+  controller registers provide the control for the translation from the offset
+  within each bank to the CPU-viewed address. The needed setup includes the
+  base address, the size of each bank. Optionally, some timing parameters can
+  be optimized for faster bus access.

+      Note:

+      implementation defined. Some SoCs can use 0x00000000-0x0fffffff and
+      0x40000000-0x4fffffff, while other SoCs only 0x40000000-0x4fffffff.

-UniPhier System Bus
-
-The UniPhier System Bus is an external bus that connects on-board devices to
-the UniPhier SoC.  It is a simple (semi-)parallel bus with address, data, and
-some control signals.  It supports up to 8 banks (chip selects).
-
-Before any access to the bus, the bus controller must be configured; the bus
-controller registers provide the control for the translation from the offset
-within each bank to the CPU-viewed address.  The needed setup includes the base
-address, the size of each bank.  Optionally, some timing parameters can be
-optimized for faster bus access.
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible: should be "socionext,uniphier-system-bus".
-- reg: offset and length of the register set for the bus controller device.
-- #address-cells: should be 2.  The first cell is the bank number (chip select).
-  The second cell is the address offset within the bank.
-- #size-cells: should be 1.
-- ranges: should provide a proper address translation from the System Bus to
-  the parent bus.
-
-Note:
-The address region(s) that can be assigned for the System Bus is implementation
-defined.  Some SoCs can use 0x00000000-0x0fffffff and 0x40000000-0x4fffffff,
-while other SoCs can only use 0x40000000-0x4fffffff.  There might be additional
-limitations depending on SoCs and the boot mode.  The address translation is

-the required alignment and they do not overlap one another.
-For example, it is possible to map:
-  bank 0 to 0x42000000-0x43ffffff, bank 5 to 0x46000000-0x46ffffff
-It is also possible to map:

-There is no reason to stick to a particular translation mapping, but the
-"ranges" property should provide a "reasonable" default that is known to work.
-The software should initialize the bus controller according to it.
-
-Example:
-
-	system-bus {
-		compatible = "socionext,uniphier-system-bus";
-		reg = <0x58c00000 0x400>;
-		#address-cells = <2>;
-		#size-cells = <1>;
-		ranges = <1 0x00000000 0x42000000 0x02000000
-			  5 0x00000000 0x46000000 0x01000000>;
-
-		ethernet@1,01f00000 {
-			compatible = "smsc,lan9115";
-			reg = <1 0x01f00000 0x1000>;
-			interrupts = <0 48 4>
-			phy-mode = "mii";

-			reg = <5 0x00200000 0x20>;
-			interrupts = <0 49 4>
-			clock-frequency = <12288000>;
-		};
-	};
-
-In this example,
- - the Ethernet device is connected at the offset 0x01f00000 of CS1 and
