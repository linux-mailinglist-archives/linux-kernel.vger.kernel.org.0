I don't think it's the right abstraction. The mailbox *controller* uses a specific func-id, this has to match the one the firmware expects. So this is a property of the mailbox transport channel (the SMC call), and the *client* should *not* care about it. It just sees the logical channel ID (if we have one), which the controller translates into the func-ID.

So it should really look like this (assuming only single channel controllers):
mailbox: smc-mailbox {
    #mbox-cells = <0>;
    compatible = "arm,smc-mbox";
    method = "smc";
    arm,func-id = <0x820000fe>;
};
scmi {
    compatible = "arm,scmi";
    mboxes = <&smc_mbox>;
    mbox-names = "tx"; /* rx is optional */
    shmem = <&cpu_scp_hpri>;
};

If you allow the client to provide the function ID (and I am not saying this is a good idea): where would this func ID come from? It would need to be a property of the client DT node, then. So one way would be to use the func ID as the Linux mailbox channel ID:
mailbox: smc-mailbox {
    #mbox-cells = <1>;
    compatible = "arm,smc-mbox";
    method = "smc";
};
scmi {
    compatible = "arm,scmi";
    mboxes = <&smc_mbox 0x820000fe>;
    mbox-names = "tx"; /* rx is optional */
    shmem = <&cpu_scp_hpri>;
};

But this doesn't look desirable.

And as I mentioned this before: allowing some mailbox clients to provide the function IDs sound scary, as they could use anything they want, triggering random firmware actions (think PSCI_CPU_OFF).

So I think we should have a required "arm,func-id" property, with exactly one 32-bit value (again assuming single channel controllers).

Cheers,
Andre.
