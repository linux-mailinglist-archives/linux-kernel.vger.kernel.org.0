[ That's not what a feature test macro is; a feature test macro allows the
  user to select some optional behaviour.  Things like _GNU_SOURCE.  ]

That is one reason to not want such a predefined macro.  Another reason
is that you usually need to compile some test programs *anyway*, to see if
some bug is present for example, or to see if the exact implementation of
the feature is beneficial (or harmful) to your program in some way.

The only comparable existing predefined macro is __PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME
it seems (no, I have no idea either).  Everything else is required by some
standard (a "standard standard" or a "vendor standard", I'm lumping
everything together here), or shows whether some target has some feature,
or how many bits there are in certain types, that kind of thing.

Why would GCC want to have macros for all features it has?  That would be
quite a few new ones every release.  And what about bug fixes, are bug
fixes features as well?

I think you need to solve your configuration problems in your
configuration system.
