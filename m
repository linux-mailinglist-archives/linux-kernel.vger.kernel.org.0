Not a chance.  The patches don't apply to any kernel in the git history.

Which may be part of your problem.  You are or at least were running
with code that has not been merged upstream.

Second.  I looked at your test results and they don't directly make
sense.  dmidecode bypasses the kernel completely or it did last time
I looked so I don't know why you would be using that to test if
something in the kernel is working.

However dmidecode failing suggests that the actual problem is something
in the first kernel is stomping the dmi tables.

Adding a command line option won't fix stomped tables.

So what I would suggest is:
a) Verify that dmidecode works before kexec.
b) Test to see if dmidecode works after kexec.
c) Once (a) shows that dmidecode works and (b) shows that dmidecode
   fails figure out what is stomping your dmi tables during or before
   kexec and that is what should get fixed.

Now using a non-efi method of dmi detection relies on the
tables being between 0xF0000 and 0x10000. AKA the last 64K
of the first 1MiB of memory.  You might check to see if your
dmi tables are in that address range.

Otherwise I suspect the good solution is to give efi it's own page
tables in the kernel and switch to it whenever efi functions are called.

But on 32bit the Linux kernel has historically been just fine directly
accessing the hardware, and ignoring efi and all of the other BIOS's.
So if that doesn't work on Intel Galileo that is probably a firmware
problem.
