I wasn't sure what was best here - 52282163dfa6 is a bug fix, so
reverting that followed by e21dd290881b would (re-)introduce a
regression for that one commit (i.e. not completely bisectable).
Reverting in the other order would work, but seems a little odd.
Squashing the reverts seemed the neatest option - but it's not my hand
at risk... :)

Perhaps it would be best to simply apply Mark's change followed by
something like the following. That way it's not actually a revert!
It also avoids (re-)adding the now redundant check in
panfrost_devfreq_init().

Subject: [PATCH] drm/panfrost: Remove NULL checks for regulator

devm_regulator_get() is now used to populate pfdev->regulator which
ensures that this cannot be NULL (a dummy regulator will be returned if
necessary). So remove the checks in panfrost_devfreq_target().
