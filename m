Hi Robin,

Thanks for taking a look at this.

Any pointers to the weirdness here after SMMU is turned off?
Because if we look at the call sites, device_shutdown is called
from kernel_restart_prepare or kernel_shutdown_prepare which would
mean system is going down anyways, so do we really care about these
error messages or warnings from SMMU?

  arm_smmu_device_shutdown
   platform_drv_shutdown
    device_shutdown
     kernel_restart_prepare
      kernel_restart


Thanks,
Sai
