Negative ERRNOs have BIT(31) set.

Since voltage integers on a 32 bit architecture represent =C2=B5V this =
would
still allow voltages up to (2^31 - 1) =C2=B5V i.e. 2 kV with BIT(31) not =
set.

Therefore it seems very unlikely that anyone needs to represent voltages
above 2 kV within a Linux system through a regulator.

So I'd say any negative return value got regulator_get_voltage() can be
treated as an error.

And regulators for negative voltages could be represented by
their absolute value (and maybe a _neg component in the regulator
name).

But then it seems to be a little inconsistent that the voltage
parameters of regulator_set_voltage_unlocked() are signed integers
and not unsigned.

So shouldn't that be protected against attempting to set negative =
voltages?

Just my 2 cts.
