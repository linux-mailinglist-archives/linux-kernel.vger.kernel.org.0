It is something in the NVM :)

Only way I can think of is to find yourself a Mac ;-)

Yes.

I think it will be extension to _OSC but as it is still under discussion
so subject to change.

Correct.

The point with start_icm is to act as "chicken bit" in case SW CM (Linux
driver) does not work properly. Nothing else. User can then switch back
to FW CM on their Apple system and get more "working" system hopefully
reporting this to us so we can try to figure out what's wrong with the
driver :)

I don't think it is good idea to have a module parameter to control
anything else that is supposed to be set in the BIOS/boot firmware.
