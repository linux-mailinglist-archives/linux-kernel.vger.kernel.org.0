Unfortunately it's more than just SoC.  While you need the SoC to be
able to support this type of wakeup, you also need the board design,
firmware design, regulator design, etc.  ...so I don't think we can
just use the SoC specific compatible string.

In fact, while testing this I found that USB wakeup was totally broken
unless I enabled "deep suspend" mode on my system.  Something about
the clocks / wakeup sources in the shallow suspend totally blocked it
and I couldn't figure out what.

...so I believe it really needs to be something where someone has
said: I tested it out on this board and everything is setup properly
to support USB wakeup.
