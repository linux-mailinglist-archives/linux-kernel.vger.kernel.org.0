I'm thinking of how to add a firmware description for it, how about this:

Adding a system level flag to indicate the supporting of TIBi by range,
which means adding a binding name for example "tlbi-by-range" at system
level in the dts file, or a tlbi by range flag in ACPI FADT table, then
we use the ID register per-cpu and the system level flag as

if (cpus_have_const_cap(ARM64_HAS_TLBI_BY_RANGE) && system_level_tlbi_by_range)
	flush_tlb_by_range()
else
	flush_tlb_range()

And this seems work for heterogeneous system (olny parts of the CPU support
TLBi by range) as well, correct me if anything wrong.

Thanks
Hanjun
