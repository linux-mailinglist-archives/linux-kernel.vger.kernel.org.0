Agreed.

It would be OK to have a separate example for (3).  It would of course
be nicer to have one example for all three, but not all -that- important.

That is indeed the classic canonical example.  ;-)

This is a great example, but it would need serious simplification for
use in the Documentation/RCU directory.  Note that dcache uses it to
gain very limited and targeted consistency -- only a few types of updates
acquire the write-side of that seqlock.

Might be quite worthwhile to have a simplified example, though!
Perhaps a trivial hash table where write-side sequence lock is acquired
only when moving an element from one chain to another?

Very good!
