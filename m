Right, you have to consider scope when sharing. The master should be the
largest scope event and any slaves should be complete subsets.

Without much thought this seems a fairly straight forward constraint;
that is, given cgroups I'm not immediately seeing how we can violate
that.

Basically, pick the cgroup event nearest to the root as the master.
We have to have logic to re-elect the master anyway for deletion, so
changing it on add shouldn't be different.

(obviously the root-cgroup is cpu-wide and always on, and if you have
two events from disjoint subtrees they have no overlap, so it doesn't
make sense to share anyway)
