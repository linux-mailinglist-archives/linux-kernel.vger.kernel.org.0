Hi Roman,

Correct. In particular, running some of the tests that ship with strace itself.
The performance change is so drastic, that it definitely makes you wonder
"What have I done wrong? Since everyone must be seeing this" .. and I
always blame myself first.

That would be great.

I'll attempt to remove all of the build system specifics out of this
(and Richard Purdie
on the cc' of this can probably help provide more details / setup info as well).

We are running the built-in tests of strace. So here's a cut and paste of what I
did to get the tests available (ignore/skip what is common sense or isn't needed
in your test rig).

% git clone https://github.com/strace/strace.git
% cd strace
% ./bootstrap
# the --enable flag isn't strictly required, but may break on some
build machines
% ./configure --enable-mpers=no
% make
% make check-TESTS

That last step will not only build the tests, but run them all .. so
^c the run once
it starts, since it is a lot of noise (we carry a patch to strace that
allows us to build
the tests without running them).

% cd tests
% time strace -o log -qq -esignal=none -e/clock ./printpath-umovestr > fff
real    0m2.566s
user    0m0.284s
sys     0m2.519

On pre-cgroup2 freezer kernels, you see a run time similar to what I have above.
On the newer kernels we are testing, it is taking 3 or 4 minutes to
run the test.

I hope that is simple enough to setup and try. Since I've been seeing
this on both
mainline kernels and the yocto reference kernels, I don't think it is
something that
I'm carrying in the distro/reference kernel that is causing this (but
again, I always
blame myself first). If you don't see that same run time, then that
does point the finger
back at what we are doing and I'll have to apologize for chewing up some of your
time.

Cheers,

Bruce
