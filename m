Let's take the example of 2 levels in addition to root so we have :
root->cfs1->cfs2
Now we enqueue a task T1 on cfs2 but cfs1 is throttled, we will have
the sequence:

In 1st for_each_sched_entity loop:
  loop 1
    enqueue_entity (T1->se, cfs2) which calls update load_avg(cfs2)
    cfs2->h_nr_running++;
  loop 2
    enqueue_entity (cfs2->gse, cfs1) which calls update load_avg(cfs1)
    break because cfs1 is throttled

In 2nd for_each_sched_entity loop:
  loop 1
    cfs1->h_nr_running++
    break because throttled

Using the 2nd loop for incrementing h_nr_running of the throttled cfs
is useless and we could do that directly in 1st loop and skip the 2nd
loop

With this patch we have :

In 1st for_each_sched_entity loop:
  loop 1
    enqueue_entity (T1->se, cfs2) which update load_avg(cfs2)
    cfs2->h_nr_running++;
  loop 2
    enqueue_entity (cfs2->gse, cfs1) which update load_avg(cfs1)
    cfs1->h_nr_running++
    skip the 2nd for_each_sched_entity entirely

Then the patch also reorders the call to update_load_avg() and the
increment of h_nr_running

Before the patch we had different order between the to
for_each_sched_entity which is not a problem because there is
currently no relation between both. But the following patches make
PELT using h_nr_running so we must have the same ordering to prevent
updating pelt with the wrong h_nr_running value
