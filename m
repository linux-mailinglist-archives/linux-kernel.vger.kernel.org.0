First there will be a lot of cases you'll just print 0, even
though 0 is canonical if there is no operand.

Then it might be that the address is canonical, but triggers
#GP anyways (e.g. unaligned SSE)

Or it might be the wrong address if there is an operand,
there are many complex instructions that reference something
in memory, and usually do canonical checking there.

And some other odd cases. For example when the instruction length
exceeds 15 bytes. I know there is fuzzing for the instruction
decoder, but it might be worth double checking it handles
all of that correctly. I'm not sure how good the fuzzer's coverage
is.

At a minimum you should probably check if the address is
actually non canonical. Maybe that's simple enough and weeds out
most cases.
