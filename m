request/free_irq() never allocate/free irq descriptors.

All PCI devices use some variant of request_irq()/free_irq(). The
interrupt descriptors are allocated by the underlying PCI
machinery. They are only allocated/freed when the device driver is
loaded/removed.

And this property exists for _ALL_ interrupts independent of PCI.

I think you want to explain:

  If an interrupt is released via free_irq() without removing the
  underlying irq descriptor, the interrupt count of the irq descriptor
  is not reset. /proc/interrupt shows such interrupts with an empty
  action handler name:
  
>            CPU0       CPU1
>  38:         46          0     GICv3  36 Level     ehci_hcd:usb1
>  39:         66          0     GICv3  37 Level

  irqbalance fails to detect that this interrupt is not longer in use
  and parses the last word in the line 'Level' as the action handler
  name.

Right, this is historic behaviour and I don't know how irqbalance dealt
with that in the past 20+ years. At least I haven't seen any complaints.

I'm not opposed to suppress the output, but I really want the opinion of
the irqbalance maintainers on that.

No, we can't. The historic behaviour is that the total interrupt count
for a device is maintained independent of the number of
request/free_irq() pairs.

I really can't remember that I have reviewed this patch already. Please
don't add tags which claim that some one has reviewed or acked your
patch unless you really got that Reviewed-by or Acked-by from that
person.

Thanks,
