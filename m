They may or they may not.  I do not know.  I am not going to audit all
current cases of devices being added to check that relationship and I am
not going to monitor all future patches that add devices.  Adding devices
is an existing pattern of behavior that the new feature must be able to
handle.

I have not looked at patch 6 yet (the place where modules adding child
devices is handled).  I am guessing that patch 6 could be made more
general to remove the parent child relationship restriction.

I am not talking about devices that are not defined in the devicetree.

No, you do not get to disagree on that.  And you are presenting a straw
man argument.

You are proposing a new feature that contributes fragility and complexity
to the house of cards that device instantiation and driver probing already
is.

The feature is clever but it is intertwined into an area that is already
complex and in many cases difficult to work within.

I had hoped that the feature was robust enough and generic enough to
accept.  The proposed feature is a hack to paper over a specific problem
that you are facing.  I had hoped that the feature would appear generic
enough that I would not have to regard it as an attempt to paper over
the real problem.  I have not given up this hope yet but I still am
quite cautious about this approach to addressing your use case.

You have a real bug.  I have told you how to fix the real bug.  And you
have ignored my suggestion.  (To be honest, I do not know for sure that
my suggestion is feasible, but on the surface it appears to be.)  Again,
my suggestion is to have the boot loader pass information to the kernel
(via a chosen property) telling the kernel which devices the bootloader
has enabled power to.  The power subsystem would use that information
early in boot to do a "get" on the power supplier (I am not using precise
power subsystem terminology, but it should be obvious what I mean).
The consumer device driver would also have to be aware of the information
passed via the chosen property because the power subsystem has done the
"get" on the consumer devices behalf (exactly how the consumer gets
that information is an implementation detail).  This approach is
more direct, less subtle, less fragile.

The Linux kernel is not just used by Android devices.
