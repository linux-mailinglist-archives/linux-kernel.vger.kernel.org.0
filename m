tools headers UAPI: Sync drm/i915_drm.h with the kernel

To pick up the changes from:

  d1172ab3d443 ("drm/i915: Introduce struct class_instance for engines across the uAPI")
  96fd2c6633b0 ("drm/i915: Drop new chunks of context creation ABI (for now)")
  ea593dbba4c8 ("drm/i915: Allow contexts to share a single timeline across all engines")
  b91715417244 ("drm/i915: Extend CONTEXT_CREATE to set parameters upon construction")
  e0695db7298e ("drm/i915: Create/destroy VM (ppGTT) for use with contexts")
  9d1305ef80b9 ("drm/i915: Introduce the i915_user_extension_method")
  c8b502422bfe ("drm/i915: Remove last traces of exec-id (GEM_BUSY)")
  d90c06d57027 ("drm/i915: Fix I915_EXEC_RING_MASK")
  e88619646971 ("drm/i915: Use HW semaphores for inter-engine synchronisation on gen8+")
  be03564bd7b6 ("drm/i915: Include reminders about leaving no holes in uAPI enums")
  ba4fda620a5f ("drm/i915: Optionally disable automatic recovery after a GPU reset")

We still don't take into account the _IOC_SIZE() to differentiate ioctl cmds,
so more work is needed to support the extension mechanism that is being used
here so that we can differentiate DRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_CONTEXT_CREATE from the
newly introduced DRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_CONTEXT_CREATE_EXT cmd.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/drm/i915_drm.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/drm/i915_drm.h'
