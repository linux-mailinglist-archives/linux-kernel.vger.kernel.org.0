This is pretty much what we had in mind when we suggested to the uCode teams.

Just a process of providing a meta data file to accompany every uCode release.

IMO new cpuid bits are probably less harmful than old ones dissappearing.

Maybe we can catch the kernel side in 20 years.. user space would still be 
busted, or have a fault way to control new cpuid much like how we do for
VM's.

This is 100% in line with what we proposed...
