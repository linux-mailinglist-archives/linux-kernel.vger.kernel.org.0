That's embarrassing. This was supposed to read:
long pidfd_getfd(int pidfd, int fd, struct pidfd_get_options *options,
size_t size);

I can think of at least two reasons we need flags:
* Clearing cgroup flags
* Closing the process under manipulation's FD when we fetch it.

The original reason for wanting to have two places where we can put
flags was to have a different field for fd flags vs. call flags. I'm not sure
there's any flags you'd want to set.

Given this, if we want to go down the route of a syscall, we should just
leave it as a __u64 flags, and drop the pointer to the struct, if we're
not worried about that.
