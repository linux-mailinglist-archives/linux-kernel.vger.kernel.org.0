Nope. This is layering violation here: The user of the resources is not
handling them in full.

How come? Can you show an example of output without and with your patches?

It's about slicing, no-one prevents you to do that. I don't see a problem.
Show the output!

Like Lee said, and I agree, nothing prevents us to switch to
platform_get_resource().

The stumbling block here is the *requesting* in parent which I strongly
disagree with (at least in a form of this change, I already told you, that this
has to be "fixed" on generic level, not as a hack in one certain driver).
