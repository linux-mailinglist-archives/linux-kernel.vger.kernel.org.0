Any progress on this ?

We have a bugreport in Mageia with the hw:
Dell Inspiron 5100, 32-bit P4 processor, 2GB of RAM, Radeon Mobility 
7500 (RV200) graphics

that gets display issues too and reverting the offending commit restores 
normal behaviour.

and the same issue is still there with 5.5 series kernels.
