The platform considers threads in H_CEDE to be active. It considers
threads that have performed stop-self to be inactive until they have
been restarted. The Thread Join Option section of the PAPR says active
threads must perform the H_JOIN. I have confirmed with hypervisor
development that this implies that the OS needn't involve inactive
threads in the join/suspend sequence.

It isn't quite explicit in the log for 120496ac2d2d ("powerpc: Bring all
threads online prior to migration/hibernation"), but it stands to reason
that using cede for offline is the reason that the code to online all
threads for join/suspend was introduced in the first place.
