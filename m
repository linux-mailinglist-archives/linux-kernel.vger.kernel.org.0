That might be better overall, you make a valid point that a failed
kmalloc is not a good sign for hugetlbfs allocations.

They can be big and while this particular path would be relatively safe,
I think the fact that there will not be much functional difference
between allocating on the stack and a failed kmalloc in terms of
hugetlbfs allocation success rates.
