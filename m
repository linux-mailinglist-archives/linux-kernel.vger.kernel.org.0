I need to read more on lockdep but it is legal to have mmu notifier
invalidation within each other. For instance when you munmap you
might split a huge pmd and it will trigger a second invalidate range
while the munmap one is not done yet. Would that trigger the lockdep
here ?

Worst case i can think of is 2 invalidate_range_start chain one after
the other. I don't think you can triggers a 3 levels nesting but maybe.

Cheers,
Jérôme
