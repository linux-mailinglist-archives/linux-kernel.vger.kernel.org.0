Thanks!

You can connect a USB4 device to Thunderbolt 3 system. USB4 hubs
specifically are required to support this by the spec. Of course then it
is in Thunderbolt 3 alternate mode (not in USB4 native mode) but the
USB4 register set is still there. So for example we still need to
configure TMU (Time Management Unit) and access the DROM via router
operations and so on.

Do you mean we don't want that?

Heh, sure and thanks for the feedback so far :)
