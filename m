I do think without this tasks can end up on the wrong CPU longer than they
should. Keep in mind that if a task is boosted to run on a big core, it still
have to compete with non-boosted tasks who can run on a any cpu. So this
opportunistic push might be necessary.

For 5.6 though, I'll send an updated series that removes the fitness check from
task_woken_rt() && switched_to_rt() and carry on with this discussion for 5.7.

Isn't this what I did in v1?
