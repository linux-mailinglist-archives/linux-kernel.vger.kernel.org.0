I don't think that uncached would work here either because the acpi
driver will have already mapped some of these regions as write-back
before this driver is loaded so the mapping will fail.

Perhaps the best way to make this work is to not call memremap at all
in the probe function but instead call memremap and memunmap every
time that data_read is called. memremap can take multiple caching mode
flags and will try each until one succeeds. So if you call it with
MEMREMAP_WB | MEMREMAP_WT in data_read it should succeed no matter how
it has been mapped by other drivers which should already be loaded
when it is called.
