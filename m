Well the problem is that the existing code took a shortcut and only 
modeled the slave part, e.g.

struct sdw_slave *slave = dev_to_sdw_dev(dev);

so now it's difficult to add 'sdw_slave_device' and 'sdw_master_device' 
without quite a few changes.

Would this work for you if we used the following names:

sdw_slave (legacy shortcut for sdw_slave_device, which could be removed 
in a a future cleanup if desired).
sdw_slave_driver
sdw_master_device
sdw_master_driver

and all the 'md' replaced by the full 'master_device'.
