Let me put my changelog pedant hat on; it would be nice to explicitely
separate the 'raw' stats (i.e. those that you are adding to sis()) to
the downstream ones.

AIUI the ones above here are the 'raw' stats (except "SIS Domain
Scanned", I'm not sure I get where this one comes from?), and the ones
below are the downstream, post-processed ones.

With the nits taken into account:

You may want to move that sis_scanned increment to below the 'symmetric'
label. Also, you should instrument select_idle_capacity() with
sis_scanned increments, if only for the sake of completeness.

One last thing: each of the new schedstat_inc() callsites use this_rq();
IIRC because of the RELOC_HIDE() hiding underneath there's very little
chance of the compiler caching this. However, this depends on schedstat,
so I suppose that is fine.
