This is contadicting. The "best" performance-wise solution was
choosen in favor of space. The next sentence says that performance
is not important.

I am more concerned about the size. Well, array of strings will
be both fast and size efficient.

I am not sure what are the expectations here. I can't imagine
another translation than:

   if (val == 1)
     str = "EPERM";
   else if (val == 2)
     str = "ENOENT"
   else if (val == 3)
     str = "ESRCH"
   ...

It means that all constans will be hardcoded in the code instead
of in data section. Plus there will be instructions for each
if/else part.

It seems that all people like this feature.

BTW: I though more about generating or cut&pasting the arrary.
I can't find any reasonable way how to generate it.

But both, errno.h and errno-base.h, are super stable. Only
comments were modified or new codes added. Most of them
are defined by POSIX so they should remain stable.

Therefore cut&pasted array of strings looks acceptable.
We should only allow to easily check numbers for each code,
e.g. by defining the array as

const err_str * [] {
	"0"			/*   0  Success */
	"EPERM",		/*   1	Operation not permitted */
	"ENOENT",		/*   2	No such file or directory */
	"ESRCH",		/*   3	No such process */
	...


If there is a hole, we could use something like:

	"-41",			/*  41  Skipped. EWOULDBLOCK is
	defined as EAGAIN.  Operation would block */

Petr
