- CPU Y might have already passed through its quiescent state for
  the current grace period, then disabled IRQs indefinitely.
  Now, CPU Y would block a later grace period, but CPU X is
  preventing the current grace period from ending, so no such
  later grace period can start.

Working on it!  Slow, I know!
