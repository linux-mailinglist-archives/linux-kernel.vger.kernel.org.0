okay, got it. thanks.

any other way to make it work ? GPIO ?
or just have some comments description here.
i.e,.

/* The NAND chip will exit the deep power down mode with #CS toggling, 
 * please refer to datasheet for the timing requirement of tCRDP and tRDP.
 */

it's timing requirement tCRDP 20 ns(min) to release device
from deep power-down mode. 
You may download datasheet at
https://www.macronix.com/zh-tw/products/NAND-Flash/SLC-NAND-Flash/Pages/spec.aspx?p=MX30LF4G28AD&m=SLC%20NAND&n=PM2579
