Care to elaborate what does that mean? I am confused on if you finally agree on
no printk() while held zone->lock or not. You said "If there is absolutely
no way around that then we might have to bite a bullet and consider some
of MM locks a land of no printk." which makes me think you agreed, but your
stance from the last reply seems you were opposite to it.
