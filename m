Maybe I can bring some clarity to the discussion.  I hope I do not muddy 
things.

My interest in this series is I am developing a kernel driver for a 
product which uses MHI.  Unfortunately I am currently under embargo, 
otherwise I would post an RFC of my kernel driver which uses this 
series.  Let me try to dance around the embargo issue to hopefully 
illustrate how I aim to use this series.

Note that I expect my usecase is not the "defining" usecase.  I fully 
expect other usecases to exist.  IE what I hope to explain is not to be 
taken as the "one true way" to use MHI.

At the physical layer, my product is attached to a PCIE bus.  Thus my 
driver registers as a PCI driver for a device containing a specific 
VID/PID.  My product uses MHI as the "control path".  When I want to 
give commands to my product, they occur via the MHI protocol.  The "data 
path" occurs outside of MHI, and thus there is direct access to that 
hardware via PCIE.

In my usecase, my driver acts as both MHI Controller, and also MHI 
Client Driver.  Based on the PCIE device probe, my driver registers a 
MHI Controller.  Its going to be important for me that I have some means 
of associating the MHI Controller instance to the PCIE device instance 
(struct device) so that I can then correlate MHI devices to the PCIE 
device (more on that in a bit).  Right now, since the MHI controller 
essentially reuses the struct device from the PCIE device (provided by 
my driver), I can do that.

My MHI Controller exposes a number of channels, but for this discussion, 
the relevant one is the "control" channel.

My kernel driver also registers a MHI Client Driver which binds to this 
control channel.  Since its possible to have multiple instances of my 
product, I need to make a connection between the specific control 
channel device that my MHI Client Driver has probed on, and the PCIE 
device this control channel runs on so that I can store this connection 
in my struct that is in the driver data of the struct device of the pci 
device.  With that connection made, I can then correlate activity on the 
control MHI channel for a particular device with the services that my 
driver provides.

So, what we have, in my case, is a layering of buses, and its important 
to be able to identify the relationships (ie this particular MHI bus is 
associated with this particular PCI device on the PCI bus).

As I said, currently since the MHI bus is reusing the PCI struct device, 
its possible for my driver to make these connections as necessary.  If 
the MHI bus needs to have its own struct device instance, then how do 
you propose those connections be determined?  The MHI bus device is a 
child of the PCI device (thus from the MHI bus device, we dereference 
its parent)?
