Thank you for your advice. We also discussed earlier and concluded
that checking and raw remapping are enough to work around this. The
link is here, https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/29/962 .

I didn't know about that. I just found the case from your thread that
AMD system assigned TPM region into the reserved area. However, as I
know, the reserved area has no busy bit so that TPM CRB driver could
assign buffer resources in it. Right? In my view, if you patched your
TPM driver with my patch series, then it could work. Would you explain
what happened in TPM CRB driver and reserved area?

As you know, the original code trusts the ACPI table because of the
workaround for broken BIOS, and this code has worked well for a long
time. In my view, if we change this code to trust control register
value, we could make new problems and need a lot of time to check the
workaround. So, I want to trust the ACPI value now.

I know about that. However, the device driver is not going to read and
write 4K buffers if you patch your TPM driver with my patch series.
One of my patches has an enhancement feature that could calculate the
buffer size well. The TPM driver uses exactly 1K buffer for this case,
not 4K buffer, and it works.
