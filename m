I gave your solution a try.
It only enables the reset-on-next-patch feature when using stdin.
Thanks to the printed subject, it's now obvious to which patch a
message applies to.
However, the output is significantly different than when passing
a split patch series.  Can this be improved upon?

Note that the only reason I'm using stdin is that I use formail to split
a bundle in individual patches.  Once checkpatch supports bundles (or
mboxes) containing multiple patches, there's no longer a need for
using formail, and the reset-on-next-patch feature should be
enabled unconditionally.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
