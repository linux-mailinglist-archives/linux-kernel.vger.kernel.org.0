I can be persuaded about just the vmalloc check as people tend to get
a lot of vmalloc alloctions without knowing these days.  But what I'd
really like to see is a new config option that enables relatively
cheap checks without the full dma debugging infrastructure.  That way
you can turn those on at least for all development builds, and can
easily benchmark having the checks vs not.
