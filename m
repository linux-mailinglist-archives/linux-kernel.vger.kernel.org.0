Thanks, Michal.

I't likde to wait Jann's reply since Dave gave his opinion about the vulnerability.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/cf95db88-968d-fee5-1c15-10d024c09d8a@intel.com/
Jann, could you give your insigh about that practically it's possible?

A real dumb question to understand vulnerability:

The attacker would be able to trigger heavy memory consumption so that he
could make paging them out without MADV_PAGEOUT. I know MADV_PAGEOUT makes
it easier but he still could do without MADV_PAGEOUT.
What makes difference here?

To clarify how MADV_PAGEWORK works:
If other process has accessed the page so that his page table has access
bit marked, MADV_PAGEOUT couldn't page it out.

I am not sure it's a good idea to mention performance stuff because
it's rather arguble. You and Johannes already pointed it out when I sbumit
early draft which had shared page filtering out logic due to performance
reason. You guys suggested the shared pages has higher chance to be touched
so that if it's really hot pages, that whould keep in the memory. I agree.

I think the only reason at this moment is just vulnerability.

How about this?
/*
 * paging out only single mapped private pages for anonymous mapping,
 * otherwise, it opens a side channel.
 */

Otherwise, looks good to me.
