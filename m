Your statement is incorrect. We are not nitpicking about words. I am
trying to clarify what you are misunderstanding.

@id _is_ very important because that is how descriptors are
read. desc_read() takes @id as an argument and it is @id that identifies
the descriptor. @seq is only meta-data within a descriptor. The only
reason @seq is even checked is because of possible ABA issues with @id
on 32-bit systems.

I am sorry for the confusion. In preparation for v2 I have changed the
function description to:

/*
 * Get a copy of a specified descriptor and verify that the record is
 * committed and has the sequence number @seq. @seq is checked because
 * of possible ABA issues with @id on 32-bit systems. On success, 0 is
 * returned.
 *
 * Error return values:
 * -EINVAL: A committed record @seq does not exist.
 * -ENOENT: The record @seq exists, but its data is not available. This is a
 *          valid record, so readers should continue with the next seq.
 */

This is using the same language as the description of desc_read() so
that is it is hopefully clear that desc_read_committed() is an extended
version of desc_read().

0 cannot be returned. The state is checked. Please let us stop this
bug/non-bug discussion. It is distracting us from clarifying this
function and refactoring it to simplify understanding.

@id is set during prb_reserve(). @seq (being mere meta-data) is set
_afterwards_. Your proposed multiple-deriving of @id from @seq would
work because the _state checks_ would catch it, not because @seq would
necessarily change.

But that logic is backwards. @seq is not what is important here. It is
only meta-data. On 64-bit systems the @seq checks could be safely
removed.

You may want to refer back to your private email [0] from last November
where you asked me to move this code out of prb_read() and into a helper
function. That may clarify what we are talking about (although I hope
the new function description is clear enough).
