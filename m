Which is the default setting for that, so that's not the issue.

I think one reason could be, in_irq() is false when the timer callback
executes, since the timer callback is executing after a grace-period. The
stack is as follows:

Any reason why we cannot both test for call_rcu() and execute the RCU
callback from the timer hardirq handler?

In fact, I guess on use_nosoftirq systems, the callback will not even run
in softirq context.

[   20.553361]  => rcu_torture_timer_cb
[   20.553361]  => rcu_do_batch
[   20.553361]  => rcu_core
[   20.553361]  => __do_softirq
[   20.553361]  => do_softirq_own_stack
[   20.553361]  => do_softirq.part.16
[   20.553361]  => __local_bh_enable_ip
[   20.553361]  => rcutorture_one_extend
[   20.553361]  => rcu_torture_one_read
[   20.553361]  => rcu_torture_reader
[   20.553361]  => kthread
[   20.553361]  => ret_from_fork
