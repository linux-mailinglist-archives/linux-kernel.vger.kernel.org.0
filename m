It will still be enabled. I am not changing that. The main issue would
be if the match callback chokes on being called multiple times.

IE. The only change in behaviour I think with my patch is who gets to
be the default, ie who gets to be first in the list with CONSDEV set.
There should be no change in who gets enabled.

This looks indeed a lot more invasive. Is there any reason why what I
propose wouldn't work as a first patch that can easily be backported ?

I don't see how it would break anything but I haven't necessarily fully
understood everything the driver match callbacks might be doing...

We can continue cleaning up from there of course, but I'd be keen on
having a minimal fix that can go back to stable first.

I'll give it a spin. However I don't fully grasp why it's necessarily
so complicated. Correct me if I'm wrong here but you are trying to
address two issues in that patch:

 - The one I'm trying to address which is that we might "miss" the
preferred console in the case of multiple matches.

 - The fact that when the preferred console isn't found, the one we
default to (which ends up first in the list) is missing CONSDEV.

Or am I missing something here ?

Now couldnt we just use a combination of my patch and one that sets
CONSDEV on the first enabled console if not set at the end of
register_console ?

If later on the preferred one comes in, it will be inserted first with
CONSDEV and the flag will be removed from the previous first unless I
misread the code.

Cheers,
Ben.
