Subject: [PATCH 0/2] panic/printk/x86: Prevent some more printk-related deadlocks in panic()

Hi,

I have found some spare duct tape and wrapped some more printk-related
deadlocks in panic().

More seriously, someone reported a deadlock in panic(). Some non-trivial
debugging pointed out a problem with the following combination:

     + x86_64 architecture
     + panic()
     + pstore configured as message dumper (kmsg_dump())
     + crash kernel configured
     + crash_kexec_post_notifiers

In this case, CPUs are stopped by crash_smp_send_stop(). It uses
NMI but it does not modify cpu_online_mask. Therefore logbuf_lock
might stay locked, see 2nd patch for more details.

The above is a real corner case. But similar problem seems to be
even in the common situations on architectures that do not use
NMI in smp_send_stop() as a fallback, see 1st patch.

Back to the duct tape. I hope that we will get rid of these problems
with the lockless printk ringbuffer rather sooner than later.
But it still might take some time. And the two fixes might be
useful also for stable kernels.


Petr Mladek (2):
  printk/panic: Access the main printk log in panic() only when safe
  printk/panic/x86: Allow to access printk log buffer after
    crash_smp_send_stop()
