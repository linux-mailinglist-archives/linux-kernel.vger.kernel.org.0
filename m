Yes, I didn't touch anything here. and it indeed expected since the
bus and reset line goes disabled and asserted.

No, value is not stick. what ever I wrote on on 0x1c70020 it is not taking.

I understand it, the for accessing tcon space we have bus and reset
line to be enabled and desserted. But the thing is I didn't see any
difference in the behavior even If I enable or deassert the bus and
reset in probe or in bind.

The devmem numbers which I have listed above is same for both the
cases, one with this patch and another one is handle via probe

Sure, please.

Got it, thanks.
