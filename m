Hi Greg,

Thank you for looking at it.

Below example is simplified description. Our detail problem is:
1. ACPI driver registers a MEM resource during bootup;
2. Our PUNIT(Intel CPU power management module) platform device reads ACPI driver's resource, and registers same MEM resource;
3. According to current resource management logic, if two resources are same, later registered resource will be parent. That is, PUNIT platform device's resource will be ACPI driver resource's parent.
4. PUNIT kernel module is removed, its resource will be removed. If we use original API "release_resource", ACPI driver's resource will be released as well because it is PUNIT device's child;
5. Next time PUNIT platform device kernel module is inserted, it might read wrong ACPI MEM resource because it has been released in step 4.

How should we handle this case? :) 
We should not register same MEM resource in step 2? Or, make change in resource management logic, if two resources are same, later registered resource should be child instead of parent?

Thanks,
Junxiao

But shouldn't the parent device not get removed until all of the children are removed?  What is causing this "inversion" to happen?

Don't do that.  :)

You created this mess of platform devices, so you need to keep track of them.

Why not fix that kernel module instead?  It seems like that is the real problem here, not a driver core issue.

thanks,
