Right. The thing also lacks PIT :)

So there are two options:

   1) Make sure the HPET is parsed somehow even with the reduced stuff

   2) Make the clock frequency detection work.

#1 is a trainwreck

#2 is something we really want to have anyway. See the other reply. I cc'ed
   Tom there, he should be able to give us the missing link.

Thanks,
