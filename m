  through the IA32....CONTROL MSR.

MSR register, IOW: Machine Specific Register register.

What has MSR_TEST_CTL to do with this?

Why is this not following the umwait_ namespace as everything else?

Huch? How does umwait_control_cached complete its WRMSR?

How would that happen? If this is called from a hotplugged CPU then that
CPU cannot handle sysfs writes even if the hotplug thread on which this
runs is preempted. The CPU is not marked active yet and cannot schedule
user space tasks. Doing the wrmsr(MSR, READ()) preemptible would just make
the race window larger.

  will not finish updating us?

That local_irq_save() belongs into the cpu hotplug callback and there it
wants to be a local_irq_disable(). The IPI runs already with interrupts
disabled. And that comment wants to be in the hotplug function as well.

With that you can also spare the indirection via that extra IPI function
below and just add the void *unused argument to this and invoke it from the
hotplug callback with NULL.

Eeew. !(bool)....

Your naming conventions are inconsistent. The file is named 'enable', which
is fine, but here you read the written value into a variable named 'enabled'

How many of those comments do we need?

Umpf.

And how often do we need to read that cached value? Why not doing the
obvious, read the ctrl value once and then work from there.

    	ctrl = READ_ONCE(umwait_control_cached);

        if (c02_enable == umwait_c02_enabled(ctrl))
                goto out_unlock;

        ctrl = umwait_max_time(ctrl);
        if (!c02_enable)
                ctrl |= MSR_IA32_UMWAIT_CONTROL_C02_DISABLE;

        WRITE_ONCE(umwait_control_cached, ctrl);

That does not need any comment about the inverted bit and whatever. It's
just clear what it does. The only place where this comment is required is
in umwait_c02_enabled() which returns the enabled state from the control
value argument as boolean. That makes also the weird type casts go away.

When that fails then all CPUs have some random possibly nonsensical value
in the control MSR, whatever the firmware or reset default set it to.

Not that it matters much, because boot will probably not work at all, but
you can spare the removal below, when you move that sysfs thing to the very
end. And it makes more sense that way.
