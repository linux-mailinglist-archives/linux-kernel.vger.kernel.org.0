FWIW, I've always considered the WP pin as a way to protect against
spurious destructive command emission, which is most likely to happen
during transition phases (bootloader -> linux, linux -> kexeced-linux,
platform reset, ..., or any other transition where the pin state might
be undefined at some point). This being said, if you're worried about
other sources of spurious cmds (say your bus is shared between
different kind of memory devices, and the CS pin is unreliable), you
might want to leave the NAND in a write-protected state de-asserting WP
only when explicitly issuing a destructive command (program page, erase
block).
