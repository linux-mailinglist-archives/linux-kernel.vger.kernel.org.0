I believe that your assertion that only platform devices want to
install custom attributes is incorrect. Drivers for devices attached
to serio, i2c, USB, spi, etc, etc, all have additional attributes:

dtor@dtor-ws:~/kernel/work (master *)$ grep -l '\(i2c\|usb\|spi\)'
`git grep -l '\(device_add_group\|sysfs_create_group\)' -- drivers` |
wc -l
170

I am pretty sure some of this count is false positives, but majority
is actually proper hits.

Not for the new functionality, I do not think so. Newer kernels should
be compatible with older userspace as it not breaking it, but new
functionality is not guaranteed to be available with older userspace.

Thanks.
