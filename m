nit: the first 3 patch subject lines should probably be prefixed with
"libceph:"

Yes, this needs to be done with care. We have to ensure that the server
side isn't assuming that the client supports something that it doesn't.
I think that means just trawling through the code and verifying whether
this is safe.

I'm just getting caught up on the discussion here, but why was it
decided to do it this way instead of just adding a new OSD
"copy-from-no-truncseq" operation? Once you tried it once and an OSD
didn't support it, you could just give up on using it any longer? That
seems a lot simpler than trying to monkey with feature bits.
