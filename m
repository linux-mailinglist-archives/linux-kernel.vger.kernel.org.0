These two I understand

If fw_name is provided, you have everything you need to get the clock, why the ?

If both fw_name and index are provided, how do you perform the look up ? using
the index ? or the fw_name ?

And now its me not following :)

In the case I presenting, I only defined the (legacy) name because that we want
to use. In another thread, I'll explain the particular problem that make us use
this legacy name, I just to dont want to over complicate this topic now.

Sure but it is still a bit ugly and un-intuitive. If I only defined the legacy
name, it's pretty obvious that what I want to use ... I should not have to
insist :)

And again the fact that (legacy) .name is silently discarded if index is not
defined, but .hw or .fw_name are taken into account no matter what is not
consistent

You'll try to look up the legacy name only if it is defined, in which case you
know you this is what you want to use, so I don't see the penalty.  Unless ...

Are trying to support case where multiple fields among hw, name, fw_name, index
would be defined simultaneously ??

IMO, it would be weird and very confusing.

Maybe it just solve the problem, I don't fully understand its implication. I
might need to try it, and see

digressing a bit ...

I don't remember seeing the index field in the initial review of your series ?
what made you add this ?

Isn't it simpler to mandate the use of the clock-names property ? Referring to
the clock property by index is really weak and should discouraged IMO.
