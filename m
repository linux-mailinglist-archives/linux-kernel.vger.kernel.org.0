This gap looks too big wrt. threaded interrupts vs. interrupts.

In theory, it shouldn't be so because most of times the thread should be running
on CPUs of this hctx, and the wakeup cost shouldn't be so big. Maybe there is
performance problem somewhere wrt. threaded interrupt.

Could you share us your test script and environment? I will see if I can
reproduce it in my environment.

I don't see why IRQF_IRQ_AFFINITY is needed.

John, could you explain it a bit why you need changes on IRQF_IRQ_AFFINITY? 

The following patch should be enough:

diff --git a/kernel/irq/manage.c b/kernel/irq/manage.c
index e8f7f179bf77..1e7cffc1c20c 100644
--- a/kernel/irq/manage.c
