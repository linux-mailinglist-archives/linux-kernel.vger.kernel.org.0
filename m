Minimizing is not something that happens in a void. Given the user base
for the SDK having the handler was a necessity. Otherwise, we would not
have that handler in the first place.

OK, great.

I was not aware that there was a plot to make it callable by C.

OK, so right now

A. @leaf =  %eax
B. @tcs = 8(%rsp)
C. @e = 0x10(%rsp)
D. @handler = 0x18(%rsp)

On x86-64 Linux C calling convention means DI/SI/DX/CX type of thing.

So what is the thing that we are referring to C calling convetion in
this email discussion?

Is it cool if I rip of the documentation from vsgx_enter_enclave.S and
move it to Documentation/ ? It is nasty to keep and update it where it
is right now. How it is right now, it is destined to rotten.
