But as you have pointed out many people are happy with current OOM processing
which is the report and recovery so for those people a kdump reboot is overkill.
Making the OOM report at least optionally a bit more informative has value. Also
making sure it doesn't produce excessive output is desirable.

I do agree for developers having to have all the system state a kdump
provides that
and as long as you can reproduce the OOM event that works well. But
that is not the
common case as has already been discussed.

Also, OOM events that are due to kernel bugs could leak memory and over time
and cause a crash, true. But that is not what we typically see. In
fact we've had
customers come back and report issues on systems that have been in continuous
operation for years. No point in crashing their system. Linux if
properly maintained
is thankfully quite stable. But OOMs do happen and root causing them to prevent
future occurrences is desired.
