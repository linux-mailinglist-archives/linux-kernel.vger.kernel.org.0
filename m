I'd go even further, considering that any task having called ioperm()
or iopl() once is granted access to all 64k ports for life: if the task
was granted access to any port, it will be able to request access for any
other port anyway. And we cannot claim that finely filtering accesses
brings any particular reliability in my opinion, considering that it's
generally possible to make the system really sick by starting to play
with most I/O ports. So for me that becomes a matter of trusted vs not
trusted task. Then we can simply have two pages of 0xFF to describe
their I/O access bitmap.

You mean you'd have a unified map for all tasks ? In this case I think
it's simpler and equivalent to simply ignore the values in the calls
and grant full perms to the 64k ports range after the calls were
validated. I could be totally wrong and missing something obvious
though.
