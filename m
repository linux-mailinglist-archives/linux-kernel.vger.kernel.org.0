From: Haiyan Song <haiyanx.song@intel.com>

New Metrics:

- DSB_Switches: fraction of cycles CPU was stalled due to switches from DSB to MITE pipeline [all]
- L2_Evictions_{Silent|NonSilent}_PKI: L2 {silent|non silent} ecivtions rate per Kilo instruction [SKX+]
- IpFarBranch - Instructions per Far Branch

Other Enhancements & fixes:

- KBLR/CFL & CLX move to separate columns (no column sharing via if #model)
- Re-organized/renamed Metric Group

Frontend denotes the first part of the processor core responsible to fetch operations that are executed later on by the Backend part.

Ideally the Frontend can issue 4 uops every cycle to the Backend. Frontend Bound denotes unutilized issue-slots when there is no Backend stall; i.e. bubbles where Frontend delivered no uops while Backend could have accepted them.

Frontend denotes the first part of the processor core responsible to fetch operations that are executed later on by the Backend part. Within the Frontend; a branch predictor predicts the next address to fetch; cache-lines are fetched from the memory subsystem; parsed into instructions; and lastly decoded into micro-ops (uops). Ideally the Frontend can issue 4 uops every cycle to the Backend. Frontend Bound denotes unutilized issue-slots when there is no Backend stall; i.e. bubbles where Frontend delivered no uops while Backend could have accepted them. For example; stalls due to instruction-cache misses would be categorized under Frontend Bound. SMT version; use when SMT is enabled and measuring per logical CPU."
