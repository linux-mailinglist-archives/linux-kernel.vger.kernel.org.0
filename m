For the benefit of people not watching GitHub SBI spec comments, here
are my comments as replied on GitHub as well.

isn't what you want for remote fences.

The blocking nature of remote TLB flushes is as-per expectation of
Linux kernel and it is also true for IPI based remote TLB flushes.
In trying to fix Glibc craches with OpenSBI (six months back), we
realized that non-blocking remote TLB flushes with SBI calls (or with
IPIs) causes Linux kernel to crash because if we return before TLBs
on other HARTs are updated then other HARTs can potentially do invalid
access using stale TLB enteries. Due to this reason, on architecutures
(such as ARM64) with ISA support for remote TLB flush, the remote TLB
flush instructions are defined as blocking. The IPI based remote TLB
flushes for x86_64 is also blocking.
(Refer, https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/mm/tlb.c#L70=
8)

> IIRC we'd decided at the Zurich workshop to stop speculatively defining S=
BI extensions until we had a corresponding ISA extension that would make th=
em somehow better to implement in M-mode than in S-mode, and I think this e=
xtension is a good one to wait on.

IIRC, (at Zurich workshop 2019) we had decided to keep remote TLB flush
calls as optional (and not remove it) so that in-future an ISA extension
can be defined and preferred over SBI call.

The rational for above (as discussed at Zurich workshop 2019) is:

1. If we don't have SBI extension and ISA extension for remote TLB
flush then Guest/VM don't have any way for remote TLB flushes. A
software emulated MMIO CLINT for Guest/VM is not a viable option
because to inject IPI to N HARTs we need to do N MMIO writes where
each MMIO write will be trap-n-emulated. This will be very slow
and not at all scalable for any hypervisor.

2. In absence of S-mode CLINT and remote TLB flush ISA extension,
the IPI based remote TLB flush will be quite slow compared to SBI
calls because each IPI call will again go through SBI call. We had
proven this fact using benchmarks as well. In fact, this performance
difference was discussed in Linux kernel mailing list long time back
(Refer https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10872349/). The newer SBI
RFENCE calls are even better than SBI v0.1 RFENCE calls because we
are avoiding unpriv access so with these new calls we will get even
better performance compared to IPI based remote TLB flushes.

3. The SBI extension for remote TLB flush does not remove the
possibility of defining an ISA extension in-future. In fact,
in-future the Linux kernel will decide at runtime on method to
use for remote TLB flushes as follows:
 a) First check if an ISA extension for remote TLB flush is
    available. If available then use it otherwise try step b
 b) Next check if S-mode CLINT is available. If available then
    use IPI based remote TLB flush otherwise try step c
 c) Lastly check if SBI RFENCE extension is available. If
    available then use it otherwise try step d
 d) We don't have any method for remote TLB flush so crash.

to the ABI, which allows us to experiment more freely and ideally figure ou=
