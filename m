Looks like the leading spaces after the backslash are included in the
string. Something like this should be better:

        DRM_WARN_ONCE("Warning: check cp_fw_version and update "
                      "GRBM requires 1-cycle delay in cp firmware\n");

(or maybe the intention was to put the second sentence on a new line?)
