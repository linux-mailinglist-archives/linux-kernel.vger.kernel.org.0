Correct, SCMI is implemented in part within the trusted firmware (it is
not ATF, something custom), and in part using an external processor for
specific tasks.

Sure that's fine, the point we all seem to agree upon is that putting
provision in the binding document for an optional interrupt is already
known to be desirable.
