This is important information. I havn't seen it mentioned earlier.

With the more stuff you mean the lockdep splat? If yes, it might
make sense to call debug_locks_off() earlier in panic().

Your patch might remove the particular lockdep splat. It might be
worth it (Peter mentioned also an optimization effect). Anyway
it will not prevent the deadlock.

The only way to avoid the deadlock is to use printk_deferred()
with the current printk() code.


Finally, I have recently worked on similar problem with dying system.
I sent the following patch for testing. I wonder if it might be
acceptable upstream:


From: Petr Mladek <pmladek@suse.com>
Subject: sched/x86: Do not warn about offline CPUs when all are being stopped
Patch-mainline: No, just for testing
References: bsc#1104406

The warning about rescheduling offline CPUs cause dealock when
the CPUs need to get stopped using NMI. It might happen with
logbuf_lock, locks used by console drivers, especially tty.
But it might also be caused by a registered kernel message
dumper, for example, pstore.

The warning is pretty common when there is a high load and
CPUs are being stopped by native_stop_other_cpus(). But
they are not really useful in this context. And they scrolls
the really important messages off the screen.

We need to fix printk() in the long term. But disabling
the message looks reasonable at least in the meantime.
