I have some questions about the rationale for the design ...

Why is this not sufficient?

In my implementation, I create a lookup table at the attestation service 
that maps the 4-byte IMA log key identifier to the signing public key.

Are you concerned about collisions?  Something else?

Are you suggesting that the client supply the verification public key 
and that the verifier trust it?  Wouldn't that make the log self signed?

How would the verifier determine that the key from the IMA log is valid 
/ trusted / not revoked from the log itself?

If the verifier has the list of valid keys, why must they also come with 
the IMA log?

A minor question here.

Are you proposing that the IMA log contain a single ima-sigkey entry per 
public key followed by ima-sig entries?

Or are you proposing that ima-sig be replaced by ima-sigkey, and that 
each event would contain both the signature and the public key?

If the latter, this could add 25M to a server's 100K log.  Would that 
increase in size concern anyone?  Could it be a concern on the other 
end, an IoT device with limited memory?
