I am not sure this is correct

ACPI defines the slaves devices under
/sys/bus/acpi/PRP0001, e.g.

/sys/bus/acpi/devices/PRP00001:00/device:17# ls
adr                                 mipi-sdw-dp-5-sink-subproperties
intel-endpoint-descriptor-0         mipi-sdw-dp-6-source-subproperties
intel-endpoint-descriptor-1         mipi-sdw-dp-7-sink-subproperties
mipi-sdw-dp-0-subproperties         mipi-sdw-dp-8-source-subproperties
mipi-sdw-dp-1-sink-subproperties    path
mipi-sdw-dp-1-source-subproperties  physical_node
mipi-sdw-dp-2-sink-subproperties    power
mipi-sdw-dp-2-source-subproperties  subsystem
mipi-sdw-dp-3-sink-subproperties    uevent
mipi-sdw-dp-4-source-subproperties

but the sysfs for slaves is shown as
/sys/bus/acpi/devices/PRP00001:00/int-sdw.0/sdw:0:25d:700:0:0# ls
bank_delay_support  master_count             sink_ports
ch_prep_timeout     mipi_revision            source_ports
clk_stop_mode1      modalias                 src-dp2
clk_stop_timeout    p15_behave               src-dp4
dp0                 paging_support           subsystem
driver              power                    test_mode_capable
firmware_node       reset_behave             uevent
hda_reg             simple_clk_stop_capable  wake_capable
high_PHY_capable    sink-dp1
index_reg           sink-dp3

and in sys/bus/soundwire/devices/sdw:0:25d:700:0:0# ls
bank_delay_support  master_count             sink_ports
ch_prep_timeout     mipi_revision            source_ports
clk_stop_mode1      modalias                 src-dp2
clk_stop_timeout    p15_behave               src-dp4
dp0                 paging_support           subsystem
driver              power                    test_mode_capable
firmware_node       reset_behave             uevent
hda_reg             simple_clk_stop_capable  wake_capable
high_PHY_capable    sink-dp1
index_reg           sink-dp3

So I would think we *do* create a new device for each slave instead of 
using the one that's already exposed by ACPI.

yes, that's agreed.
