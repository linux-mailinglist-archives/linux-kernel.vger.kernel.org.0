I'm still seeing no improvement with kfree_bulk().

I've been thinking I could see improvement with kfree_bulk() because:

   1. As you guys said, the number of cache misses will be reduced.
   2. We can save (N - 1) irq-disable instructions while N kfrees.
   3. As Joel said, saving/restoring CPU status that kfree() does inside
      is not required.

But even with the following patch applied, the result was same as just
batching test. We might need to get kmalloc objects from random
addresses to maximize the result when using kfree_bulk() and this is
even closer to real practical world too.

And the second and third reasons doesn't seem to work as much as I
expected.

Do you have any idea? Or what do you think about it?

Thanks,
Byungchul
