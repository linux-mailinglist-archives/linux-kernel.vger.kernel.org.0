Then it would be good to think about how that should look. Maybe
there's overlap or maybe not.

It's a single new property rather than a whole binding for a virtual
device. It's a minimal change to the DT. It would work with existing
bootloaders (and other OSs and older kernels) without change except
for the one concatenated partition.

I'd prefer to not have virtual devices without good reason.
