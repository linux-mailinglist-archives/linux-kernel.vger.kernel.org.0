Yeah, right, the question is, which commit to put in there. The problem
results from two changes:

	1) Introduction of !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD path in x86-32. In itself
	   this is not a problem, and the path was only enabled for
	   Xen-PV.

	2) Huge IORemapings which use the PMD level. Also not a problem
	   by itself, but together with !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD problematic
	   because it requires to sync the PMD entries between all
	   page-tables, and that was not implemented.

Before PTI-x32 was merged this problem did not show up, maybe because
the 32-bit Xen-PV users did not trigger it. But with PTI-x32 all PAE
users run with !SHARED_KERNEL_PMD and the problem popped up.

For the last patch I put the PTI-x32 enablement commit in the fixes tag,
because that was the one that showed up during bisection. But more
correct would probably be

	5d72b4fba40e ('x86, mm: support huge I/O mapping capability I/F')

Or do I miss something?

Regards,

	Joerg
