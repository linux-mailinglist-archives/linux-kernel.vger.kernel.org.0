I've roughly compared the performance between libunwind-dev and 
libdw-dev. While in my test (on KBL desktop), for the same perf report 
command-line, it looks the perf built with libunwind-dev is much faster 
than the perf built with libdw-dev.

The command line is as following:

perf record --call-graph dwarf ./div
perf report -g graph --stdio

Maybe you give it a try. :)
