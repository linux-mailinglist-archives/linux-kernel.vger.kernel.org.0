Thank you for your reply.

I guess, this patch has to be refactored to match the related linux
versions. And excuse me, my orignal hardware environments has been gone,
so I can not give the new refactored patch additional test.

It is necessary to continue discussing and reviewing this patch to let
it be known completely, but I guess I am not the suitable persion to
refactor the patch.

After finish discussing and reviewing, if anyone still wants me to
refactor the patch, please let me know, I shall try.

The contents below are my reply, pelease check, thanks.

OK, thanks.

OK. I guess, originally, I forgot to remove it.

It'll be OK.

In my case at that time, for fintex irq sharing, it needed additional
initinalization, or it could not work well. I wrote the related code
based on the fintek data-sheet which was downloaded from internet.

I thought locating the main probe function at the end of the source file
was better for normal code reading (maybe it need be a seperate patch).
But if we don't mind, we can still remain its orignal position.

At that time, for me, I could not get any new better ways in a short
time, and the issue had to be fixed in time, so the code was not good
engough.

At present, Linux version has been changed much, welcome any one to
refactor it for current linux version or another related old linux
versions if this patch is valuable more or less.


Thanks.
