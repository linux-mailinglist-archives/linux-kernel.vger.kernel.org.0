Seems that all the caller sites you've converted use a fairly small
number of rbnodes, so the additional storage shouldn't be a big
problem.  Are there any other sites you're eyeing?  If so, do you expect
any of those will use a significant amount of memory for the nodes?

And...  are these patches really worth merging?  Complexity is added,
but what end-user benefit can we expect?
