Well, the dt bindings stuff is still being discussed:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11248783/

Also, looking at this again, the patch authorship looks really fishy:

Sender is

From: Shiping Ji <shiping.linux@gmail.com>

however, he doesn't have his SOB in there and previous iterations were
done with Lei Wang whose SOB *is* there so I dunno what's going on.

*Especially* if Lei Wang is being added as a maintainer of that driver
by the second patch but he's not sending this driver himself. If this
driver is going to be orphaned the moment it lands upstream, I'm not
going to take it.

So at least those two things need to be fixed/clarified first.

HTH.
