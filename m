It's been ~2 years since I looked at this code in detail, but IIRC, it
looked like the inc-from-zero check was missing from the x86
implementation because it requires a load/compare/increment/store
sequence instead of a single increment instruction taking a memory
operand. Was there more rationale at the time for omitting this
particular case, and if so, was it based on a benchmark? Can we run it
against this implementation as well?
