The last part is only true, if you don't let MFD manage the memory
resources, which is the main thing that MFD is doing.

As an example, the sm501.c driver, the only driver in drivers/mfd/ which
uses serial8250 driver, does not use any code from mfd-core.
Incidentally, it is 1 year older than mfd-core.c, and as never been
refactored to use mfd-core functionality.

Why we cannot use request_mem_region() for those memory resources again?
It fails because the resources are now already owned the mfd driver, on
behalf of the child.

I still think there is some confusion in relation to your use of the
word "requesting".  There is no explicit request/lock action in
kernel/resource.c.

There are basically only two steps involved in resource management in
kernel/resource.c:
1. You create a struct resource.
2. You add it to the child list of another resource.

Requesting a reasource is just another word for 2.  And
request_mem_region() is just a that, hardcoded to the iomem_resource
struct.

And mfd_add_device() implements step 2 for the resources included in the
cell.resources field.  The purpose is a generic resource slicing
implementation, and is also what you call requesting.

No.  It is not working.

Why are you saying that?  There is no existing usage of the serial8250
driver in combination of mfd_add_devices().  And it cannot be done with
the current serial8250 driver, as it will fail in the
request_mem_region() call.

I really think it is a shame if we cannot use mfd-core for mfd drivers
that just happens to need serial8250 driver.
