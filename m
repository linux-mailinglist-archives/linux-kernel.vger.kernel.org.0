It doesn't matter how much randomness it's requesting.  With the new
cryptographic random number generator, the CRNG is either
initialized.... or it's not.

Unfortuantely, I very much doubt this is going to work.  That's
because the add_disk_randomness() path is only used for legacy
/dev/random (which actually only still exists because of some insane
PCI compliance issues which a number of end users really care about
--- or they care about because it makes the insane PCI complaince labs
go away).

Also, because by default, the vast majority of disks have
/sys/block/XXX/queue/add_random set to zero by default.

So the the way we get entropy these days for initializing the CRNG is
via the add_interrupt_randomness() path, where do something really
fast, and we assume that we get enough uncertainity from 8 interrupts
to give us one bit of entropy (64 interrupts to give us a byte of
entropy), and that we need 512 bits of entropy to consider the CRNG
fully initialized.  (Yeah, there's a lot of conservatism in those
estimates, and so what we could do is decide to say, cut down the
number of bits needed to initialize the CRNG to be 256 bits, since
that's the size of the CHACHA20 cipher.)

Ultimately, though, we need to find *some* way to fix userspace's
assumptions that they can always get high quality entropy in early
boot, or we need to get over people's distrust of Intel and RDRAND.
Otherwise, future performance improvements in any part of the system
which reduces the number of interrupts is always going to potentially
result in somebody's misconfigured system or badly written
applications to fail to boot.  :-(
