No, not really. With data being ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN and coming after
the devres private stuff, given that the another allocation will also be
aligned to ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN (because that's what k*alloc will give
us) we are guaranteed that DMA will not stomp onto any unrelated data.
With devres private coming after data and not having any alignment
constraints we may very well clobber it when doing DMA.

BTW, I am not sure where the page size restriction you mentioned earlier
is coming from. We have been using kmalloc()ed memory as buffers
suitable for DMA since forever, and we only need to make sure such data
is isolated from other data CPU might be accessing by ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN
which is usually L1 cache size.

From Documentation/DMA-API-HOWTO.txt:

2) ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN

   Architectures must ensure that kmalloc'ed buffer is
   DMA-safe. Drivers and subsystems depend on it. If an architecture
   isn't fully DMA-coherent (i.e. hardware doesn't ensure that data in
   the CPU cache is identical to data in main memory),
   ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN must be set so that the memory allocator
   makes sure that kmalloc'ed buffer doesn't share a cache line with
   the others. See arch/arm/include/asm/cache.h as an example.

   Note that ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN is about DMA memory alignment
   constraints. You don't need to worry about the architecture data
   alignment constraints (e.g. the alignment constraints about 64-bit
   objects).

Well, there is a metric ton of devm users that do not allocate memory
buffers, but other objects, and for which we do not need to worry about
alignment.

Thanks.
