Appreciate the feedback Frank!

I didn't mean for people to focus on the deferred probe optimization.
In reality that was just a added side benefit of this series. The main
problem to solve is that of suppliers having to know when all their
consumers are up and managing the resources actively, especially in a
system with loadable modules where we can't depend on the driver to
notify the supplier because the consumer driver module might not be
available or loaded until much later.

Having said that, I'm not saying we should go around and waste space
willy-nilly. But, isn't the memory usage going to increase based on
the number of DT nodes present in DT? I'd think as the number of DT
nodes increase it's more likely for those devices have more memory? So
at least in this specific case I think adding the field is justified.

Also, right now the look up is O(n) complexity and if we are trying to
add device links to most of the devices, that whole process becomes
O(n^2). Having this field makes the look up a O(1) and the entire
linking process a O(n) process. I think the memory usage increase is
worth the efficiency improvement.

And if people are still strongly against it, we could make this a config option.
