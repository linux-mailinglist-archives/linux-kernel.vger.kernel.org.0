Wouldn't different SoCs having same SMC SOC_ID and revision be a 
(fixable) mistake in the SMC FW?

And if it's not implemented, then no PMU events aliasing in perf tool 
for those uncore PMUs - nothing gets broken though and no regression. 
But I do understand your concern here.

Then doesn't that per-PMU ID qualify as brittle and non-standard also?

At least the SMC SoC ID is according to some standard.

And typically most PMU HW would have no ID reg, so where to even get 
this identification info? Joakim Zhang seems to have this problem for 
the imx8 DDRC PMU driver.

This case is complicated, like others I anticipate.

So the SMMU PMCG HW has no ID register itself, and this idea relies on 
using the associated SMMUv3 IIDR in lieu. For that, we need to involve 
the IORT, SMMUv3, and SMMU PMCG drivers to create this linkage, and even 
then I still have my doubts on whether this is even proper.

Please see 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/1569854031-237636-1-git-send-email-john.garry@huawei.com/ 
for reference.

Or are there

I will also note that perf tool PMU events framework relies today on 
generating a table of events aliases per CPU and matching based on that. 
If you want to totally disassociate a CPU or any SoC ID mapping, then 
this will require big perf tool rework.

Thanks,
John
