Is that a problem though? It's not safe in general to rewrite the 
default domain willy-nilly, so if it's a concern that drivers get stuck 
having to use a translation domain if they do something dumb like:

	if (!dma_set_mask(DMA_BIT_MASK(32))
		dma_set_mask(DMA_BIT_MASK(64));

then the simple solution is "don't do that" - note that this doesn't 
affect overriding of the default 32-bit mask, because we don't use the 
driver API to initialise those.

If the games you're worried about are stuff like:

	dma_set_mask(dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(64));
	high_buf = dma_alloc_coherent(dev, ...);
	dma_set_mask(dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(32));
	low_buf = dma_alloc_coherent(dev, ...);

then iommu_need_mapping() already ensures that will end spectacularly 
badly. Unless we can somehow log when a mask has been "committed" by a 
mapping operation, I don't think any kind of opportunistic bypass 
mechanism is ever not going to blow up that case.

Having thought a bit more, I guess my idea does end up with one slightly 
ugly corner wherein dma_direct_supported() has to learn to look for an 
IOMMU default domain and try iommu_dma_supported() before saying no, 
even if it's clean everywhere else. The bypass flag is more 'balanced' 
in terms of being equally invasive everywhere and preserving abstraction 
a bit better. Plus I think it might let us bring back the default 
assignment of dma_dummy_ops, which I do like the thought of :D

Either way, making sure that the fundamental bypass decision is correct 
and robust is still far more important than the implementation details.

Robin.
