I wouldn't say that most -- to my knowledge, it's only about 5-6 
components of the 50+. It's hard to tell how much that is by volume, 
though, because certainly not all components see much activity.

We *can* excise things on lore.kernel.org. It's a massive pain, since 
message archive is a git repository itself, so will need to be rebased, 
reindexed and remirrored -- but it *is* possible. On the other hand, 
once a commit makes it into the kernel's git tree, it becomes impossible 
to edit it without affecting the PGP integrity of all git tags following 
it. Since PGP signatures can be considered a core aspect of the git tree 
integrity, we can then argue that editing commit history of linux.git is 
unreasonable per GDPR's own guidelines. We can't make the same claim 
about lists on lore.kernel.org.

That's probably something we should do. I'll investigate it.
