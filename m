Totally agreed, we are working on this in the system level including SMMU.

Sure :), the good news is that ARM officially announced will be
working with Huawei again.

So if I understand your point correctly, we need steps to take:
 - ARM spec needs to make TIBi by range crystal clear and being
   written down in the spec;
 - Firmware description of supporting TLBi by range in system level
   for both FDT and ACPI;
 - Then upstream the code.

Thanks
