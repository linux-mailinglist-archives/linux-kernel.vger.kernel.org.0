Thanks Andy for reviewing and giving the inputs.
I will update them as per your comments, but for couple of cases of i 
have a different opinion. Please check and give your inputs.

Yes, OF is not required. I will remove it.

My bad. I will update it.

Sure i will remove them.

To be meaningful, i will remove the max entry for the enums representing 
the value of register bitfields.

Sure, it looks appropriate for intel_cbphy_iphy_dt_parse() -> 
intel_cbphy_iphy_fwnode_parse().
Whereas for intel_cbphy_dt_parse() i will keep it unchanged, because it 
is calling devm_*, devm_platform_*, fwnode_* APIs to traverse dt node.

I will add it. Thanks for pointing it.

In the v2 patch, for int i = 0 you mentioned to do initialization at the 
user, instead of doing at declaration.
So i followed the same for "pdev" and "fwnode" which are being used 
after few lines of the code . It looked good in the perspective of code 
readability.
