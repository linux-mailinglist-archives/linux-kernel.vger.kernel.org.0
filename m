I can't tell... Are you referring to the comment lines after
of_reserved_mem_device_init() in omap_rproc_probe()?

Given all the things happening in the platform drivers adding and
registering a single carveout doesn't seem that onerous to me.   I
also expect setting rproc->vdevbuf_mem_id would involve some form of
parsing.  Lastly if a couple of platforms end up doing the same thing
might as well bring the code in the core, hence choosing a generic
name such as rproc->name for the memory region.

At the very least I would use of_reserved_mem_device_init_by_idx(dev,
np, 0).  I agree it is not flexible but I'll take that over adding a
new field to structure rproc.
