KVMCLOCK has lots of legacy derived from times when TSC synchronization
was not a given (I heard that this is still sometimes problematic with
multi-socket systems but oh well). If I was to design a new clock I'd
probably mirror Hyper-V's TSC page clocksource invalidating the page
when host timekeeper values are updated (and making guest spin).

The tricky part with this approach is probably tsc scaling/tsc
offsetting which is still going to be controlled by kvmclock (so the
guest has no option to read 'pure TSC'). As an alternative, you can make
kvmclock un-pluggable so when it's not enabled TSC frequency/offset can
remain intact. You can, of course, try to update timekeeper values to
match the new frequency/offset every time they change but rounding
errors may bite.
