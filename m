You already construct the big model out of small generators, this is
just one more of those little generators.

Yeah, I know about that one; you've used it in your talks. Also, you've
modeled the schedule preempt disable as a special state. If you want we
can actually make it a special bit in the preempt_count word too, the
patch shouldn't be too hard, although it would make no practical
difference.

You can easily build a little shim betwen the model and the tracehooks
that fix this up if you don't want to stick it in the model proper.

All the information is there. Heck you can even do that 3/3 thing
internally I think.
