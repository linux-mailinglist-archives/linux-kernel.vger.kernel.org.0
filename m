Most of that stuff was introduced in

commit 31d3d3484f9bd263925ecaa341500ac2df3a5d9b
Author: Wu Fengguang <fengguang.wu@intel.com>
Date:   Wed Dec 16 12:19:59 2009 +0100

     HWPOISON: limit hwpoison injector to known page types

     __memory_failure()'s workflow is

             set PG_hwpoison
             //...
             unset PG_hwpoison if didn't pass hwpoison filter

     That could kill unrelated process if it happens to page fault on the
     page with the (temporary) PG_hwpoison. The race should be big enough to
     appear in stress tests.

     Fix it by grabbing the page and checking filter at inject time.  This
     also avoids the very noisy "Injecting memory failure..." messages.


Now, we still have the same "issue" in memory_failure() today:


	if (TestSetPageHWPoison(p)) {
		pr_err("Memory failure: %#lx: already hardware poisoned\n",
			pfn);
		return 0;
	}
[...]
	if (hwpoison_filter(p)) {
		if (TestClearPageHWPoison(p))
			num_poisoned_pages_dec();
		unlock_page(p);
		put_hwpoison_page(p);
		return 0;
	}

However, I don't understand why we need that special handling only for this
debug interface and not the other users.

I'd vote for ripping out that legacy crap (so the interface works correctly
with ZONE_DEVICE) and instead (if really required) rework memory_failure()
to not produce such side effects.
