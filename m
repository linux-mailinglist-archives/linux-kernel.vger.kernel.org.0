Yeah, I was aware of this but wasn't sure how likely this case was. I
didn't want to go down the rabbit hole of handling every corner case
perfectly before seeing how the general idea was received by the
maintainers. Also, was waiting to see if someone complained about it
before trying to fix it.

Yeah, those are all good example of when this could be an issue.

I'm not sure linking struct device_node would be useful here. There
are different and simpler ways of fixing it. Working on them right now
(v3 patch series). Thanks for bringing up the good examples.

Yes, I intentionally left out regulators here because it's a huge can
of worms. But keep in mind, that even without adding regulator DT
binding handling here, you could still switch to sync_state callback
and be no worse than you are today. Once regulator supplier-consumer
linking is added/improved, the QTI boards would start working with
modules.

As for how regulators supplier-consumer linking is handled, I think
that's the one we need to discuss and figure out. But I don't think
the regulator binding necessarily has to be handled in this patch
series. I'm sure in general the number of bindings we support could be
improved over time.

Yup. Maybe we can add a new regulator binding format with a more
consistent name (like clocks and interconnects) and deprecate the
older ones? Seems like a need binding clean up in general.

If I'm not mistaken, looks like this can be multiple sub-nodes deep
too. One option is to walk up the phandle till we find a compatible
string and then find the device for that node?

Sigh... as if it's not already complicated enough. Anyway,
device_link_add() already has a bunch of check to avoid creating
cyclic dependencies, etc. So, I'd expect this to be handled already.
At worst case, we might need to add a few more checks there. But that
hopefully shouldn't be an issue.

Yup and I hate this part. Not sure what to say.

Interconnects have a similar problem too because every interconnect
lists all the other interconnects it's connected to. Even if that's
magically addressed correctly, interconnect consumers still have a
problem because "interconnect" DT binding only lists phandles of the
source and destination interconnect and not all the interconnect along
the way. So they will be missing dependencies.

In general I agree with your points about clocks. I've brought this up
multiple times, but the maintainers insists I first implement parsing
existing DT bindings. So, I've done that. Lets see what they have to
say now.

But I have a few more ideas for handling circular dependencies without
adding new DT bindings that might work (will send out as part of v3
patch series) but interconnects are still an issue.

That's why I added the OF_DEVLINKS config. As of v2, you simply can't
use it for SoC/boards with cyclic clock dependencies. But again,
sync_state is no worse that what's there today. And it'll only improve
over time.
