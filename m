Great, thanks! I'll send a proper patch then.

AFAICS the default THP defrag mode is unaffected, as GFP_TRANSHUGE_LIGHT doesn't
include __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM, so it never reaches this code. Madvised THP
allocations will be affected, which should best be tested the same way as Andrea
and Mel did in the __GFP_THISNODE debate.
