Sorry for creating this mess, I guess I need to take another spin at 
this, but first I'd like to straighten out a few details:

- I've never had any kernel code more reviewed than this. It's been out 
on LKML and mm-list and maintainers I think 8 times including the RFC. 
The last time I was explicitly asking if anybody had any objections 
because I wanted to get it merged. It's not an internally-reviewed-only 
thing. There have been a number of people looking at the code and 
leaving comments and requesting fixes including Ralph Campbell, Jerome 
Glisse, Souptick Joarder, Nadav Amit and Christoph Hellwig. Perhaps I 
should have been more explicit in requesting R-Bs after fixing up all 
review comments, but I didn't. None of them had any issues similar to 
the ones you describe above.

- The combined callback / argument struct: It was strongly inspired by 
the struct mm_walk (mm.h), the page walk code being quite similar in 
functionality. "Closure" is perhaps a bad name. Originates in X server code.

Thanks,
Thomas
