I am not sure how the hypercall page makes things different. You still 
have to store the arguments in the correct register so...

... I don't think they will be easier to implement with a few static 
inlines. The implementation will likely end up to be similar to 
arch/x86/asm/xen/hypercall.h.

Furthermore, one of the downside of per-arch static inline is it is more 
difficult to ensure the prototype match for all the architectures. 
Although, it might be possible to make them common by only requesting 
per-arch to implement HYPERCALL_N(...).

So I think the code is better as it is.

While looking at the code, I also realized that the implementation of 
HYPERCALL_dm_op might be incorrect for Arm32. Similarly do privcmd call, 
I think dm_op call should enable user access as they will be used by 
userspace.

We don't use dm_op on Arm so far, hence why I think this was unnoticed. 
I will see if I can reproduce it and send a patch.

Cheers,
