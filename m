First of all, the limits in clm_blob were tuned for each product (not 
really for each board, my bad) based on the real test data in the lab, 
so it's not just about the limits set by countries. Different product 
needs different configs even when being used in the same country and on 
the same channel.

The clm_blob came with previous firmware isn't really "generic". It's 
actually a collection of configs for many products. That collection is 
not comprehensive, so there will be products that it doesn't cover. If 
such product uses the firmware/clm_blob, it could violate regulatory. 
Cypress clm_blob may or may not cover Broadcom products.

To make it truly safe on linux-firmware.git, a real "geneirc" clm_blob 
would be needed. I'll leave that discussion to Chris.
