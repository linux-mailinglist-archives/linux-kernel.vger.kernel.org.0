I think so.  I actually did

	bad	a2d635decbfa9c1e4ae15cb05b68b2559f7f827c
	good	89c3b37af87ec183b666d83428cb28cc421671a6

But I think ^ steps down in the main branch.  Note, I've only done a
couple of hours run on what I think is the good commit ... and actually
I'd already marked a2d635decbfa9c1e4ae15cb05b68b2559f7f827c as good
until the screen froze just after I'd built the new bisect kernel, so
there's still some chance 89c3b37af87ec183b666d83428cb28cc421671a6 is
bad.

I can get back to it this afternoon, when I'm done with the meeting
requirements and doing other dev stuff.
