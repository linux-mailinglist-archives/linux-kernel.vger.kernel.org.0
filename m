Hi Thomas,

Where you successful in your testing? My type-c exposure is somewhat
limited so it would be nice to get another opinion ;-)

The whole type-c topic is a somewhat undiscovered country on rk3399, due to
the cross-ec hooking rk3399's type-c components. (see the cros-ec-pd extcon
going to the rockchip type-c phy etc).

This is presently worked on so that also everything can at some point use the
kernel-internal type-c framework.

But of course this doesn't hinder configuring the power-develivery in the
fusb302 ICs already :-D .
