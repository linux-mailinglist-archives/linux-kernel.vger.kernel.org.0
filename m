The rationale is to encourage others to start laying the groundwork for 
future Sv48 support.  The immediate trigger for it was Alex's mmap 
randomization support patch series, which needs to set some Kconfig 
options differently depending on the selection of Sv32/39/48.

Reflecting on this assertion, the only case that I could come up with is 
that randconfig or allyesconfig build testing could fail.  Is this the 
case that you're thinking of, or is there a different one?  If that's the 
one, I do agree that it would be best to avoid this case, and it looks 
like there's no obvious way to work around that issue.

The expectation is that kernels that support multiple virtual memory 
system modes at runtime will probably incur either a performance or a 
memory layout penalty for doing so.  So performance-sensitive embedded 
applications will select only the model that they use, while distribution 
kernels will likely take the performance hit for broader single-kernel 
support.
