Well, the only function in systohc.c is rtc_set_ntp_time and its only
user is kernel/time/ntp.c. That why I suggested on IRC to move it to the
kernel timekeeping instead of having it in the rtc subsystem. Also, this
function only works properly on systems with an MC146818 compatible RTC.

The main issue I have with that is that while the offset is possibly
specific to an RTC, it is something that is not used by the rtc
subsystem as this offset handling is done by the caller. i.e. hwclock
handles local time vs UTC time. That is why sync_rtc_clock also had to
do it. It would be awkward to have different paths in the rtc core
depending on whether the set_time call is coming from userspace or the
kernel.

My point is that userspace has all the necessary info to do a correct
job. It is even more flexible because currently the kernel is limited
to the rtc selected at compile time (this often ends up being rtc0 which
may or may not be functional or battery backed) and the 11 minute
interval is fixed.
