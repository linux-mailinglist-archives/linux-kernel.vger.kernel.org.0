thanks for clarifying, Roger.

Pawel, Roger is correct here. But in any case, if *real* bugs are found
on the legacy gadget drivers, let's see if they happen with
configfs-based interface as well. They should behave exactly the same
nowadays since legacy driver were converted to simply programmatically
spawn the configfs interface.

If there are bugs in legacy gadget drivers, we *WANT* to fix those.
