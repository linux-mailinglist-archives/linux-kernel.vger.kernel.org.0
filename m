I don't understand the relationship you're trying to draw between mem-stores
and SPE. How does perf-mem work and what does it actually require from the
CPU?

One thing that may be worth noting is that SPE isn't generally able to
capture information about all instructions being executed by the CPU:
instead, it instructions (most likely micro-ops) are sampled based on
some user-specified period. The CPU advertises a minimum recommended
period which we expose under /sys and enforce when programming events.

I don't see how you could reconcile the sampling nature of SPE with a
CPU PMU counter, particularly as filtering in SPE happens /after/ sampling.

I don't think there's enough information here to comment meaningfully more
than SPE != PEBS.
