I don't know when "Description" and "RST-Description" would be used.
Why not just parse "Description" like rst text and if things are "messy"
we fix them up as found, like you did with the ":" here?  It doesn't
have to be complex, we can always fix them up after-the-fact if new
stuff gets added that doesn't quite parse properly.

Just like we do for most kernel-doc formatting :)
