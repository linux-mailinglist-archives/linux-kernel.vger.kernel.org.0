Phew, this patchset is a lot. It's good of course but can we please cut
some of the more advanced features such as querying by mount id,
submounts etc. pp. for now?
I feel this would help with review and since your interface is
extensible it's really not a big deal if we defer fancy features to
later cycles after people had more time to review and the interface has
seen some exposure.

The mount api changes over the last months have honestly been so huge
that any chance to make the changes smaller and easier to digest we
should take. (I'm really not complaining. Good that the work is done and
it's entirely ok that it's a lot of code.)

It would also be great if after you have dropped some stuff from this
patchset and gotten an Ack we could stuff it into linux-next for some
time because it hasn't been so far...
