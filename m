This would work for mmc sub-system, but my idea was that later when
more cells are added to this mfd - it might turn out that we would
require an early initialization anyway. So I decided to take an
opportunity to adjust it with this patch as well, and this is what I
roughly explained in the commit message. When I'm reading it now,
exactly this point was not mentioned in commit message at all, and I
rather coupled the early init with mmc sub-system, which creates a
source of confusion here. I guess if there would be no other
objections about early init - I'd go with v2 of this patch, where I
would clean-up the point below and adjust the commit description.

Thanks a lot for pointing this out!

Agreed, this was forgotten. Sorry for that.

True, this point I forgot to mention. Actually, this is tightly
coupled with the fact that mfd driver has been moved to an earlier
init stage and since it does belong to I2C sub-system (and represented
by i2c_device structure) - I decided to make a name sound more
logical.
