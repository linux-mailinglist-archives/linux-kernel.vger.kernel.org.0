First, I am sorry that I replay so late. I was traveling the previous
two weeks and was not able to follow the discussion about this patch.

I am fine with adding this feature. But I would like to do it
a cleaner way, see below.

Please, remove the above two paragraphs in the final patch. They make
sense for review but not for git history.

This change would deserve to spend some time in linux-next. Anyway,
it is already too late for 5.4.

The word "code" is quite ambiguous. I am not sure if it is the name or
the number. I think that it is actually both (the relation between
the two.

Both "man 3 errno" and
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Checking-for-Errors.html#Checking-for-Errors
talks about numbers and symbolic names.

Please use errname or so instead of errcode everywhere.

What is the exact reason to make this configurable, please?

Nobody was really against this feature. The only question
was if it was worth the code complexity and maintenance.
If we are going to have the code then we should use it.

Then there was a concerns that it might be too big for embedded
people. But did it come from people working on embedded kernel
or was it just theoretical?

I would personally enable it when CONFIG_PRINTK is enabled.
We could always introduce a new config option later when
anyone really wants to disable it.

I really like the way how the array is initialized.

I like that you check more values. But please split it to check
only one value per line to make it better readable.

We had similar code before the commit 3e5903eb9cff70730171 ("vsprintf:
Prevent crash when dereferencing invalid pointers"). Note that the
original code kept the original value also for *fmt == 'K'.

Anyway, the above commit tried to unify the handling of special
values:

   + use the same strings for special values
   + check for special values only when pointer is dereferenced

This patch makes it inconsistent again. I mean that the code will:

   + check for (null) and (efault) only when the pointer is
     dereferenced

   + check for err codes in more situations but not in all
     and not in %s

   + use another style to print the error (uppercase without
      brackets)


I would like to keep it consistent. My proposal is:

1. Print the plain error code name only when
   a new %pe modifier is used. This will be useful
   in the error messages, e.g.

	void *p = ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
	if (IS_ERR(foo)) {
		pr_err("Sorry, can't do that: %pe\n", foo);
	return PTR_ERR(foo);

   would produce

	Sorry, can't do that: -ENOMEM


2. Use error code names also in check_pointer_msg() instead
   of (efault). But put it into brackets to distinguish it
   from the expected value, for example:

      /* valid pointer */
      phys_addr_t addr = 0xab;
      printk("value: %pa\n", &addr);
      /* known error code */
      printk("value: %pa\n", ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM));
      /* unknown error code */
      printk("value: %pa\n", ERR_PTR(-1234));

   would produce:

     value: 0xab
     value: (-ENOMEM)
     value: (-1234)


3. Unify the style for the null pointer:

    + use (NULL) instead of (null)

4. Do not use error code names for internal vsprintf error
   to avoid confusion. For example:

    + replace the one (einval) with (%piS-err) or so

How does that sound, please?

Best Regards,
Petr
