IMO the ioctls defines the contract with userspace and the contract
establishes that userspace must call deallocate. the kernel wrongly
implemented to that contract since it doesn't handle the cases where
userspace can't send the release calls which leads to memory leaks. this
is what I meant by and implementation issue.

if we had many fastrpc users, rolling out the design change that you
propose - removing an ioctl- would definitively have an impact. But
since that is not yet the case, there is not doubt that your patch makes
more sense.

but my point was that there is not a huge gap in efforts between doing
one or the other.

yes it is redundant but is not the root cause for this leak. the root
cause is that the driver doesnt handle the case where userspace didnt or
was not able to call release (and that is no more than adding allocated
buffers to a list and clean on exit)
