Thanks, Mark. Yeah, it should be fine as you said. There are something else,
which might be not relevant. @secondary_data could be accessed by multiple CPUs
in parallel. For example, the master CPU boots CPU#1 and timeouts to wait it
to be online in 5 seconds. CPU#1 isn't necessarily stuck in somewhere. After
that, CPU#2 is brought up and might be accessing @secondary_data. At this point,
CPU#1 can come back to access it either. However, @secondary_data isn't valid
for CPU#1 anymore.

I was thinking of something to improve the situation, but not sure if it makes
any sense to do so. There are several options: (1) Make @secondary_data per-cpu
variable, which looks a nature way to go. (2) To shutdown the CPU on timeout.
The shutdown request can be failed to be served in theory, but it seems still
an improvement.

Thanks,
Gavin
