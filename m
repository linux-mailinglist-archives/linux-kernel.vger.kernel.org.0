Good day,

I write you today with optimism regarding a discussion that will  
benefit us both immensely

I am Reese Bechnam. LLB (Hons). Head Attorney with Clifford Bryant  
Solicitors,  Miami, FL and I got your information from the  
International directory here in Miami and after extensive research,  
you have a good record. So I decided to contact you

I have already drafted a detailed letter but due to the  
confidentiality and sensitive nature of the situation, I deem it  
necessary to confirm that this is your private email before I can  
proceed with sending you the detailed letter.

Kindly reply me on any of my emails. I await your prompt response.

Kind Regards,

Reese Bechnam
