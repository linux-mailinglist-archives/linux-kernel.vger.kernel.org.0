Arnld, would love your inputs before publishing v3 to avoid ping-pong.

Not sure what do you mean by debug tool. this is used to capture iliigle 
access and allow panic() based on them or simple logging.

Not the meaning of corrected from my point of view - the system as a 
whole (sw&hw) are not working state. a driver thinks it configured the 
system to do A while the system doesn't really do that. and the critical 
part is that the driver that did operation A doesn't even have a way to 
know it.

So I would not call this corrected.

I see what you say. However, I don't see too much added value in 
plugging this to EDAC and feel like it would abuse EDAC framework.

James, will love your input from EDAC point of view, does it make sense 
to plug un-correctable only event to EDAC?
