Hi Vincent,

I took the liberty of adding some commenting nits in my review. I
know this is already in tip, but as Mel pointed out this should be merged
with the rework when sent out to mainline (similar to the removal of
fix_small_imbalance() & the LB rework).

For both @cpu and @p, s/which/whose/ (also applies to cpu_util_without()
which inspired this).

          ^^^^^^^^^^^^
That could very well be bool, right?
