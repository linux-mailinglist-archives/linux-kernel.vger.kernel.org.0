What about the dma masks? I think there's a default setup, but it is
considered a driver bug to not set its mask. xen_drm_front sets the
coherent_dma_mask (why only 32-bits though?), but not the dma_mask.
gntdev is doing neither. I could copy out what of_dma_configure does
but better for the Xen folks to decide what is needed or not and test
the change. I'm not setup to test any of this.
