It has been designated consumed by the bootloader on x86 since at least 19=
95=2E So ARM broke it=2E

How is this information passed to any version of Linux in the first place,=
 and how do you then start up Linux? I suspect this is probably rather simp=
le in the end=2E=2E=2E

Note that when Linux is run as an UEFI binary the kernel UEFI stub can loa=
d an initrd file via the UEFI file I/O interface=2E

In some ways, arguably the Right Thing for the firmware to expose this wou=
ld be to have a resource exposed via ACPI =2E
