Yes, maybe open a new thread and be sure to copy PeterZ.  He loves those
warnings ;-)  Object files are definitely needed.

Just to clarify, there are two clang issues.  Both of them were reported
originally by Arnd, IIRC.

1) The one described above and in patch 20, where the switch table is
   mostly unused entries.  Not a real bug, but it's a bit sloppy and
   wasteful, and objtool doesn't know how to interpret it.

2) The bug with the noreturn call site having a different stack size
   depending on which code path was taken.

Oops, those extra 3 commits weren't supposed to be there.  That's future
work.  I dropped them from the branch.
