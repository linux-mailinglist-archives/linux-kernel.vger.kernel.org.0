Because the USB Connector is introduced and the requirement of
usb-connector.txt binding, the old way using extcon to support
USB Dual-Role switch is now deprecated, meanwhile there is no
available common driver when use Type-B connector, typically
using an input GPIO to detect USB ID pin.
This patch series introduce a USB GPIO based connection detection
driver and try to replace the function provided by extcon-usb-gpio
driver.

v11 changes:
  1. add Reviewed-by Linus for [02/11] ad [03/11]
  2. change compatible as "gpio-usb-b-connector", and remove label
    in example suggested by Rob

NOTE: based on the following series
 https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1103630/
 [v3,1/7] drivers: Introduce device lookup variants by name

 they are already in:
 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-core.git/log/drivers/base/core.c?h=driver-core-next

v10 changes:
  1. revert commit log changes of [06/11] and [07/11]

v9 changes:
  1. replace signed-off-by by suggested-by Heikki
  2. add reviewed-by Linus
  3. use class_find_device_by_fwnode() introduced by series [1]

 [v3,1/7] drivers: Introduce device lookup variants by name

 they are already in:
 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-core.git/log/drivers/base/core.c?h=driver-core-next

v8 changes:
  1. rename the driver's name suggested by Heikki
  2. move the driver from usb/roles/ into usb/common/ suggested by Heikki
  3. introduce Kconfig for usb common core to add the new driver
  4. modify binding of the driver 
  5. rename the subject title

v7 changes:
  1. [5/10]: add signed-off-by Chunfeng
  2. [6/10]: add signed-off-by Chunfeng
  3. [6/10]: depends on linux-next of Rafael's tree [1]
  4. [7/10]: add signed-off-by Chunfeng and tested-by Biju
  5. [9/10]: add tested-by Nagarjuna, and remove DEV_PMS_OPS suggested by Andy

[1] https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git/log/?h=linux-next

v6 changes:
  1. merge [1] and [2] into this series
  2. don't use graph anymore to find usb-role-switch
  3. abandon [3] and introduce three patches (6, 7, 8 in this series)
     to rebuild APIs getting usb-role-switch

  [1]: [v3] dt-binding: usb: add usb-role-switch property
       https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10934835/
  [2]: [v6,08/13] usb: roles: Introduce stubs for the exiting functions in role.h
       https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10909971/

  [3]: [PATCH v5 4/6] usb: roles: add API to get usb_role_switch by node

v5 changes:
  1. remove linux/of.h and put usb_role_switch when error happens,
     suggested by Biju
  2. treat Type-B connector as USB controller's child, but not as
     a virtual device, suggested by Rob
  3. provide and use generic property "usb-role-switch", see [1],
     suggested by Rob

  Note: this series still depends on [2]

  [1]: [v3] dt-binding: usb: add usb-role-switch property
       https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10934835/
  [2]: [v6,08/13] usb: roles: Introduce stubs for the exiting functions in role.h
       https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10909971/

v4 changes:
  1. use switch_fwnode_match() to find fwnode suggested by Heikki
  2. assign fwnode member of usb_role_switch struct suggested by Heikki
  3. make [4/6] depend on [2]
  3. remove linux/gpio.h suggested by Linus
  4. put node when error happens

  [4/6] usb: roles: add API to get usb_role_switch by node
  [2] [v6,08/13] usb: roles: Introduce stubs for the exiting functions in role.h
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10909971/

v3 changes:
  1. add GPIO direction, and use fixed-regulator for GPIO controlled
    VBUS regulator suggested by Rob;
  2. rebuild fwnode_usb_role_switch_get() suggested by Andy and Heikki
  3. treat the type-B connector as a virtual device;
  4. change file name of driver again
  5. select USB_ROLE_SWITCH in mtu3/Kconfig suggested by Heikki
  6. rename ssusb_mode_manual_switch() to ssusb_mode_switch()

v2 changes:
 1. make binding clear, and add a extra compatible suggested by Hans

Chunfeng Yun (8):
  dt-binding: usb: add usb-role-switch property
  dt-bindings: connector: add optional properties for Type-B
  dt-bindings: usb: add binding for USB GPIO based connection detection
    driver
  dt-bindings: usb: mtu3: add properties about USB Role Switch
  usb: roles: get usb-role-switch from parent
  usb: common: create Kconfig file
  usb: common: add USB GPIO based connection detection driver
  usb: mtu3: register a USB Role Switch for dual role mode

Heikki Krogerus (2):
  device connection: Add fwnode_connection_find_match()
  usb: roles: Add fwnode_usb_role_switch_get() function

Yu Chen (1):
  usb: roles: Introduce stubs for the exiting functions in role.h
