Ok. I haven't looked at that series yet. We can move this discussion
there if you like.

Why is it dangerous? If the clk state is lost across suspend/resume we
need to restore the state of the clk somehow. One way would be to have
the clk driver tell the framework that this clk is now off and to drop
the enable counts for any consumers. Then consumers will need to call
clk_enable() again to turn the clk back on in the consumer resume
callback. Or we can try to be smarter/nicer and restore the clk state to
what the consumer is expecting across suspend/resume. I haven't thought
about what is better or worse.

On the one hand, device drivers already handle some things not being
saved/restored during system low power modes. But on the other hand I
don't know what the policy is for external resources that a device uses,
such as clks or regulators or pinctrl muxing, etc.
