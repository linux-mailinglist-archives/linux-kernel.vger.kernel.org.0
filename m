Hi Ming,

The patch I shared was my original solution, based on the driver setting 
flag IRQF_IRQ_AFFINITY to request the threaded handler uses the irq 
affinity mask for the handler cpu allowed mask.

If we want to make this decision based only on whether the irq is 
managed or not, then we can drop the flag and just make the change as 
you suggest, below.

Thanks,
John
