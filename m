What exactly do you expect distributions to do with this?  I can tell
you that most of them will take the default option, so this gets set to
N and you may as well not have got the patches upstream because you
won't be able to use them in any distro with this setting.

Well, no they can't ... it's rather rare nowadays for people to build
their own kernels.  The vast majority of Linux consumers take what the
distros give them.  Think carefully before you decide a config option
is the solution to this problem.
