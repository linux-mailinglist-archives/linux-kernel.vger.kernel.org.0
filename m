+arising in any way out of the use of this driver software, even if advised
+of the possibility of such damage.
+
+This driver supports the Adaptec I2O RAID and DPT SmartRAID V I2O boards.
+
+Credits
+=======
+
+The original linux driver was ported to Linux by Karen White while at
+Dell Computer.  It was ported from Bob Pasteur's (of DPT) original
+non-Linux driver.  Mark Salyzyn and Bob Pasteur consulted on the original
+driver.
+
+2.0 version of the driver by Deanna Bonds and Mark Salyzyn.
+
+History
+=======
+
+The driver was originally ported to linux version 2.0.34
+
+==== ==========================================================================
+V2.0 Rewrite of driver.  Re-architectured based on i2o subsystem.
+     This was the first full GPL version since the last version used
+     i2osig headers which were not GPL.  Developer Testing version.
+V2.1 Internal testing
+V2.2 First released version
+
+V2.3 Changes:
+
+     - Added Raptor Support
+     - Fixed bug causing system to hang under extreme load with
+     - management utilities running (removed GFP_DMA from kmalloc flags)
+
+V2.4 First version ready to be submitted to be embedded in the kernel
+
+     Changes:
+
+     - Implemented suggestions from Alan Cox
+     - Added calculation of resid for sg layer
+     - Better error handling
+     - Added checking underflow conditions
+     - Added DATAPROTECT checking
+     - Changed error return codes
+     - Fixed pointer bug in bus reset routine
+     - Enabled hba reset from ioctls (allows a FW flash to reboot and use
+       the new FW without having to reboot)
+     - Changed proc output
+==== ==========================================================================
+
+TODO
+====
+- Add 64 bit Scatter Gather when compiled on 64 bit architectures
+- Add sparse lun scanning
+- Add code that checks if a device that had been taken offline is
+  now online (at the FW level) when test unit ready or inquiry
+  command from scsi-core
+- Add proc read interface
+- busrescan command
+- rescan command
+- Add code to rescan routine that notifies scsi-core about new devices
+- Add support for C-PCI (hotplug stuff)
+- Add ioctl passthru error recovery
+
+Notes
+=====
+The DPT card optimizes the order of processing commands.  Consequently,
+a command may take up to 6 minutes to complete after it has been sent
+to the board.
+
+The files dpti_ioctl.h dptsig.h osd_defs.h osd_util.h sys_info.h are part of the
+interface files for Adaptec's management routines.  These define the structures used
+in the ioctls.  They are written to be portable.  They are hard to read, but I need
+to use them 'as is' or I can miss changes in the interface.
