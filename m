In your situation this race shouldn't happen, because before
udc->driver->unbind() is invoked we call usb_gadget_disconnect().  If
that routine succeeds -- which it always does under dummy-hcd -- then
there can't be any more setup callbacks, because find_endpoint() will
always return NULL (the is_active() test fails; see the various
set_link_state* routines).  So I don't see how you could have ended up
with the race you describe.

However, a real UDC might not be able to perform a disconnect under
software control.  In that case usb_gadget_disconnect() would not
change the pullup state, and there would be a real possibility of a
setup callback racing with an unbind callback.  This seems like a 
genuine problem and I can't think of a solution offhand.

What we would need is a way to tell the UDC driver to stop invoking
gadget callbacks, _before_ the UDC driver's stop callback gets called.
Maybe this should be merged into the pullup callback somehow.
