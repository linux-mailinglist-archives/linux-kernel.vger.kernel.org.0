Ah you're right. In practice I doubt it makes much of a difference,
though, because...

80-200 kb/s. In general we try to keep this low to non-existent on our
hosts due to the latency implications. So it's fair to say that kswapd
does page reclaim, and direct reclaim is a sign of overload.

Thanks! I'll send an updated changelog.

Haha, agreed.
