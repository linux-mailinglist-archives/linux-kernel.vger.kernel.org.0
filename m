Thanks for the trace. Now things are clear to me. Two RT tasks woke up
simultaneously and the first task got its previous CPU i.e CPU#1. The next task
goes through find_lowest_rq() and got the same CPU#1. Since this task priority
is not more than the just queued task (already queued on CPU#1), it is sent
to its previous CPU i.e CPU#4 in your case.

From task_woken_rt() path, CPU#4 attempts push_rt_tasks(). CPU#4 is
not overloaded,
but we have rt_task_fits_capacity() check which forces the push. Since the CPU
is not overloaded, your has_unfit_tasks() comes to rescue and push the
task. Since
the task has not scheduled in yet, it is eligible for push. You added checks
to skip resched_curr() in push_rt_tasks() otherwise the push won't happen.

Finally, I understood your patch. Obviously this is not clear to me
before. I am not
sure if this patch is the right approach to solve this race. I will
think a bit more.

Thanks,
Pavan
