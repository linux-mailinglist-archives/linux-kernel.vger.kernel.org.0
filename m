OK, thanks for the notice :)

Thank you for covering these items :) Yes, these are what I'm thinking.

Yes, I see. But I think there is a room to contain a small communication
channel under /chosen, from bootloader.

I actually don't want it :( but if the ascii commands can be compressed
(maybe not so efficient), it is a possible way.

Initrd is not passed via kernel cmdline, it is loaded and passed via architecture
dependent way. As far as I know, x86 and arm (without DT) uses own data structure,
arm64 (and arm with DT) uses devicetree /chosen node.

Yes, it is optional.

Yes, any data which doesn't need complex parser is OK.

But that means we need to fill the data structure when we build the kernel,
isn't it?

We can, but we also has to change bootloaders.

Indeed, if we extend kernel cmdline to support it, such tool we have to
introduce (like dtc)

Yeah, but does that mean we have to rebuild kernel image?
In some cases, (e.g. debugging distro kernel) we can not modify kernel image
also, I don't like to replace entire image. I would like to choose a tracing
command file from boot loader.

Oh, I thought you meant that the new data was added boot time by
boot loader.

I think if the boot loader supports overlay file, we can choose
the overlay file when booting for /chosen node. That can be a
part of boot loader choice, isn't it? :)
