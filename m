Should be "discarded".

Message authentication code. I open

I rewrote the whole local attestation section:

"In local attestation an enclave creates a **REPORT** data structure
with **ENCLS[EREPORT]**, which describes the origin of an enclave. In
particular, it contains a AES-CMAC of the enclave contents signed with a
report key unique to each processor. All enclaves have access to this
key.

This mechanism can also be used in addition as a communication channel
as the **REPORT** data structure includes a 64-byte field for variable
information."

It should be "allows a 3rd party".

I rewrote it as:

"Intel provides a proprietary binary version of the PCE. This is a
necessity when the software needs to prove to be running inside a legit
enclave on real hardware."

Thank you for the comments.
