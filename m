Hi Greg,

Apologies for the delay. I de-duplicated selection code in speakup to
use code that's already in kernel (commit ids 496124e5e16e and
41f13084506a). Following items are what remain now:

1. moving kobjects location
2. fixing garbled text

I couldn't replicate garbled text but Simon (also in CC list) is
looking into it.

Can you please advise on the way forward?

Thanks,
Okash
