I don't really think it would need to be a sphinx extension. If I were
to do this from scratch, I'd just leave it be any convention that's
compatible with rst. Perhaps field lists [1], for both parameters and
return values. With that you could do things like:

 * :Returns: 0 on success.
 * :Returns: -ENOCOFFEE when out of coffee.
 * :Returns: Other negative error codes for other errors.

or:

 * :Returns: 0 on success, -ENOCOFFEE when out of coffee, and other negative
 *           error codes for other errors.

according to your tastes, and both render nicely. You could actually
start using those *now* without changes to kernel-doc or anything. Try
it!

(Side note, I think it would be nice to preprocess the current @param:
stuff into field lists instead of the definition lists that we use now.)

IMO, if you want to make a list, you use rst lists. If you want to add a
preformatted text block, you use rst preformatted text block. I don't
see any reason why those should be tied to certain headings such as
"return" or "example". Return does not have to be a list, and example
does not have to be a preformatted block.

I am also not a fan of *overusing* rst in kernel-doc. But we have it
there so that you can use it when you need it, and not have to hack at
the godawful kernel-doc the perl script every time. So that you can just
point at the widely available documentation on rst for doing everything,
instead of telling people to go figure it out from the perl source.

BR,
Jani.
