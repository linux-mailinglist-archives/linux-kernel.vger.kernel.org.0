I think you mean faster decay, if you refer to my comment above.

To be blunt, I'm not sure there is a strong case for either kind of
dacay, if we look at the test results only. There is a theoretical case
for both, in my opinion and given that the purpose of this patch is to
give options to platform with different thermal characteristics, I do
believe it's worth providing a good range of options for the decay
period.

Thanks,
Ionela.
