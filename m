 The spec is quite clear about the use of discrete APICs actually:

"5.1 Discrete APIC Configurations

"   Figure 5-1 shows the default configuration for systems that use the 
    discrete 82489 APIC.  The Intel486 processor is shown as an example; 
    however, this configuration can also employ Pentium processors.  In 
    Pentium processor systems, PRST is connected to INIT instead of to 
    RESET."

:)  And if in the way the internal local APIC in P54C processors can be
permanently disabled (causing it not to be reported in CPUID flags) via a 
reset strap, e.g. to support an unusual configuration.

 As I recall the integrated APIC would in principle support SMP configs 
beyond dual (the inter-APIC bus was serial at the time and supported 15 
APIC IDs with the P54C), but at the time the P54C processor was released 
the only compatible I/O APICs were available as a part of Intel PCI south 
bridges (the 82375EB/SB ESC and the 82379AB SIO.A).  Those chips were not 
necessarily compatible with whatever custom chipset was developed to 
support e.g. a quad-SMP P54C system.  Or there were political reasons 
preventing them from being used.

 Then the 82489DX used an incompatible protocol (supporting 254 APIC IDs 
among others, and as I recall the serial bus had a different number of 
wires even), so it couldn't be mixed with integrated local APICs.  That's 
why discrete APICs were sometimes used even with P54C processors.

 And the 82093AA standalone I/O APIC was only introduced a few years 
later, along with the Intel HX (Triton II) SMP chipset.  I still have a 
nice working machine equipped with this chipset and dual P55C processors 
@233MHz.  Even the original CPU fans are going strong. :)  Its MP table is 
however buggy and difficult to work with if the I/O APIC is to be used, 
especially if PCI-PCI bridges are involved (there's none onboard, but you 
can have these easily in multiple quantities on option cards nowadays).
