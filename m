There are two DMA APIs - the coherent (or "consistent") API for 
allocating buffers which are guaranteed safe for random access at any 
time *is* page-based, and on non-coherent architectures typically 
involves a non-cacheable remap. There is also the streaming API for 
one-off transfers of data already existing at a given kernel address 
(think network packets, USB URBs, etc), which on non-coherent 
architectures is achieved with explicit cache maintenance plus an API 
contract that buffers must not be explicitly accessed by CPUs for the 
duration of the mapping. Addresses from kmalloc() are explicitly valid 
for dma_map_single() (and indeed are about the only thing you'd ever 
reasonably feed it), which is the primary reason why 
ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN gets so big on architectures which can be 
non-coherent and also suffer from creative cache designs.

See DMA-API.txt and DMA-API-HOWTO.txt in Documentation/ for more details 
if you like.
