The commit message is missing description of what the commit does.
Please explain "what" before "why". Now "what" is completely lacking.
This paragraph starts as if there was an invisible paragraph before it.

You should start by explaining briefly about this:

1. A brief description of what vdso2c is.
2. A brief description of what changes you do to vdso2.
3. A brief description of what kernel change you do.
4. A brief description of the flow how the expection gets delivered
   to the user space.

All of this is completely missing.

No description of what is stored in DI, SI and DX. Also there is two
space bars after *every* sentence. Your text editor is totally broken
somehow. Also DB/BP exception is not described.

Rest of the story is a mess with bits of pieces of "what" and "why"
and mixed together. You could probably make the whole like 50% smaller
with a better organization.

I never understood anything of this commit message. Only by looking
at the code change and completely ignoring the commit message I could
understand what the heck is going on. The commit message in the current
for makes me understand *less* the code change.

It would be even better to delete it completely than have it in the
current form. I would suggest that you do that and concentrate writing
steps 1-4 that I described above.
