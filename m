Let me add another vote from a native English speaker that "unencrypted" 
is the appropriate term to imply the *absence* of encryption, whereas 
"decrypted" implies the *reversal* of applied encryption.

Naming things is famously hard, for good reason - names are *important* 
for understanding. Just because a decision was already made one way 
doesn't mean that that decision was necessarily right. Churning one area 
to be consistently inaccurate just because it's less work than churning 
another area to be consistently accurate isn't really the best excuse.

Robin.
