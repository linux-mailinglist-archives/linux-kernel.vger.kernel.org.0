Although I don't have schematic, I'm pretty sure. Without this patch or one at 
[1], RTC gives a lot of errors in dmesg. I think that unpopulated XC2 pads 
near SoC (see [2]) are probably reserved for crystal.

With patch in [1], which enables automatic switching in case of error, I saw 
that on this box RTC always switched to internal RC.

Can you be more specific where it is stated that crystal is mandatory? 

Note that schematic of some boards, like OrangePi PC2 (H5) or OrangePi Zero 
(H3) don't even have 32K crystal in them.

Yes, that would be nice solution. I can work something out if you agree that 
this is the way.

Sure, it is something to start discussion, I don't like tackling clocks in DT 
either.
