Hmm, for all cases to track number of running tasks, I think that would
end up being too costly because of the shared cache line.

I have to admit that is a possibility. The really interesting case for
other people is the transition from almost-fully-busy -> fully-busy ->
overloaded because the optimal amount to search changes at those points.
It's a minefield of hitting a regression somewhere whether you search
too much or too little.

It also can be somewhat problematic when there are multiple small llc
caches per numa node. In that case a "full" search is still a small number
of CPUs and premature cutoff can be hurtful. It eventually showed up when
enough tests ran for long enough.

I avoided that by only doing the write when there is a state transition.
set_sd_overloaded() does not write if it's already marked overloaded.

That is possible.

True, but I did not feel the race was extremely damaging because it
happens once per transition for up to sd_weight-1 unlucky tasks. The same
is true for the test for idle cores where multiple tasks can search for
an idle core unnecessarily. Now the search for an idle core can actually
cache one idle candidate it finds. It's a straight-forward patch but it
hurts the fast path when the domain has spare capacity and similar to
the overloaded state, we cannot detect spare capacity in advance.

Ok, I can dump the patch and think of something else.

Thanks for the review!
