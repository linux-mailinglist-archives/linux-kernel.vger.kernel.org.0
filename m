Some related logs from IRC:

2019-07-10 19:42:49     danvet  ickle, is there an idiot guide to reasonabl=
e fast blending/composing with the cpu?
2019-07-10 19:43:13     danvet  for vkms, so maitainability is high on the =
wishlist, but it needs to be somewhat fast to be able to keep up
2019-07-10 19:44:02     ickle   pixman for rectangles
2019-07-10 19:45:00     ickle   if you want reasonably fast, you want simd
2019-07-10 19:45:16     ickle   so better to use some prebaked library
2019-07-10 19:45:38     ickle   but within vkms?
2019-07-10 19:45:48     ickle   or just for igt/vkms?
2019-07-10 19:46:40     ickle   within vkms for writeback blending I guess
2019-07-10 19:51:38     ickle   http://paste.debian.net/1091097/

 compositor refactoring?
2019-07-10 19:55:21     emersion        are we still really using macros in=

2019-07-10 19:56:44     emersion        is this coming from pixman, ickle?

2019-07-10 19:57:48     emersion        yeah, that's a good idea
2019-07-10 19:57:49     ickle   or argb32 actually
2019-07-10 19:58:01     emersion        (asking for the source because lice=

2019-07-10 20:01:34     danvet  ickle, yeah vkms in the kernel
2019-07-10 20:02:41     danvet  also might need more than 8 bits ...
2019-07-10 20:02:57     danvet  and kinda hoped I could just tell gcc to si=
mdify it for me
2019-07-10 20:03:23     danvet  emersion, compositor refactoring
2019-07-10 20:03:46     danvet  ickle, higher level I figured something lik=
e a fetch fifo in a standard format
2019-07-10 20:04:02     danvet  with some drm_format->standard format conve=
rsion tools
2019-07-10 20:04:08     danvet  and then one blender
2019-07-10 20:04:39     danvet  and then either add that to the crc and tos=
s it (again maybe scanline-by-scanline, or whatever fits reasonable into l1=
$ all together)
2019-07-10 20:04:44     danvet  or dump it into writeback
2019-07-10 20:08:25     danvet  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Vector-E=
xtensions.html <- this stuff essentially, using generics
2019-07-10 20:08:38     danvet  *generic intrinsics
2019-07-10 20:08:49     danvet  or is that going to be real awful?
2019-07-10 20:09:35     ickle   shouldn't be required for _basic_ blending
2019-07-10 20:09:52     danvet  yeah I think all we want is premultiplied a=
lpha
2019-07-10 20:09:53     ickle   if all you need is an over operator, then g=
cc should be pretty good

has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
2019-07-10 20:09:59     danvet  maybe some yuv->rgb
2019-07-10 20:10:19     danvet  expanding from whatever silly format we hav=
e to the right vector
2019-07-10 20:10:33     emersion        what would be your universal format=
?
2019-07-10 20:10:46     danvet  a16r16b16g16
2019-07-10 20:10:50     danvet  except if gcc barfs on that
2019-07-10 20:11:02     danvet  or maybe go all in on 4x float :-)
2019-07-10 20:11:10     emersion        eh
2019-07-10 20:11:29     emersion        fp16 would work, but would also mea=
n rounding errors, probably?
2019-07-10 20:11:35     danvet  uint16 is not going to be awesome for hdr, =
but good enough for everything else
2019-07-10 20:11:42     danvet  no cpu has fp16
2019-07-10 20:11:52     emersion        ah, fp32
2019-07-10 20:11:57     krh     wait for avx1024
2019-07-10 20:12:01     emersion        seems kind of overkill
2019-07-10 20:12:01     danvet  fg32 is probably fastest option we can get =
on common hw
2019-07-10 20:12:12     danvet  krh, very much aiming for good enough here
2019-07-10 20:12:26     ickle   one plan is to sneak ksim into the kernel a=
s generic gpu-on-x86
2019-07-10 20:12:52     krh     can the kernel use avx2?
2019-07-10 20:13:05     danvet  well, all stuff I'd need to figure out
2019-07-10 20:13:07     danvet  I hope so
2019-07-10 20:13:12     ickle   it can
2019-07-10 20:13:19     ickle   easier than mmx
2019-07-10 20:13:49     emersion        when you say gcc barfs on a16r16b16=
g16: why?
2019-07-10 20:13:57     danvet  kernel_fpu_begin/end + telling gcc to optim=
ize the crap out of the file with the blending functions
2019-07-10 20:14:11     emersion        uint64 too hard for gcc to optimize=
?
2019-07-10 20:14:14     danvet  emersion, I haven't checked, but if it gene=
rates silly code then might be better to go with fp32
2019-07-10 20:14:28     vsyrjala        the compiler always generates silly=
 code
2019-07-10 20:14:30     danvet  ideally it should all boil down to sse/avx
2019-07-10 20:14:32     emersion        ahah
2019-07-10 20:14:51     danvet  and ideally all with generic intrinsics so =
the arm folks don't freak out
2019-07-10 20:15:07     -->     sandeep (~sandeep@134.134.139.76) has joine=
d #intel-gfx
2019-07-10 20:15:23     emersion        +1 for generic intrinsics
2019-07-10 20:15:42     danvet  the conversion from uint to fp32 might be h=
ilarious
2019-07-10 20:15:50     emersion        yeah, probably
2019-07-10 20:15:52     danvet  perhaps the one place where we want to use =
an sse or avx intrinsic
2019-07-10 20:16:19     danvet  especially if we convert to simd16 instead =
of something like 4x4
2019-07-10 20:16:22     emersion        we should probably do some little e=
xperiments before doing anything
2019-07-10 20:16:24     danvet  simd4x4
2019-07-10 20:16:31     danvet  yeah
2019-07-10 20:16:41     danvet  that's why I'm asking here, since I have ro=
ughly 0 clue about this
2019-07-10 20:17:48     danvet  I don't think we ever need a dot or anythin=
g like that, so plain simd is propably best
2019-07-10 20:18:07     danvet  except the input is usually 4x or 3x vector=
s
2019-07-10 20:18:07     emersion        a dot?
2019-07-10 20:18:12     danvet  dot product
2019-07-10 20:18:14     emersion        ah
2019-07-10 20:18:15     danvet  for vertex shaders
2019-07-10 20:18:20     emersion        yeah, probably not
2019-07-10 20:18:21     bwidawsk        danvet=E2=80=BA btw, I think "gener=
ic intrinsic" is an ARM thing
2019-07-10 20:18:29     bwidawsk        I think everywhere else, they just =
say intrinsic
2019-07-10 20:18:41     bwidawsk        at least, I've never heard the gene=
ric prefix other than ARM compiler
2019-07-10 20:19:19     vsyrjala        just make the max supported resolut=
ion 8x8 or something and speed shouldn't be a huge issue
2019-07-10 20:19:30     emersion        i think he meant generic intrinsic =
vs. sse/avx/whatever
2019-07-10 20:19:49     bwidawsk        emersion=E2=80=BA yes, I figured ou=
t what he meant, I just mentioned it because it was a source of confusion
2019-07-10 20:19:52     emersion        vsyrjala, helpful as always :)
2019-07-10 20:20:32     danvet  oh gcc has all the casting implementing in =
the intrinsics too
2019-07-10 20:20:50     danvet  bwidawsk, gcc manpage also calls them gener=
ic intrinsics
2019-07-10 20:21:25     bwidawsk        danvet=E2=80=BA not my gcc manpage
2019-07-10 20:21:40     danvet  well "generic vector operations"
2019-07-10 20:21:46     danvet  ^^ that what you meant?
2019-07-10 20:22:03     danvet  vs "machine-specific vector intrinsics"
2019-07-10 20:22:38     bwidawsk        I thought the generic intrinsic ter=
m came from ARM's proprietary compiler
2019-07-10 20:22:40     bwidawsk        but I might be wrong
