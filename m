For clocks, regualtors, and pinctrl, that dependency is already implicit
in the consumer node's properties. We should be able to derive those
dependencies within the kernel.

Can you give an example of where a dependency is not implicit in an
existing binding?

Whether something is a mandatory dependency will depend on the driver
and dynamic runtime details more than it will depend on the hardware.

For example, assume I have an IP block that functions as both a
clocksource and a watchdog that can reset the system, with those two
functions derived from separate input clocks.

I could use the device as just a clocksource, or as just a watchdog, and
neither feature in isolation is necessarily mandatory for the device to
be somewhat useful to the OS.

We need better ways of dynamically providing and managing this
information. For example, if a driver could register its dynamic
dependencies at probe (or some new pre-probe callback), we'd be able to
notify it immediately when its dependencies are available.

Thanks,
Mark.
