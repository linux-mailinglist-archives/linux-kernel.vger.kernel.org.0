The c3600 doesn't have any PCI-X slots (only PCI) as far as I can tell from user manuals.

The SY-PCX40009 PCI-X card that I have says it supports two models: 32-bit at 66 MHz and 64-bit
at 133 MHz.  The 32-bit slots in c3600 are 33 MHz.  Whether the card will work at 33 MHz is not
clear.  The card says it's backward compatible to PCI 2.3.
