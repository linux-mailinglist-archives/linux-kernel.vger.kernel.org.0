Thanks to you and Jernej for pointing me at this.  It seems likely
that patch by itself would solve problems we found and I'll pick that
into my tree.

Probably my patch is no longer quite as useful atop yours, but I'll
still post a v2 since (in theory) folks that aren't using I2S might
find it useful.  I guess it's also possible (?) that picking an N
where CTS would be able to be integral has some type of advantage,
even with auto CTS?

Sure.  I'm probably not going to be able to post the patch to actually
use it, so I guess we could just not bother applying the 2nd patch
unless someone ever needs it.
