I tried Dmitry's patch on Intel Stratix10 platform and it works.

I added one minor change on the top of Dmitry's patch, since I think we 
need add one additional check prior to device_add_groups(). To align 
with Dmitry's patch, I also change my code to use the new dev_groups 
pointer in the struct of device_driver.

My changes are below,
