Agree with above scenario, but i don't see a reason why would a rpmh client send the same request twice.

Let me explain...

while first request is a proper one (already handled in rpmh driver), second is again duplicate
of first without any change.

when this duplicate request is triggered, resource may be in its own low power mode, when this
extra/duplicate command is sent, it needs to come out of low power mode and apply the newly requested
level but it is already at that level, so it will immediatly ack back without doing any real level
transition, and it will again go back to sleep. so there can be a small power hit.

and also for "ACTIVE" we need to handle this unnecessary ack interrupt at CPU, so CPU
(if it is in some low power mode where this interrupt is affined to) need to wake up and
handle this interrupt, again taking possible power hit from CPU point.

whats more?

while this whole unnecessary ping-pong happens in HW and SW, client may be waiting if its a blocking call.

rpmh client is expected to "aggregate" and finally do rpmh transaction "only if"
aggregated final level differs from what resource is already having.

if they are not doing this, then IMO, this is something to be addressed from client side.

Agree, but i guess, this is a hit expected with non-OSI to do rpm_flush() immediately.

yes this still need to keep.

IMO, its uncessary warning that too with arbitrary number (1000).
rpmh clients are not expected to bombard it with thousands of requests, as i explained
above, they need to aggregate and make rpmh request only when real level transistion
needed.

and there is already a message (in rpmh_rsc_send_data()) to tell if all TCS are occupied
and rpmh will retry to send pending request. "TCS Busy, retrying RPMH message send"
