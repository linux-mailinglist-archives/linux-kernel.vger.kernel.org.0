No that's not what I was thinking, actually.  Unless somebody can come up
with a good reason to the contrary, just disabling that behavior globally
strikes me as the right thing to do.

Assuming there are no objections, it would be great to have this as a
patch with a proper changelog.  Said changelog should describe all of the
changes we'll see in the output with that option set, though, so there
are no surprises later.

Thanks,
