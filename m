ok-me and Sean Paul did some playing around with available_pbn and full_pbn
(I'll get into this one in a moment), and I also played around with a couple
of different hubs and have a much better understanding of how this should work
now.

So: first off tl;dr available_pbn is absolutely not what we want in basically
any scenario, we actually want to use the full_pbn field that we get when
sending ENUM_PATH_RESOURCES. Second, full_pbn represents the _smallest_ bandwidth limitation encountered in the path between the root MSTB and each connected sink. Remember that there's technically a DisplayPort link trained between each branch device going down the topology, so that bandwidth limitation basically equates to "what is the lowest trained link rate that exists down the path to this port?". This also means that full_pbn will potentially change every time a new connector is plugged in, as some hubs will be clever and optimize the link rate they decide to use. Likewise, since there's not going to be anything trained on a disconnected port (e.g. ddps=0) there's no point in keeping full_pbn around for disconnected ports, since otherwise we might let userspace see a connected port with a stale full_pbn value.

So-IMHO the behavior of not letting connectors show as connected until we also
have their full_pbn probed should definitely be the right solution here.
Especially if we want to eventually start pruning modes based on full_pbn at
some point in the future.
