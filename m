We still need to check there is no duplicate request in a TCS for SLEEP 
and WAKE as well.

find_match() checks if the request already exist for a resource then 
update with new value, in a way preventing new request to go in

when one already exists. I am ok to remove this function since after [1] 
we always fully invalidate and then re-write and little point in

finding a match now. However we need to use check_for_req_inflight() 
from tcs_ctrl_write() with little modification to ignore tcs_is_free()

check if is called from tcs_ctrlr_write().

After this change on 9th change in your series,  please move it before 
current patch in series.

please also keep dependency on [1] for 9th change.
