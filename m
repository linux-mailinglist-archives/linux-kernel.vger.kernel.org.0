So do I :) That's the newer "D06CS" board.

without really knowing the topology of the system.

So it's 2x socket, each socket has 2x CPU dies, and each die has 6 
clusters of 4 CPUs, which gives 96 in total.

Is that even for managed interrupts? We're testing the storage 
controller which uses managed interrupts. I should have made that clearer.

Seems that way.

So this is a mystery to me:

But mpstat reports for CPU62:

12:44:58 AM  CPU    %usr   %nice    %sys %iowait    %irq   %soft  %steal 
  %guest  %gnice   %idle

    0.00    6.54   25.23

I don't know what interrupts they are...

It's the "hisi_sas_v3_hw cq" interrupts which we're interested in.

and that

So both storage controllers (which we're interested in for this test) 
are on socket #0, node #0.

Again, managed, so I don't think it's possible.

Thanks,
