+The validator tracks the 'usage state' of lock-classes, and it tracks
+the dependencies between different lock-classes. Lock usage indicates
+how a lock is used with regard to its IRQ contexts, while lock
+dependency can be understood as lock order, where L1 -> L2 suggests that
+a task is attempting to acquire L2 while holding L1. From lockdep's
+perspective, the two locks (L1 and L2) are not necessarily related; that
+dependency just means the order ever happened. The validator maintains a
+continuing effort to prove lock usages and dependencies are correct or
+the validator will shoot a splat if incorrect.
+
+A lock-class's behavior is constructed by its instances collectively:
+when the first instance of a lock-class is used after bootup the class
+gets registered, then all (subsequent) instances will be mapped to the
+class and hence their usages and dependecies will contribute to those of
+the class. A lock-class does not go away when a lock instance does, but
+it can be removed if the memory space of the lock class (static or
+dynamic) is reclaimed, this happens for example when a module is
+unloaded or a workqueue is destroyed.

+where the 4 usages can be:
 - 'ever held in STATE context'
 - 'ever held as readlock in STATE context'
 - 'ever held with STATE enabled'
 - 'ever held as readlock with STATE enabled'
 
-Where STATE can be either one of (kernel/locking/lockdep_states.h)
- - hardirq
- - softirq
+where the n STATEs are coded in kernel/locking/lockdep_states.h and as of
+now they include:
+- hardirq
+- softirq
 
+where the last 1 category is:
 - 'ever used'                                       [ == !unused        ]

-Unused mutexes cannot be part of the cause of an error.
+The bits are illustrated with an example:

+                         ||||

+For a given STATE, whether the lock is ever acquired in that STATE
+context and whether that STATE is enabled yields four possible cases as
+shown in the table below. The bit character is able to indicate which
+exact case is for the lock as of the reporting time.
+
+   -------------------------------------------

+  |-------------------------------------------|
+  | ever in irq  |      ?      |       -      |
+  |-------------------------------------------|
+  | never in irq |      +      |       .      |
+   -------------------------------------------
+
+The character '-' suggests irq is disabled because if otherwise the
+charactor '?' would have been shown instead. Similar deduction can be
+applied for '+' too.

+Unused locks (e.g., mutexes) cannot be part of the cause of an error.
