Well that's something I don't have straight answer yet. I am undecided on
per-protocol callback or just one callback. Yes, the platform can get
the same notification to multiple agents if they have subscribe for the
same. It doesn't matter if you have one or multiple agents on you system.
You have 2 actually: Linux and the Platform(which runs this SCMI compliant
firmware). It could be dedicated power controller or you secure side
firmware.

That's fine. I am interested to know the user, but I understand if you
can't talk about it.

Thanks, I can add a note to ensure it's not lost, you raised valid points
in review.
