Good point. I forgot the handover logic. Well, it is enabled only
around call_console_drivers(). Therefore it is not under
lockbuf_lock.

I had in mind some infinite loop or deadlock in vprintk_store().
There was at least one long time ago (warning triggered
by leap second).

Nested printk() should not be problem thanks to printk_safe.

Also printk_safe_flush_on_panic() is safe because it checks whether
the lock is available.

The problem is kmsg_dump() and console_unlock() called from
console_unblank() and console_flush_on_panic(). They do not
check whether the lock is available.


This patch does not help in all possible scenarios. But I still
believe that it will help in some.

Well, I am primary interested into the 2nd patch. It fixes
a real life bug report.

Best Regards,
Petr
