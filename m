In-Reply-To: <cover.1560045490.git.mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
References: <cover.1560045490.git.mchehab+samsung@kernel.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The conversion is actually:
  - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
  - fix tables markups;
  - add some lists markups;
  - mark literal blocks;
  - adjust title markups.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

 co.local.red are entries that were brought in through FBIOGETCMAP which come
 directly from the info->cmap.red that was listed above. The prgb is the rgb
 that the app wants to match to. The above code is doing what looks like a least
 squares matching function. That's why the cmap entries can't be set to the left
 hand side boundaries of a color range.

+noinverse    show true colors on screen. It is default.
+dev:X        bind driver to device X. Driver numbers device from 0 up to N,

+	     lspci lists devices in this order.
+	     Default is `every` known device.
+nohwcursor   disables hardware cursor (use software cursor instead).
+hwcursor     enables hardware cursor. It is default. If you are using
+	     non-accelerated mode (`noaccel` or `fbset -accel false`), software
+	     cursor is used (except for text mode).
+noblink      disables cursor blinking. Cursor in text mode always blinks (hw
+	     limitation).
+blink        enables cursor blinking. It is default.
+nofastfont   disables fastfont feature. It is default.
+fastfont:X   enables fastfont feature. X specifies size of memory reserved for

+============
 
-	  This driver (should) work on ix86, with "late" 2.2.x kernel (tested
-	with x = 19) and "recent" 2.4.x kernel, as a module or compiled in.
-	  It has been included in mainstream kernel since the infamous 2.4.10.
-	  You can apply the patches found in sstfb/kernel/*-2.{2|4}.x.patch,
-	and copy sstfb.c to linux/drivers/video/, or apply a single patch, 
-	sstfb/patch-2.{2|4}.x-sstfb-yymmdd to your linux source tree.

 Tools

-		con2fb /dev/fb1 /dev/tty5
-	 - sst_dbg_vgapass , changes vga passthrou. You have to recompile the

-		sst_dbg_vgapass /dev/fb1 0 (disables vga cable)

 Bugs
+====
 
-	- DO NOT use glide while the sstfb module is in, you'll most likely
-	hang your computer.
-	- If you see some artefacts (pixels not cleaning and stuff like that), 
-	try turning off clipping (clipping=0), and/or using slowpci
-	- the driver don't detect the 4Mb frame buffer voodoos, it seems that
-	the 2 last Mbs wrap around. looking into that .
-	- The driver is 16 bpp only, 24/32 won't work.
-	- The driver is not your_favorite_toy-safe. this includes SMP...
-          [Actually from inspection it seems to be safe - Alan]
-	- When using XFree86 FBdev (X over fbdev) you may see strange color
-	patterns at the border of your windows (the pixels lose the lowest

+-------------------------
     The following files exist in /proc/viafb
 
     supported_output_devices
+	This read-only file contains a full ',' separated list containing all
+	output devices that could be available on your platform. It is likely
+	that not all of those have a connector on your hardware but it should
+	provide a good starting point to figure out which of those names match
+	a real connector.
+
+	Example::
+
+		# cat /proc/viafb/supported_output_devices
+
+    iga1/output_devices, iga2/output_devices
+	These two files are readable and writable. iga1 and iga2 are the two
+	independent units that produce the screen image. Those images can be
+	forwarded to one or more output devices. Reading those files is a way
+	to query which output devices are currently used by an iga.
+
+	Example::
+
+		# cat /proc/viafb/iga1/output_devices
+
+	If there are no output devices printed the output of this iga is lost.
+	This can happen for example if only one (the other) iga is used.
+	Writing to these files allows adjusting the output devices during
+	runtime. One can add new devices, remove existing ones or switch
+	between igas. Essentially you can write a ',' separated list of device
+	names (or a single one) in the same format as the output to those
+	files. You can add a '+' or '-' as a prefix allowing simple addition
+	and removal of devices. So a prefix '+' adds the devices from your list
+	to the already existing ones, '-' removes the listed devices from the
+	existing ones and if no prefix is given it replaces all existing ones
+	with the listed ones. If you remove devices they are expected to turn
+	off. If you add devices that are already part of the other iga they are
+	removed there and added to the new one.
+
+	Examples:
+
+	Add CRT as output device to iga1::
+
+		# echo +CRT > /proc/viafb/iga1/output_devices
+
+	Remove (turn off) DVP1 and LVDS1 as output devices of iga2::
+
+		# echo -DVP1,LVDS1 > /proc/viafb/iga2/output_devices
+
+	Replace all iga1 output devices by CRT::
+
+		# echo CRT > /proc/viafb/iga1/output_devices
