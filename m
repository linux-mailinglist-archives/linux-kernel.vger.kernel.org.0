Yeah. I even explained some cases where it wouldn't work.

If we get a microcode update that isn't late loadable, then yes, we have
to do something different.

That doesn't mean that late loading isn't still useful. In practice, it
can be very valuable. It isn't bad or dangerous in vast majority of
cases. We haven't had a microcode update across all of the models of
Intel CPUs we have (going back a handful of generations) in the past
almost two years that wasn't safely late loadable.

Just as I can't know for sure that every future microcode update will be
safely late loadable, you can't know for sure that every future microcode
update won't be safely late loadable.

We are well aware of the downsides of late microcode loading and live
patching. However, like I said, it's currently the best tools available.

We are certainly looking at other options, but some aren't feasible for
mitigating security vulnerabilities where time to getting patched is
very much important.

Depends on what kind of patch is needed. Livepatching, while having it's
own set of problems, has been very valuable for us.

We do use other techniques as well particularly when it's not time
sensitive.

It very much makes it right because it's still a tool that can be used
safely in the right cases. Just because it can't be used 100% of the time
(even if it is close to that in practice) doesn't make it magically unsafe
either.

I don't have a particular use case for the patchset at hand and I'm
certainly not arguing for or against this patchset.

But I do get concerned when there is talk about removing a feature we
currently use extensively.

I'm happy to hear it will likely not be removed and I hope it was partly
because I spoke up to show that is actively being used and it's important
to us.
