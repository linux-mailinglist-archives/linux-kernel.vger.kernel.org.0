Nice summary, that's exactly what it is :)

I haven't been staring at this code for as long as you, but since we have
logic at wakeup to do a push, I think we need something here anyway for unfit
tasks.

Fixing select_task_rq_rt() to better balance tasks will help a lot in general,
but if that was enough already then why do we need to consider a push at the
wakeup at all then?

AFAIU, in SMP the whole push-pull mechanism is racy and we introduce redundancy
at taking the decision on various points to ensure we minimize this racy nature
of SMP systems. Anything could have happened between the time we called
select_task_rq_rt() and the wakeup, so we double check again before we finally
go and run. That's how I interpret it.

I am open to hear about other alternatives first anyway. Your help has been
much appreciated so far.

Thanks
