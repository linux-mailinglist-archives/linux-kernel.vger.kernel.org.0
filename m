I tend to agree that use of GB pages is generally going to be in workloads
that will do a one time setup/allocation/initialization of all the pages
it will use.  These improvements will help most in those workloads.

Workloads which include random faults should still benefit.  And, yes
the code could be made even better by taking the faulting address into
account.

I would be happy to see this go forward after addressing the few nits
mentioned by Andrew.  However, I myself can not comment with authority
on the low level x86 specific code.
