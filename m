I didn't follow the discussion closely enough to understand the 
motivation behind "add/sub" rather than "restore" %rsp. Now I understand 
and I agree with you that the requested change is unnecessary.

%rbx can always be restored as long as it is saved at a fixed offset 
from %rbp. For example, given the standard prolog below:

	push	%rbp
	mov	%rsp, %rbp
	push	%rbx

It can be paired with the following standard epilog:

	mov	-8(%rbp), %rbx
	leave
	ret

Alternatively, given "red zone" of 128 bytes, the following epilog will 
also work:

	leave
	mov	-0x10(%rsp), %rbx
	ret

In no cases do we have to worry about enclave mucking the stack as long 
as %rbp is preserved.

Per discussion above, this is useful only if the enclave has problem 
cleaning up its own mess left on the untrusted stack, and the exit 
handler wants to EENTER the enclave again by returning to __vdso...(). 
It sounds very uncommon to me, and more like a bug than an expected 
behavior. Are there any existing code doing this or any particular 
application that needs this. If no, I'd say not to do it.
