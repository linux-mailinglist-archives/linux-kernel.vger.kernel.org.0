Thanks for your patch! I had to go into the ML and find out the series where this
patch belongs to and seen that you have already received some feedback, but I think
a summary is worth:

- you should look if it is possible to make .debugfs_init hook return void, it would
  simplify the cleanup in the drivers by not having to return 0.
- you should put in each driver patch a note that drm_debugfs_create_files() always
  returns 0 since 987d65d01356 (drm: debugfs: make drm_debugfs_create_files() never fail)
  so that people don't have to hunt in the git history for clues.
- Make all the changes into a series

With that, you can have my Acked-by: Liviu Dudau <liviu.dudau@arm.com>

Best regards,
Liviu
