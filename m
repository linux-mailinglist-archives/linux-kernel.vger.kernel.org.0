Thanks for your comments.

As you can see, except for patch [05/10], other commits only modify the type
of "order". So the change is not big.

For the benefit, "order" may be negative, which is confusing and weird.
There is no good reason not to do this since it can be avoided.

Yes, you are right.
I use "stress" for stress testing, and made some small code coverage testing.

As you said, I need more ideas and comments about testing.
Any suggestions for testing?

Thanks again.
