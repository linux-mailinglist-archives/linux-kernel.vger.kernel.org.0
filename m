It matters for this machine, because it's for storage and there is
a watchdog and the time consuming triggers the watchdog.

Sorry, I don't have such data, as the arch timer is not initialized
and I didn't see the time stamp at this point, but I read the cycles
from arch timer before and after the time consuming function to get
how much time consumed.

Thank you very much for taking care of this :)

I think Jia He no longer works for HXT, if don't mind, I can repost
this patch set with Jia He's authority unchanged.

Thanks
