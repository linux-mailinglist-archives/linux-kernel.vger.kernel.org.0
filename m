I believe you are correct.  There is code that limits KASLR's choice
of phyiscal addresses to valid RAM locations.  There are no bugs in it
that I've seen.

It's just that the 1G mapping includes wide regions of physical
address space on either or both sides of the chosen physical space for
the kernel, which are not limited to valid RAM regions, allowing
speculative accesses into reserved regions if the chosen kernel
physical address is close enough to one of them.
