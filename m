I'm OK with that. I just wanted to make sure we will apply the same
requirements to the upcoming DL capacity awareness implementation. Not
catering for this use case means that we can skip the migrate callback
from Luca's initial DL capacity awareness patch-set.

I still would prefer to export rt_task_fits_capacity() via
kernel/sched/sched.h but I won't insist on that detail:
