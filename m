I like Sasha's PATCH v2 better, but if Kees insists on NACK'ing it then
I suggest that we apply Sasha's first revision of the patch instead.
I think either revision is an improvement on the status quo.

Maybe, but from my perspective common past issues with Linux kernel bugs
reported to linux-distros were:

- The reporter having been directed to post from elsewhere (and I
suspect this documentation file) without being aware of list policy.

- The reporter not mentioning (and sometimes not replying even when
asked) whether they're also coordinating with security@k.o or whether
they want someone on linux-distros to help coordinate with security@k.o.
(Maybe this is something we want to write about here.)

- The Linux kernel bug having been introduced too recently to be of much
interest to distros.

This happens too.  Regarding missing the "[vs]" detail, technically
there are also a number of other conditions that also let the message
through, but those are changing and are deliberately not advertised.

Right.

Do you mean leaks to *BSD security teams or to the public?  I'm not
aware of past leaks to the public via the non-Linux distros present on
the distros@ list.  Are you?
