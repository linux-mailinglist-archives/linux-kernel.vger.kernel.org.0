I don't think that's too much to ask, the usecase needs to
be expressed somewhere whether in code or DT properties.

Rob suggest using GPIOs but represent them in the Linux kernel
as resets.

This would be a semantic effect of the line being named "reset-gpios"
as Rob pointed out. Name implies usage. We can formalize it
with DT YAML as well, these days, then it is impossible to get it
wrong, as long as the bindings are correct.

When you call the reset subsystem to create the reset handle
it can be instructed to look for a GPIO, possibly shared, and
this way replace the current explicit GPIO handling code
in the driver. It will just look as a reset no matter how many
other device or just this one is using it.

Answered by explict interpretation of DT bindings
named "reset-gpios". Those are resets, nothing else.

That can be said about literally anything we do in any
framework we design. Rough consensus and running code.
Bad paths will be taken sometimes, hopefully not too much.
We clean up the mess we create and refactor as we go
along, it is always optimistic design.

We don't try to fix that now, if it's not broken don't fix it.
Let's try to fix the reset problem instead.
