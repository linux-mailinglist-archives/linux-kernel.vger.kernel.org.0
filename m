Huh.  It still applies.  But I have no means of testing it.

And it looks like the reason I dropped it was that I didn't get any
response from the maintainer.  I sent a message to this effect to
linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org and linux@arm.linux.org.uk on May
21, 2015.

So here it is again.  ;-)

I have queued this locally.  Left to myself, I add the two of you on its
Cc: list and run it through my normal process.  But given the history,
I would still want either an ack from the maintainer or, better, for
the maintainer to take the patch.

Or is there a better way for us to proceed on this?

							Thanx, Paul

arm: Use common outgoing-CPU-notification code

This commit removes the open-coded CPU-offline notification with new
common code.  In particular, this change avoids calling scheduler code
using RCU from an offline CPU that RCU is ignoring.  This is a minimal
change.  A more intrusive change might invoke the cpu_check_up_prepare()
and cpu_set_state_online() functions at CPU-online time, which would
allow onlining throw an error if the CPU did not go offline properly.
