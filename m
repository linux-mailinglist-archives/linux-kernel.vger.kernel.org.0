Well it does not make much of a difference whether we do the above or
!(tifn & _TIF_IO_BITMAP). We always end up in that code when one of the
involved tasks has TIF_IO_BITMAP set. I decided to use the sched out check
because that makes it clear that this is the end of the valid I/O
bitmap. If the next task has TIF_IO_BITMAP set as well, then it will anyway
end up in the exit to user mode update code. Clearing it here ensures that
even if the exit to user mode malfunctions the bitmap cannot be leaked.

It does.

No, the TIF_IO_BITMAP check is done once after the loop has run and it
would not make any sense in the loop as TIF_IO_BITMAP cannot be cleared
there and we'd loop forever. The other usermode loop flags are transient.
