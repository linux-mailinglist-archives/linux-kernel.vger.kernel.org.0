Subject: [PATCH v3] hwspinlock: allow sharing of hwspinlocks

Allow several clients to request (hwspin_lock_request_specific()) the
same lock.
In addition to that, protect a given lock from being locked
(hwspin_trylock{_...}()) by more that one client at a time.

Since the RAW and IN_ATOMIC modes do not implement that protection
(unlike the default, IRQ and IRQSTATE modes that make use of
spin_lock{_irq, _irqsave}), protect __hwspin_trylock with the atomic
bitop test_and_set_bit().
This bitop is atomic (SMP-safe), does not disable neither preemption
nor interrupts, hence it preserves the RAW and IN_ATOMIC modes
constraints.

Signed-off-by: Fabien Dessenne <fabien.dessenne@st.com>
---
Changes since v2:
- Drop the DeviceTree-based implementation.
- Do not let the choice between exclusive and shared usage : locks are
  always shared.
- Add a protection (atomic bitop) working in any modes to allow safe
  sharing between clients.

Changes since v1:
- Removed useless 'status = "okay"' from stm32mp157c.dtsi
