No, it uses is_acpi_reserved() (it's called indirectly so might be well
hidden) to parse DSDT to find a reserved resource in it and size MCFG
area accordingly. setup_mcfg_map() is called for every root bus
discovered and indeed tries to evaluate _CBA but at this point
pci_mmcfg_late_init() has already finished MCFG registration for every
cold-plugged bus (which information is described in MCFG table) so those
calls are dummy.

setup_mcfg_map() calls are done in order of root bus discovery which
happens *after* the previous root bus has been enumerated. So the order
is: call setup_mcfg_map() for root bus 0, find that
pci_mmcfg_late_init() has finished MCFG area registration, perform PCI
enumeration of bus 0, call xen_add_device() for every device there, call
setup_mcfg_map() for root bus X, etc.
