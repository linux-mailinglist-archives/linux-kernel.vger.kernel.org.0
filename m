It depends a bit on how it all works I suppose (I'm not too clear on the
details).

Suppose the linker appends translation units at (at least) 32 bytes
alignment, but the function alignment inside the translation unit is
smaller, then it could still work, because the assembler (which is going
to insert NOPs to avoid instructions being in the 'wrong' place) can
still know the offset.

If the linker is going to be fancy (say LTO) and move code around inside
sections/translation units, then this goes out the window obviously.

The same with this fine-grained-randomization, if the section alignment
is smaller than 32 bytes, the offset is going to change and the
mitigation will be nullified.

I'll leave it to others to figure out the exact details. But afaict it
should be possible to have fine-grained-randomization and preserve the
workaround in the end.
