Hi!

Which bus is used for audio transfer on your device? If it is I2S, which is 
commonly used, then please be aware of this patch:
https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dri-devel/2019-June/221539.html

It avoids exact N/CTS calculation by enabling auto detection. It is well 
tested on multiple SoCs from Allwinner, Amlogic and Rockchip.

Best regards,
Jernej
