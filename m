True.

Hmm, I do just realize that the regulator subsystem turns off regulators
which are not in use from its pov, which would be kinda bad here.

It does this when the kernel is done initializing / switches to the
initrd or directly to the rootfs. Its been a while since I've last touched
this. Have you tried building the regulator driver (and mfd stuff and i2c
controller, etc.) into the kernel, so that the regulators work without modu=
les?

I'm afraid that if you do that they will all get turned off, with expecting
results... Although I guess the regulator subsystem may skip this step for
regulators without any constrains, to be sure I would have to re-read the c=
ode.

Anyways this is a serious concern which we need to resolve.

Ah I see, the reason I was asking is because I only know of three CHT
devices using a Whiskey Cove PMIC (instead of the AXP288, Crystal Cove or
TI one): the GPD Win, GPD pocket and one of the Lenovo Book versions
(the one with the CHT SoC).

Lets say I want to test this patch-set on one of the GPD devices,
I guess I need an UHS-I capable card and then what should I see
in sysfs for the mmc settings ?

Regards,

Hans
