For DST2 heuristic "share-with-prev" will not work because if prev (DST1)
uses old AV (AV_OLD_1) and AV_OLD_1->parent isn't SRC2->AV (AV0).
So DST2 could only pick another old AV or allocate new.

My patch uses condition dst->prev->anon_vma->parent == src->anon_vma rather
than obvious src->prev->anon_vma == src->anon_vma because in this way it
eliminates all unwanted corner cases and explicitly verifies that we going to
share related anon-vma.

Heuristic "reuse-old" uses fact that VMA links and AV parent chain are tracked
independently: when VMA reuses old AV it still links to all related AV even
if VMA->AV points into some old AV in the middle of inheritance chain.
