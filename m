That looks like potentially missing Power domain support, either in the kernel
or from the firmware.

The Coresight components are also AMBA devices (with primecell compatible)
and thus the AMBA bus layer does some probing to check the PIDRx registers
to match the driver. The AMBA layer does try to get the power to the
component, but someone is lying that it is powered.
