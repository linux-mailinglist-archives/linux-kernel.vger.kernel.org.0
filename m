I see. You want below functions for environments where current thread can
fail to resume execution for long if current thread once reschedules (e.g.
UP kernel, many threads contended on one CPU).

/*
 * Give other threads CPU time, unless current thread was already killed.
 * Used when we prefer killed threads to continue execution (in a hope that
 * killed threads terminate quickly) over giving other threads CPU time.
 */
signed long __sched schedule_timeout_killable_expedited(signed long timeout)
{
	if (unlikely(fatal_signal_pending(current)))
		return timeout;
	return schedule_timeout_killable(timeout);
}

/*
 * Latency reduction via explicit rescheduling in places that are safe,
 * but becomes no-op if current thread was already killed. Used when we
 * prefer killed threads to continue execution (in a hope that killed
 * threads terminate quickly) over giving other threads CPU time.
 */
int cond_resched_expedited(void)
{
	if (unlikely(fatal_signal_pending(current)))
		return 0;
	return cond_resched();
}

As long as there is schedule_timeout_killable(), I'm fine with adding
cond_resched() in other places.

Please go ahead.
