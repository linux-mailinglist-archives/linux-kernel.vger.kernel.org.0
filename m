I was referring to the combination of these two patches:

9748e1d87573  Thomas Petazzoni  mtd: nand: add support for Micron on-die ECC
cb2bf403a462  Chris Packham  mtd: rawnand: micron: allow forced on-die ECC

Agreed. I'll ask my contact at Micron if such a document exists and
if they would be willing to share it.

Yes. I used the term HW ECC as that is how it is referenced in the
device tree (nand-ecc-mode = "hw") and the driver (NAND_ECC_HW).

That's understandable. I'll look into this a little more and see if it's
feasible to implement a static table to handle this.

Thanks,
