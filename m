To me it looks straight forward. We get a description of MFD and split it
accordingly. Look at the rest of Intel PMIC drivers, they are built on the
same principles.

"Thanks" to firmware here, that does more, than on other PMICs, that's why we
have several IRQ resources, but from hardware point of view it's still an MFD.

It seems some people would like to bring up Shady Cove PMIC support in the
future, which seems to behave in a similar way, while the (most of the) drivers
can be re-used.

So, for me it will look like a hack in each of PMIC driver to have additional
platform data for whatever can be passed using well-established facilities,
like device resources.
