Which r0 the above exists rule refers to, please?
Do both P0 and P1 define r0 by purpose?

Do you have any explanation how r0=x; x=2; could happen, please?

Does the ommited READ_ONCE allows to do r0 = (*y) twice
before and after *r0 = 1?
Or the two operations P1 can be called in any order?

I am sorry if it obvious. Feel free to ask me to re-read Paul's
articles on LWN more times or point me to another resources.

So, it might be even worse. Do I get it correctly?
