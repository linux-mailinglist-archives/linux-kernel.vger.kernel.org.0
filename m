Looks like GCC-4.6.4 and Clang 5 begin to support the intrinsics with -mfsgsbase,
according to their documentations:
	GCC - https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.4/gcc/X86-Built_002din-Functions.html#X86-Built_002din-Functions
	Clang - https://releases.llvm.org/5.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ClangCommandLineReference.html
