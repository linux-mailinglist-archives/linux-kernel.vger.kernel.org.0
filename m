Thanks for your work on this. Unfortunately I still think that this is
the wrong approach.
I see several problems in your patch series:
- You introduced GPIO0_PA1 as regulator enable for RockPro64.
Unfortunately Pine64 decided to disable this regulator on Board Version
2.1 (real product version), see above. I have no idea why they did this.
- You changed the i/o voltage from 3.0V to 3.3V. This is not allowed on
RK3399 I/O bank F.

Changing the i/o voltage to 3.0V/3.3V while the sd card is configured
for 1.8V is against the specification and dangerous. While experimenting
with different images (ayufan, armbian) for my newly bought RockPro64 I
killed a SD card (32GB Samsung UHS-I). I cannot reconstruct the exact
circumstances, but I'm pretty sure this happened due to the voltage
mismatch. Of course I'm not keen to experiment further with this and
kill more sd cards. This is not just an theoretical issue.

What I observed on my RockPro64:
The ROM bootloader always was able to load the next stage, maybe due to
the low initial clock of 400kHz? Also the ROM bootloader cannot change
voltage regulator settings. So if the i/o voltage still is at 1.8V and
matching the sd card setting, there is no problem for the ROM bootloader.=

So I think the normal reboot handling should be:
If the sd card can be switched off (preferred solution), do so and reset
the controller i/o voltage to 3.0V/3.3V.
If the sd card can not be switched off, make sure to leave the
controller i/o voltage at the current setting. Make sure in later boot
stages to not change the controller i/o voltage to 3.0V/3.3V when the
card is configured for 1.8V. According to the patch mentioned above this
behaviour already is implemented in linux, we also need this for the
bootloaders.
