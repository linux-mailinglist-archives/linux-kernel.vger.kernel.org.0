Hi Linus,

Please pull these arm64 fixes for -rc2. The summary is in the tag.

I was actually planning to send these in during the merge window, which
is why the branch is based on top of the previous arm64 pull rather than
-rc1. Unfortunately, due to various goings on, my ability to send
external email has been patchy (no pun intended) but here we are anyway.

I'll probably send some more fixes in later this week, but based on -rc1
to avoid conflicts.

Cheers,

Will
