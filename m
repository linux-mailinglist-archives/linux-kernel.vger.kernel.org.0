Sure, go ahead. I just meant 'map' to include not only the PFN but also
appropriate HW attributes not cause a page fault.

The function does not need to return anything. Dummy default definition
in generic MM will do nothing when arch does not override.

On arm64 with hardware-managed access flag supported, it will do nothing.
But in case its not supported the above mentioned pte update as in the
current proposal needs to be executed. The details should hide in arch
specific override.
