Sure will explore them and other similar examples. I am already working on a module
which will test various architecture page table accessors semantics as expected from
generic MM. This should help us making sure that all architectures are on same page.

Right, it makes sense to do the renaming even without considering this proposal.

All these makes it riskier for collision with other core MM paths as compared to
using a an isolated SW bit like PTE_SPECIAL exclusively for this purpose. This
is in line with using PTE_PROTNONE. PTE_SPECIAL seems to be well away from core
PMD path. Is there any particular concern about using PTE_SPECIAL ? Nonetheless
I will evaluate above proposal of using (0b10) to represent invalid but present
huge PMD entry during splitting.

Though this change really makes sense just from fixing generic pmdp_invalidate()
perspective as all it asks is to invalidate the PMD entry not mark them non-present
and currently calling pmd_mknotpresent() in that sense is bit misleading.

But for arm64 I believe implementing arch specific pmdp_invalidate() via subscribing
__HAVE_ARCH_PMDP_INVALIDATE is bit better. Because the implementation needs more than
just a PMD entry invalidation even with above proposed 0b10 method or with PTE_SPECIAL.
pmd_mknotvalid() should not do that additional stuff but instead a platform specific 
pmdp_invalidate() can incorporate that after doing the real invalidation i.e clearing
the bit 0 in pmd_mknotvalid().
