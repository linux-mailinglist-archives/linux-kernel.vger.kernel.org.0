Yeah, it seems the "Kernel panic - not syncing: Segfault with no mm",
"Kernel mode fault at addr...", and "Kernel tried to access user
memory at addr..." errors all come from segv() in
arch/um/kernel/trap.c due to what I think is this type of check
whether the address is
in userspace or not.

What x86 does when KASAN_VMALLOC is disabled is make all vmalloc
region accesses succeed by default
by using the early shadow memory to have completely unpoisoned and
unpoisonable read-only pages for all of vmalloc (which includes
modules). When KASAN_VMALLOC is enabled in x86, the shadow memory is not
allocated for the vmalloc region at startup. New chunks of shadow
memory are allocated and unpoisoned every time there's a vmalloc()
call. A similar thing might have to be done here by mprotect()ing
the vmalloc space as read only, unpoisoned without KASAN_VMALLOC. This
issue here is that
kasan_init runs so early in the process that the vmalloc region for
uml is not setup yet.

I have been testing this issue in a multitude of ways and have only
been getting more confused. It's still very unclear where exactly the
problem occurs, mostly because the errors I found most frequently were
reported in segv(), but the stack traces never contained segv.

Does anyone know if/how UML determines if memory being accessed is
kernel or user memory?
