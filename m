It make sense, looking forward to the inner node parallel init.

@Daniel
Is there schedule about ktasks?

Thanks!

Yes, the time spend of pages init depends on the CPU frequency,
and the jiffies update controlled by HZ, so it's hard to find a general 
constant.

It seems we need a bigger refactors about the lock to get a better solution.
