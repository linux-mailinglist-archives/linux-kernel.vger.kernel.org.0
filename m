Yes, if it has been produced by a link editors which does not about
property notes.  The ELF file still needs to be treated as valid, but
the note should be ignored.

Using an older link editor on a CET-enabled distribution will produce
such binaries, too.  The ELF file still needs to be treated as valid,
but the property date should be ignored.

Correct.  Additional processing logic in the link editor is needed.

H.J. needs to answer that.

Likewise.

We should put it into <elf.h> in glibc.  We don't want to rely on UAPI
headers there because this version of <elf.h> is used in many places.

Thanks,
