Actually, it seems still need to write if I understand correctly,

ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_BITS(page->flags, ZONES_MASK << ZONES_PGSHIFT);
return data_race((page->flags >> ZONES_PGSHIFT) & ZONES_MASK);

On the other hand, if you really worry about this thing could go wrong, it might
be better of using READ_ONCE() at the first place where it will be more future-
proof with the trade-off it might generate less efficient code optimization?

Alternatively, is there a way to write this as this?

return ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_BITS(page->flags, ZONES_MASK << ZONES_PGSHIFT);

Kind of ugly but it probably cleaner.

For example, HARMLESS_COUNTERS(), READ_SINGLE_BIT(), READ_IMMUTATABLE_BITS() etc which Linus said exactly wanted to avoid.
