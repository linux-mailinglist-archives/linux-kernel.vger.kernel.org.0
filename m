Yes, I didn't forget about this, it's just that I can't apply this to
4.14-rt until 4.19-rt does, otherwise it will be seen as a regression
to someone moving from 4.14-rt to 4.19-rt.

I will be keeping my eye out for when that happens and will apply it to
the next backport release at that point.

Thanks for making sure it wasn't missed in any case.
