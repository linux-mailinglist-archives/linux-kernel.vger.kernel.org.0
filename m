No problem.

Indeed. I was speculating earlier if the opposite could happen too. If
we extended the second case to form a repeating pattern, could we
prevent somehow prevent CPU1 from reaching a deeper state? Could we have
pattern that would keep both CPUs in shallow state where it would have
been more efficient to consolidate the wake-ups on CPU0 and let CPU1
enter deeper states?

Ideally yes. However it depends on the break-even times of the deeper
states and when the next wake-ups happen.

Moving the wake-up shouldn't impact energy directly, although it have a
positive latency impact as you are more likely to avoid waking up CPUs
that haven't finished the idle entry sequence. However, changing the
wake-up pattern could have an indirect energy impact, positive or
negative. It isn't clear to me either what outcome to expect.
