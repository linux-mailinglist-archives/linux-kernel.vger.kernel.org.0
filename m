I think this is the fallback to some older method of runtime
suspending the device, and I think it will end up touching different
registers on the bridge controller which do not show the broken
behaviour.

You'll find references to following variables which all cause a link
to be powered down: Q0L2 (newest), P0L2, P0LD (oldest, I think).

Maybe I remember incorrectly and have to read the code again... okay,
the fallback path uses P0LD indeed. That's actually the only register
of those being documented by Intel afaik.

This sounds to be very helpful, I'll give it a try.
