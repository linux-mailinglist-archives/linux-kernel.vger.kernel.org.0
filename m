I had originally suggested to just make the driver build on x86, but an
atlternative was to provide the call for the missing architecture.

Right, the goal was to not call MTRR directly.

Such things are needed, otherwise some systems may not boot...

I think this would be possible if we could flop ioremap_nocache() to UC
instead of UC- on x86. Otherwise, I can't see how we can remove this by
still not allowing direct MTRR calls.
