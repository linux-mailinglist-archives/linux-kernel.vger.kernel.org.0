And this would exactly happen as pointed out by Sergey. match() does
also some setup operations. I would be scared to call them twice.

Your solution is not acceptable because it might cause calling
match() more times.

The reverse search of list of console does not work for ttySX
consoles because the number is omitted when matching. And the messages
will appear only on the first matched serial console. There is
a paragraph about this in the commit message of my patch.

I would be fine to take my patch as is and do the clean up later.
It seems that more users are affected by the problem. The clean up
might be complicated and prone to regressions.

The question is how far back you would like to go. The changes
in register_console() are rare. Everybody is scared to touch
this mess ;-) And it is prone to regressions.

My patch is primary fixing this 2nd problem. It fixes showconsole
tool to work correctly. But it covers also the 1st one. It might
be possible to split it when needed. But I think that you could
not easily fix the 1st problem without solving the 2nd one.

The best solution would be to split the match() and setup
functionality. It would be really appreciated. But it is a lot
of work. And it might be hard to backport.

Petr
