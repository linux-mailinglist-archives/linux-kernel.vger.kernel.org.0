I can't resist: s/hz/Hz/

Nit: we're missing a comment somewhere that the unit of this is in kHz
(which explains the * 1000).

Okay so what we get in the tick is:

  /\ core
  --------
  /\ const

And we want that to be SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE when running at max freq. IOW we
want to turn

  max_freq
  ----------
  const_freq

into SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE, so we can just multiply that by:

  const_freq
  ---------- * SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE
  max_freq

But what the ratio you are storing here is 

                          const_freq
  arch_max_freq_scale =   ---------- * SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE²
                           max_freq

(because x << 2 * SCHED_CAPACITY_SHIFT == x << 20)


In topology_freq_scale_tick() you end up doing

  /\ core   arch_max_freq_scale
  ------- * --------------------
  /\ const  SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE

which gives us what we want (SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE at max freq).


Now, the reason why we multiply our ratio by the square of
SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE was not obvious to me, but you pointed me out that the
frequency of the arch timer can be *really* low compared to the max CPU freq.

For instance on h960:

  [    0.000000] arch_timer: cp15 timer(s) running at 1.92MHz (phys)

  $ root@valsch-h960:~# cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy4/cpuinfo_max_freq 
  2362000

So our ratio would be

  1'920'000 * 1024
  ----------------
    2'362'000'000

Which is ~0.83, so that becomes simply 0...


I had a brief look at the Arm ARM, for the arch timer it says it is
"typically in the range 1-50MHz", but then also gives an example with 20KHz
in a low-power mode.

If we take say 5GHz max CPU frequency, our lower bound for the arch timer
(with that SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE² trick) is about ~4.768KHz. It's not *too*
far from that 20KHz, but I'm not sure we would actually be executing stuff
in that low-power mode.

Long story short, we're probably fine, but it would nice to shove some of
the above into comments (especially the SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE² trick)
