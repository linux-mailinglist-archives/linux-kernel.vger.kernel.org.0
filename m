(Nit: stray whitespace in the fixes tag, the backport tools may choke on this)

(Please include 'PATCH' in the [] section of the subject when posting, its part of the
'canonical patch format', and my scripts for pulling a series of the list depend on it!)

Thanks for picking up my suggestion, ... it was what I think should have been done in the
first place to avoid this bug.
Looking at your patch, we'd need to take the per-event lock around the reads of reregister
and reenable in sdei_cpuhp_up() too, and sdei_reregister_shared(), ... and this quickly
becomes much noisier than a patch for stable should be. (Sorry, I should have tried it
before suggesting it!)


I've picked up your first version, but instead of duplicating the contents of the
function, I've added '_llocked' wrappers to account for that lock already being held. This
isn't great as we have _locked too, but lockdep should keep us honest.
Because I started with your patch, git has kept you as author.
This ended up as patch 2, because it was also necessary to move those reregister updates
into their callers to fix hibernate.

I'll posted what I have next week, sorry for the hiatus.


Thanks,

James
