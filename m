FYI I have seen the issue Oleksandr is talking about too. I confirm that
the only reason for the of_configure_dma call is to get away from the
dummy_dma_ops and use the default dma_ops instead. I think this should
be mentioned in the commit message so that if one day the behavior
regarding dummy_dma_ops changes one more time, hopefully we'll be able
to figure out the issue more easily with bisection.

In regards to the coherent_dma_mask and dma_mask, I can't see why gntdev
would have any dma addressing limitations, so we should be able to set
both to 64 bits.  I also can't see why xen_drm_front would limit it to
32 bits, after all this is just the frontend, if anything it would be
the backend that has a limitation. So, we should be able to set both
dma_mask and coherent_dma_mask in xen_drm_front to 64 bits. Oleksandr,
can you confirm?
