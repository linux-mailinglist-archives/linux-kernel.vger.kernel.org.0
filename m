No problem. Thanks for the questions.

Hmm... I wonder what the implications are. We've been patching in a 
'trap' for kprobes for a long time now, along with having to patch back 
the original instruction (which can be anything), when the probe is 
removed.

Good point. Per 
Documentation/RCU/Design/Requirements/Requirements.html#Tasks RCU:
"The solution, in the form of Tasks RCU, is to have implicit read-side 
critical sections that are delimited by voluntary context switches, that 
is, calls to schedule(), cond_resched(), and synchronize_rcu_tasks(). In 
addition, transitions to and from userspace execution also delimit 
tasks-RCU read-side critical sections."

I suppose transitions to/from userspace, as well as calls to schedule() 
result in context synchronizing instruction being executed. But, if some 
tasks call cond_resched() and synchronize_rcu_tasks(), we probably won't 
have a CSI executed.

Also:
"In CONFIG_PREEMPT=n kernels, trampolines cannot be preempted, so these 
APIs map to call_rcu(), synchronize_rcu(), and rcu_barrier(), 
respectively."

In this scenario as well, I think we won't have a CSI executed in case 
of cond_resched().

Should we enhance patch_instruction() to handle that?
