FWIW, I think you're being saved right now by the craziness in the crypto
subsystem Kconfig options: CONFIG_DM_CRYPT selects CONFIG_CBC, which selects
CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER, which selects CONFIG_CRYPTO_MANAGER2, which selects
CONFIG_CRYPTO_AEAD2 (and all the other algorithm types, for that matter).
This makes the AEAD API available.

If this wasn't the case, dm-crypt's use of crypto_alloc_aead() would be causing
a link error in some kernel configurations, since CONFIG_DM_CRYPT doesn't
actually select the AEAD API itself.

At some point I (or someone else up to the task) might try to fix the crypto
subsystem to not make every template select every algorithm type.  In that
happens, we'll need to update the users like dm-crypt to explicitly select the
algorithm types they're using, if they were being implicitly selected before.

In any case, allowing users to compile out the AEAD support in dm-crypt would
also be nice if it's not too difficult, since not everyone needs it.
