The same, i am on the vacation since last Thursday and the whole

Just to summarize. We would like to support head-less kvfree_rcu() interface.
It implies that we have only pure pointer that is passed and that is it. Therefore
we should maintain the dynamic arrays and place it there. Like we do for "bulk"
logic, building arrays chains. Or just attach the head for tiny version. I prefer
first variant because that is fair and will be aligned with tree RCU version.

If we can not maintain the array path, i mean under low memory condition, it makes
sense to try to attach a head(for array we allocate one page), i.e. to make an object
with rcu_head the same as ww would free regular object that contains rcu_head filed
in it: 

<snip>
static inline struct rcu_head *
attach_rcu_head_to_object(void *obj, gfp_t gfp)
{
    unsigned long *ptr;

    ptr = kmalloc(sizeof(unsigned long *) +
        sizeof(struct rcu_head), gfp);
    if (!ptr)
        return NULL;

    ptr[0] = (unsigned long) obj;
    return ((struct rcu_head *) ++ptr);
}
...
void kfree_call_rcu(struct rcu_head *head, rcu_callback_t func)
...
    if (head == NULL && is_vmalloc_addr((void *) func)) {
        if (!vfree_call_rcu_add_ptr_to_bulk(krcp, (void *) func)) {
            head = attach_rcu_head_to_object((void *) func, GFP_ATOMIC);
            if (head) {
                /* Set the offset and tag the headless object. */
                func = (rcu_callback_t) (sizeof(unsigned long *) + 1);

                head->func = func;
                head->next = krcp->head;
                krcp->head = head;
   }

later on when freeing the headless object to witch we attached the head:

for (; head; head = next) {
...
  /* We tag the headless object, so check it. */
  if (!(((unsigned long) head - offset) & BIT(0))) {
   debug_rcu_head_unqueue(head);
  } else {
   offset -= 1;
   headless_ptr = (void *) head - offset;
  }
...
if (!WARN_ON_ONCE(!__is_kfree_rcu_offset(offset))) {
   /*
    * here we kvfree() head-less object. The head was attached
    * due to low memory condition.
    */
   if (headless_ptr)
    kvfree((void *) *headless_ptr);

   kfree((void *)head - offset);
  }

It will not solve corner case. But it makes sense anyway to do because the
page allocator can say: no page, sorry, whereas slab can still serve our
request because we need only sizeof(rcu_head) + sizeof(unsigned long *)
bytes and not whole page.

Also when we detect low memory condition we should add force flag to schedule
the "monitor work" right away:

<snip>
 if (force)
     schedule_delayed_work(&krcp->monitor_work, 0);

Hmm... Please show it here, because i am a bit confused how to do that :)

can_current_synchronize_rcu()? If can we just call:

<snip>
    synchronize_rcu() or synchronize_rcu_expedited();
    kvfree();

Yes but in_atomic() does it as well, it also checks other atomic
contexts like softirq handlers and NMI ones. So calling there
synchronize_rcu() is not allowed.

Thank you, Joel :)
