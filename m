And as I mentioned, the current function might fail easily to allocate a suitable range due to the way the search works (== check aligned blocks only). The search really only provides reliable results when size==alignment and it's a power of two IMHO. Not documenting that is in my opinion misleading - somebody who wants !is_power_of2() and has no alignment requirements should probably rework the function first.

Does this add-on documentation look okay ? Should we also mention about the
possible reduction in chances of success during pfn block search for the
non-power-of-two cases as the implicit alignment will probably turn out to
be bigger than nr_pages itself ?

 * Requested nr_pages may or may not be power of two. The search for suitable
 * memory range in a zone happens in nr_pages aligned pfn blocks. But in case
 * when nr_pages is not power of two, an implicitly aligned pfn block search
 * will happen which in turn will impact allocated memory block's alignment.
 * In these cases, the size (i.e nr_pages) and the alignment of the allocated
 * memory will be different. This problem does not exist when nr_pages is power
 * of two where the size and the alignment of the allocated memory will always
 * be nr_pages.
