Hmm, then for the old driver, it should also do the most update in
non-atomic context? 

One other thing is, I profiled that updating a 3MB shadow buffer needs
20 ms, which transfer to 150 MB/s bandwidth. Could it be related with
the cache setting of DRM shadow buffer? say the orginal code use a
cachable buffer?

Thomas has suggested to disable curson by
	echo 0 > /sys/devices/virtual/graphics/fbcon/cursor_blink

We tried that way, and no change for the performance data.

Thanks,
Feng
