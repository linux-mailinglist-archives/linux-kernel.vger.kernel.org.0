Anything from Pawel. Here's the full list:

573aff747ee3 usb:cdns3 Fix for stuck packets in on-chip OUT buffer.
8bc1901ca7b0 usb:cdns3 Add Cadence USB3 DRD Driver
c2af6b07803e usb:gadget Simplify usb_decode_get_set_descriptor function.
ca888ce7495e usb:gadget Patch simplify usb_decode_set_clear_feature function.
3db1b636c07e usb:gadget Separated decoding functions from dwc3 driver.
e8a8b40cc892 dt-bindings: add binding for USBSS-DRD controller.

I just tested a branch without these patches and it builds fine:

  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/conf.o
  HOSTCC  scripts/kconfig/confdata.o
