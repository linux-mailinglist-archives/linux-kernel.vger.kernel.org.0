Heh.  0 out of 12 is small.

It actually is quite easy to do trigger the macros to generate two-reg
dcb* instructions; but all the places where that is especially useful,
in loops for example, already use hand-written assembler code (and yes,
using two-reg forms).

You probably will not want to write those routines as plain C ever
given how important those are for performance (memset, clear-a-page),
so the dcb* macros won't ever be very hot, oh well.

Thanks!
