BTW, can you repeat the timing details into the "Improve performance of
generic REFCOUNT_FULL code" patch?

Looking at timing details, the new implementation is close enough to the
x86 asm version that I would be fine to drop the x86-specific case
entirely as long as we could drop "FULL" entirely too -- we'd have _one_
refcount_t implementation: it would be both complete and fast.

However, I do think a defconfig image size comparison should be done as
part of that too. I think this implementation will be larger than the
x86 asm one (but not by any amount that I think is a problem).

I'd also note that the saturation speed is likely faster in this
implementation (i.e. the number of instructions between noticing the
wrap and setting the saturation value), as it is on the other side of
a branch instead of across a trap, trap handler lookup, and call. So
the race window should even be smaller (though I continue to think it
remains hard enough to hit as to make it a non-issue in all cases: if
you can schedule INT_MAX / 2 increments before a handful of instructions
resets it to INT_MAX / 2, I suspect there are much larger problems. :)
