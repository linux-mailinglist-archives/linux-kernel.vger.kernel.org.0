I checked with our internal team. They confirmed that there is no change 
for REF_TSC on ICL.
They will fix the comment in the next SDM update.
Thanks for bringing this up.

TOPDOWN.SLOTS(0x0400) is only available on FIXED3. It's not a generic 
event. The equivalent event for GP counters is TOPDOWN.SLOTS_P (0x01a4).
But it's not architectural event.
So I think the best way is to force TOPDOWN.SLOTS(0x0400) only in 
FIXED3. The patch as below will do so.

Subject: [PATCH] perf/x86/intel: Set correct mask for TOPDOWN.SLOTS

TOPDOWN.SLOTS(0x0400) is not a generic event. It is only available on
fixed counter3.

Don't extend its mask to generic counters.
