And this is why I'm curious as to why your workload is affected at all
because it uses many tasks.  I stopped allowing an imbalance for higher
task counts partially on the basis of your previous report.

My concern is that the shared memory options means that NUMA balancing
and false sharing can dominate and hide any impact of the patch itself.
Whether it has good or bad results may be partially down to luck.

5 should be enough for now. I'm more interested in hearing if the
regression/gain is consistent when the patch is applied and a confirmation
that the patch really makes a difference to this set of workloads.

The results of this will be interesting in itself. I'm particularly
interested in seeing what the traces look like for a good and bad result.

Ok, that is quite a problem as the assertion at the moment is that the
patch causes a mix of regressions/gains. It's currently unclear to me
why the patch would have a major impact on this workload at all given the
number of active tasks and the nature of the patch.  I'm concerned that
the workload may be naturally unstable but tracing may be able to help.
