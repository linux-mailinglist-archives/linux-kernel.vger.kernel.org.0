They will be of you commit --amend. But not without that.

People tend to typo these things quite often so I made dim extract-tags
rather liberal in what it accepts. And sometimes that means it'll pull
in all kinds of crap when people put a ':' in the wrong place. And
that's the reason I added the extra marker so it's trivial to see what
got pulled in by dim and what was there already. But it does mean you
always have to do the --amend to get rid of the markers.

I guess there are at least two options to improve the situation:
a) make dim extract-tags more strict and risk missing typoed tags
b) make dim push check that there marker has been removed from the
   commit msg
