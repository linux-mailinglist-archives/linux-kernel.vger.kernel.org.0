Yes, as you said the first register resource is enough for LGM RCU as 
registers are at one single region. Whereas in older SoCs RCU registers 
are at different regions, so for that reason reg_set2/3/4 are used.

Driver will decide in reading the no. of register resources based on the 
"struct of_device_id".
