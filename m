Same, sorry for the delay.

That all sounds reasonable for VRX200/LGM to me.

Just to be sure, you are suggesting to add support for the current
lantiq,reset binding to the reset-intel driver at a later point? I
see no reason not to do that, but I'm also not quite sure what the
benefit will be over just keeping reset-lantiq as is?

More work than what alternative?

Reset drivers are typically so simple, I'm not quite sure whether it is
worth to integrate multiple drivers if it complicates matters too much.
In this case though I expect it would just be adding support for a
custom .of_xlate and lantiq specific register property parsing?

Philipp
