I did not understand and read the MCE details, but we previously had a
MCE problem, Xunlei fixed in below commit:
commit 5bc329503e8191c91c4c40836f062ef771d8ba83

    x86/mce: Handle broadcasted MCE gracefully with kexec

I wonder if this is same issue or not. Also the old discussion is in
below thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/753530/

Tony raised similar questions, but I'm not sure if it is still a problem
or it has been fixed.
