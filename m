Fair enough, being as that is also the reason for _rcu_read_lock()
not being inlined.  :-/

Yes, understood, but this is also adding some arithmetic, a comparison,
and a conditional branch.  Are you -sure- that this is cheaper than
an unconditional call and return?

I have taken a couple of the earlier patches in the series.

Perhaps inlining these things is instead a job for the long anticipated
GCC LTO?  ;-)
