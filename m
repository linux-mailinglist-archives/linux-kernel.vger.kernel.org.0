> The 'iommus' property only applies to platform devices,

An early version of this patch series was limited to platform device,
but that's not true with the version that Will pointed to and was
merged into driver-core-next. The iommu parsing and creating device
links applies to all devices that use DT. That's why this code is in
of/property.c opposed to of/platform.c.

I looked into the iommu-map property and it shouldn't be too hard to
add support for it. Looks like we can simply hold off on probing the
root bridge device till all the iommus in its iommu-map are probed and
we should be fine.

I'd love to add ACPI support too, but I have zero knowledge of ACPI.
I'd be happy to help anyone who wants to add ACPI support that allows
ACPI to add device links.

IOMMU driver/framework or whoever else can create device links as
necessary. That's not mutually exclusive to the firmware adding device
links (the device links APIs handle this nicely). While device probe
ordering is one benefit of my patch series, that's not all of it
though. It also deals with making sure suppliers known when they can
clean up the boot state of their device even when the drivers for all
their consumers are loaded as modules (so late initcall won't work). I
can go into more details on this if needed, but that latter part is
not very relevant in this context and you can find most of the details
in my patch series/documentation I added.

Thanks,
Saravana
