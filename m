What?

    0xfffb7019 - 0xfffb6e28 = 497

What's treated negative there? And what would truncate that to 0?

A 'negative delta' value can only happen when the clocksource is not read
before it advanced more than mask/2. For jiffies this means 2^31
ticks. That would be ~248 days for HZ=100 or ~24 days for HZ=1000.

>   clocksource: 'tsc-early' cs_now: 52c3918b89d6 cs_last: 52c31d736d2e

  0x52c3918b89d6 - 0x52c31d736d2e = 1.94774e+09

Again nothing is treated negative here, but the point is that the TSC
advanced by ~2e9 cycles while jiffies advanced by 497.

How that's related, I can't tell because I don't know the TSC frequency of
your machine. HZ is probably 1000 as the watchdog period is HZ/2.

Even if the watchdog is not read out for a quite some time, the math in
there and in clocksource_delta() can handle pretty large deltas.

The watchdog triggers when

    abs(delta_watchdog - delta_tsc) > 0.0625 seconds

So that has absolutely nothing to do with CPU being busy and watchdog not
being serviced. jiffies and TSC drift apart for some reason, and that
reason wants to be documented in the changelog.

That said, I have no objections against the patch itself, but I'm not going
to apply a patch with a fairy tale changelog.

Thanks,
