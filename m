RHEL7 looks to have been released with 2.23 and we already don't
support the version in RHEL6, so that should be good too.

Thumbs up from me -- I had thought there were a few other reports
earlier about these, but looking at those threads, it seems like they're
all actually with ld.gold, which we already decided to drop support for
in commit 75959d44f9dc ("kbuild: Fail if gold linker is detected").
