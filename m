Patch changelogs are (mostly) meant for humans to read too, but we have
some standards for how we want them formatted.  I don't think the
maintainer profiles should be all that tightly specified, but it would be
a whole lot better if cross-subsystem developers knew where to look to
quickly find the information they need.  So I'd prefer it if we could find
a way to conform to a set of loose guidelines for these files.
