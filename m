so libbpf 'moved' for this reason to github repo,
but keeping the kernel as the true/first source,
and updating github repo when release is ready

libbpf github repo is then source for fedora (and others)

yep, we already have a way to link libbpf dynamicaly from package,
will work the same for libtraceevent
