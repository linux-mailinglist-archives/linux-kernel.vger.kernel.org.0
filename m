I think only the comment bit is still there in this version and it's not
really worth mentioning (but I do thank you for doing it!).

This is all on the busiest group, so this should be more like:

I'm confused now, have we set env->imbalance to anything at this point? AIUI
Vincent's suggestion was to hinge this purely on the weight vs idle_cpus /
nr_running, IOW not use imbalance:

if (sd->flags & SD_NUMA) {                                                                         
	imbalance_adj = max(2U, (busiest->group_weight *                                           
				 (env->sd->imbalance_pct - 100) / 100) >> 1);                      
	imbalance_max = (busiest->group_weight >> 1) + imbalance_adj;                              
                                                                                                     
	if (busiest->idle_cpus >= imbalance_max) {                                                 
		env->imbalance = 0;                                                                
		return;                                                                            
	}                                                                                          
}                                                                                                  
       
Now, I have to say I'm not sold on the idle_cpus thing, I'd much rather use
the number of runnable tasks. We are setting up a threshold for how far we
are willing to ignore imbalances; if we have overloaded CPUs we *really*
should try to solve this. Number of tasks is the safer option IMO: when we
do have one task per CPU, it'll be the same as if we had used idle_cpus, and
when we don't have one task per CPU we'll load-balance more often that we
would have with idle_cpus.
