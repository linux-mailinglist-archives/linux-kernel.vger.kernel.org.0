What you really needs is something like the dma_alloc_pages interface
here:

   http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/misc.git/shortlog/refs/heads/dma_alloc_pages

which has been preempted by a few other things, and the fact that
the AMD SEV encryption bit breaks various assumptions made in this
interface..
