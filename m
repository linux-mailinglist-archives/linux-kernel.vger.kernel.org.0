I provided a diff with my thoughts of how to remove this warning in
the original post :)

This comment was about your patch which, to my mind, makes the flag 
meaningless and so could just remove the whole thing. I was not 
proposing to actually do that. I assumed it was there because it was
thought to be useful. Although, if that is what people want I could 
certainly spin up a patch to that effect. 


Cheers,
Phil
