That was indeed one of the goals.  Another was to replace the incredible
pile of fragile duct tape that the docs build system had become with
something more robust, understandable, and maintainable.  We did that, to
an extent at least, and life is better.

Jani worries that we have been regressing toward duct-tape mode, and I
suspect he may be right.  I'm certainly as guilty as anybody of tossing
stuff in because it's expedient right now.  It is right to ask whether we
should continue in that direction.

Can we slow down just a bit on the ABI files?  It may be that Mauro's
solution is the best one, but I would really like to think a bit about
how all this stuff fits together, and life isn't really even giving me
time to tie my shoes these days.  I don't think that this is screamingly
urgent right now.

Thanks,

jon
