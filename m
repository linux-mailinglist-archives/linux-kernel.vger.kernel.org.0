I'm afraid this is just a way of abusing the OPP's. I actually already
had variant of the CPUFreq driver where it was managing all of the
coupled regulators and gave up on it because it's just not very
practical and adds a lot of unnecessary churning into the code. Note
that it's just the CPUFreq driver, there are quite a lot of other (CORE)
drivers as well and there are a lot of voltage combinations because OPP
entries are also specific to a range of hardware versions.

AFAIK, there is no good solution in upstream kernel for that problem
yet. Maybe it will be possible to reset hardware into a some more
predictable state early during kernel's boot for the start, will see.
