I am going to have to disagree with you on this one, unfortunately.
Using regmap API explicitly definitely makes code more verbose, less
readable or more annoying though? Not really from my perspective. With
regmap code I know what the code is doing the moment I look at it,
with the example above, not so much. I also find it annoying that I
now have to remember the tricks that tc_write is pulling internally as
well as be mindful of a global-ish error state object. My problem with
original code was that a) it traded explicitness for conciseness in a
an unfavorable way, which I still think is true for code above b) it
didn't provide a comprehensive abstraction completely removing regmap
API and still relied on things like regmap_update_bits() explicitly,
making the code even more confusing (true for above example as well).
I think this driver isn't big enough to have a dedicated person always
working on it and it will mostly see occasional commits from somewhat
random folks who are coming to the codebase fresh, so creating as
little "institutional knowledge", so to speak, in a form of a custom
exception-like mechanism and opting for explicit but verbose code
seems like a preferable choice.

Anyway, I get it that's it is a loose suggestion :-), just wanted to
provide a detailed explanation why I'd rather not go that way.

Thanks,
Andrey Smirnov
