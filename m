My main concern with v4 was the mismatch between the computed value and the goal to not overload the LLCs

If there is no good way to compute the allowed imbalance, a hard coded value of 2 is probably simple value to start with

Are you sure that it's necessary ? This degree of imbalance already applies only if the group has spare capacity

something like

+               /* Consider allowing a small imbalance between NUMA groups */
+               if (env->sd->flags & SD_NUMA) {
+
+                       /*
+                        * Until we found a good way to compute an acceptable
+						 * degree of imbalance linked to the system topology
+						 * and that will not impatc mem bandwith and latency,
+						 * let start with a fixed small value.
+						 */
+                       imbalance_adj = 2;
+
+                       /*
+                        * Ignore small imbalances when the busiest group has
+                        * low utilisation.
+                        */
+                        env->imbalance -= min(env->imbalance, imbalance_adj);
+               }
