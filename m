You can, at least until the emergency memory pools are exhausted.

How much are we really losing by having an rcu_head in the structure,
either separately or unioned over other fields?

Would you rather pay an rcu_head tax (in cases where it cannot share
with other fields), or would you rather have states where you could free
a lot of memory if only there was some memory to allocate to track the
memory to be freed?

But yes, as you suggested above, there could be an API similar to the
userspace RCU library's API that usually just queues the callback but
sometimes sleeps for a full grace period.  If enough people want this,
it should not be hard to set up.
