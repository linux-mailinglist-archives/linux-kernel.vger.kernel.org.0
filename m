Hi Tim,

You are using an ancient email address for me.

Use either shuah@kernel.org or skhan@linuxfoundation.org

You can use TEST_GEN_PROGS and define LDFLAGS for lcap

Take a look at seccomp patch I sent out. Use the approach used
in this patch.

Are you using

git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shuah/linux-kselftest.git 
kernelci branch

This is fixed and that is the very first patch I sent.

I also applied the patch to

git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shuah/linux-kselftest.git next 
branch

thanks,
