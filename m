Add an exported function named trace_synth_event(), allowing modules
or other kernel code to generate synthetic events.

Also added are several functions that allow the same functionality to
be broken out in a piecewise fashion, which are useful in situations
where generating an event from a full array of values would be
cumbersome.  Those functions are trace_synth_event_start/end() and
add_(next)_synth_val().
