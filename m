As a straw-man approach: make the rule that we never call EFI after secure l=
aunch. Instead we write out any firmware variables that we want to change on=
 disk somewhere.  When we want to commit those changes, we reboot, commit th=
e changes, and re-launch. Or we deactivate the kernel kexec-style, seal the i=
mage against PCRs, blow away PCRs, call EFI, relaunch, unseal the PCRs, and c=
ontinue on our merry way.

I=E2=80=99m not sure how SMM fits in to this whole mess.

If we insist on allowing EFI calls and SMM, then we may be able to *measure*=
 our exposure to potentially malicious firmware, but we can=E2=80=99t elimin=
ate it. I personally trust OEM firmware about as far as I can throw it.=
