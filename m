Yay (ish)!

[ and the tangential challenge would be to find out what the real global 
fault interrupt is, 'cause apparently it's not SPI 68... ]

If that stream ID were a PCI RID, it would be 01:08.0

And this guy would be 00:02.0

So it seems that either the stream ID mapping is non-trivial (and 
"mmu-masters" couldn't have worked), or there are secret magic endpoints 
writing to memory during boot. Either way it probably needs some input 
from Cavium/Marvell to get straight. In the meantime, unless just 
disabling and ignoring the SMMU altogether is a viable option, I guess 
we have to resign to this being one of those "non-good" reasons for 
needing global bypass :(

Robin.

(note to self: it would probably be useful if we dump GFAR in these logs 
too. These are all writes, so it's possible they could be MSI attempts 
targeting the ITS rather than DMA as such)
