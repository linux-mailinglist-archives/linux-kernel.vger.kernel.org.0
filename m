This is my understanding, yes. While this patch supports knowing whether
each L3 is inclusive or not, I expect this information to be the same
for all L3 instances as will be supported by a single query in
rdt_pseudo_lock_init(). This definitely is the case on the platforms we
are enabling in this round.

Some platforms being enabled in this round have SKUs with inclusive
cache and also SKUs with non-inclusive cache. The non-inclusive cache
SKUs do not support cache pseudo-locking and cannot be made to support
cache pseudo-locking with software changes. Needing to know if cache is
inclusive or not will thus remain a requirement to distinguish between
these different SKUs. Supporting cache pseudo-locking on platforms with
non inclusive cache will require new hardware features.
