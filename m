Essentially yes.  Conceptually it doesn't seem like this change should
cause any harm, however -

This sounds like we are trying to work around the clk framework, which
seems wrong.  It feels like we should be able to set a clk flag for
this and make the framework deal with it.

Also, this fix is 10nm specific, yet this issue affects all
implementations?  Seems like this should perhaps be in common code so
that we don't need to play whack-a-mole by fixing every implementation
piecemeal.

Finally, the PLLs are notorious for not taking a configuration unless
they are running.  I admit, I haven't looked at this patch in detail
to determine if that is the case here, but there doesn't seem to be
any indication from the commit test or a comment that doing so is
actually valid in all cases.
