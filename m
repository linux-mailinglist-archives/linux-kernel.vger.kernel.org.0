this limitation would be great to have in the description of patch 7
from this series

it would be great to have a better description as part of the commit
message - with that you can add my:
Acked-by: Martin Blumenstingl <martin.blumenstingl@googlemail.com>

my proposal for an update patch description (apologies I have
incorrectly summarized your findings):
"
At the moment, all our attempts to enable HS400 on Amlogic chipsets have
been unsuccessful or unreliable:
- signal resampling without delay adjustments and phase tuning for the
RX and TX clocks (this caused CRC errors and hangs even without HS400
mode, for example on the Khadas VIM, Khadas VIM2 and libretech-cc
boards)
- signal resampling without delay adjustments and RX clock phase
tuning (some HS200 and HS400 eMMC chips were not recognized, for
example on the Khadas VIM and Khadas VIM2 boards)
- signal resampling tuning with delay adjustments only (works fine for
HS200 and UHS modes but doesn't fix HS400 eMMC chips, for example on
Khadas VIM2)

Further improvements for the HS400 mode are likely to be linked to the
data strobe signal.
Until we can figure out how to enable this mode safely and reliably,
let's force it off.
"

This whole series is a good step forward.
also thank you for this additional explanation!
