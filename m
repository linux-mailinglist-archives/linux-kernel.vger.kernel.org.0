My Cubox-i4 (no issue getting an IP address and GbE) is connected to the
same switch as the Cubox-i2 (the one affected by this bug).
mii-tool output for my Cubox-i4:

Yes, it doesn't help.

I was checked-out at 5502b218e001 ("net: phy: use
phy_resolve_aneg_linkmode in genphy_read_status") so I was missing both.

With the smartspeed disabled + soft reset patch against v5.1-rc1 +
cherry-pick the missing 0672d22a1924 ("ARM: dts: imx: Fix the AR803X
phy-mode") I'm finally getting an IP address.

Note that I do need the genphy soft reset without it I don't get an IP
address.

Also tested v5.3 with the patch and it does work.

I'm adding the output for v5.3 with this patch.
