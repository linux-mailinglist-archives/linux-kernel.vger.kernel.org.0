No, with LTO you don't have that guarantee. For functions it's more obvious,
GCC wants to analyze functions in reverse topological order so callees are
generally optimized before callers, and it will emit assembly as it goes, so
function ordering with LTO does not give much care to translation unit
boundaries. For variables it's a bit more subtle, GCC partitions all variables
and functions so it can hand them off to multiple compiler processes while doing
LTO. There's no guarantees about order of variables that end up in different
partitions.

There's __attribute__((no_reorder)) that is intended to enforce ordering even
with LTO (it's documented under "Common function attributes" but works for
global variables as well).
