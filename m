Hmm.

I may read this patch wrong, but from what I can tell, if we really
have just one process with an io bitmap, we're doing unnecessary
copies.

If we really have just one process that has an iobitmap, I think we
could just keep the bitmap of that process entirely unchanged. Then,
when we switch away from it, we set the io_bitmap_base to an invalid
base outside the TSS segment, and when we switch back, we set it back
to the valid one. No actual bitmap copies at all.

So I think that rather than the "begin/end offset" games, we should
perhaps have a "what was the last process that used the IO bitmap for
this TSS" pointer (and, I think, some sequence counter, so that when
the process updates its bitmap, it invalidates that case)?

 Of course, you can do *nboth*, but if we really think that the common
case is "one special process", then I think the begin/end offset is
useless, but a "last bitmap process" would be very useful.

Am I missing something?
