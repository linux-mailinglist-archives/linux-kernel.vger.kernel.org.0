My fault, I thought people would often give comments on each patch, will care this from now on.

I have been run kernel build with a "mem=700M cgroup_disabled=memory" qemu-kvm
with a swapfile for 3 hours, Hope I could catch sth while waiting for your 
kindly reproduce scripts. Thanks Hugh!

Is there some place to get mmotm's crash backtrace?

Did you mean the Johannes's question of race on page->memcg in previous email?

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/11/22/2153

From then on, I have tired 2 solutions to protect page->memcg, 
first use lock_page_memcg(wrong) and 2nd new solution, taking PageLRU bit as page 
isoltion precondition which may work for memcg migration, and page 
migration in compaction etc. Could you like to give some comments on this?

Sorry, Hugh, I didn't know you have per memcg lru_lock patchset before I sent 
out my first verion.

Thanks advance for your coming testing scripts, I believe it will help a lot.

BTW, I try my best to orgnize this patches to make it stright, a senior experts
like you, won't cost much time to go through whole patches. and give some precious
comment! 

I am looking forward to hear comments from you. :)

Thanks
Alex
