I neither acked nor blocked the fix in the random generator. I believe
that it was false positive. But the fix was trivial and I did not have
any better solution in the pocket.

This is misleading. Using printk_deferred() in
_warn_unseeded_randomness() is whack-a-mole approach as well.

The most realistic real solution is to deffer consoles into kthreads.
It is being discussed for years. There is finally an agreement
to get this upstream. But the priority is to add lockless ringbuffer
first.

I could understand that Michal is against hack in -mm code that
would just hide a false positive warning.

If you really need a solution before the console offload gets
upstream then I suggest to do something really simple. For example,
disable lockdep around the allocation in console registration code
that is proven to produce the false positive chain.

Best Regards,
Petr
