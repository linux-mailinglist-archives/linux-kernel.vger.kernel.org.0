Subject: [patch 07/44] posix-cpu-timers: Simplify sighand locking in
 run_posix_cpu_timers()

run_posix_cpu_timers() is called from the timer interrupt. The posix timer
expiry always affects the current task which got interrupted.

sighand locking is only racy when done on a foreign task, which must use
lock_task_sighand(). But in case of run_posix_cpu_timers() that's
pointless.

sighand of a task can only be dropped or changed by the task itself. Drop
happens in do_exit(), changing sighand happens in execve().

So the timer interrupt can see one of the following states of the current
task which it interrupted:

   - executing:	sighand is set
   - exiting:	sighand is either set or NULL
   - execing:	sighand is either the original one or the new one

The 'check -> lock -> check again' logic in lock_task_sighand() is not
required here at all. The state cannot change as the interrupted task
context obviously is not executing instructions.

So the only interesting case here is to check whether current->sighand is
NULL or not.

Add the check for sighand == NULL right at the beginning and replace
lock_task_sighand() with a regular spin_lock() invocation along with proper
comments why this is safe.
