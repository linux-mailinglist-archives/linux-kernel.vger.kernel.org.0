Yeah, I think you're right, it's the exact same scenario here.

If we fail to find a big enough CPU, we'll just fallback to the rest of
select_idle_sibling() which will pick an idle CPU, just without caring
about capacity.

Now an alternative here would be to:
- return the first idle CPU on which the task fits (what the above does)
- else, return the biggest idle CPU we found (this could e.g. still steer
  the task towards a medium on a tri-capacity system)

I think what we were trying to go with here is to not entirely hijack
select_idle_sibling(). If we go with the above alternative, topologies
with sched_asym_cpucapacity enabled would only ever see
select_idle_capacity() and not the rest of select_idle_sibling(). Not sure
if it's a bad thing or not, but it's something to ponder over.
