I am not super happy but I really think that it does not make sense
to complicate the code too much because of this theoretical race.

1 billion printks in NMI is crazy. Also the race is a problem only
when we hit exactly the 2^30 message. If we hit 2^30 + 1 and more
than everything is fine again.

In the worst case, printk() will stop working. I think that there
are other situations that are much more likely when printk() will
not work (people will not see the messages).

The logical positions are assigned only when a descriptor is reserved.
Such a descriptor could not be reused until committed and marked
reusable. It limits the logical position movement to:

   max_record_size * number_of_descriptors

Printk records are limited to 1k. So we could safely support
up to 1 million fully sized lines printed when NMI interrupted
printk() on one CPU.

The most important thing is that it must not crash the system.
It would be nice if we are able to detect this situation and
do something about it. But IMHO, it is perfectly fine when
printk() would stop working in this corner case.

The only problem is that it might be hard to debug. But it
should be possible with crashdump. And I think that we will
first hit some other bugs that we do not see at the moment ;-)
