Thanks.  I'll try to take a deeper look.

Were these patches based on tip/master?  There were some minor conflicts
in arch/arm64/Kconfig and arch/arm64/kernel/Makefile.

I'm also getting a build failure on arm64:

  make[4]: *** No rule to make target '/root/linux/tools/objtool/arch/arm64/arch_special.o', needed by '/root/linux/tools/objtool/arch/arm64/objtool-in.o'.  Stop

It looks like arch/arm64/Build and arch/x86/Build are trying to build
from arch_special.c which doesn't exist.
