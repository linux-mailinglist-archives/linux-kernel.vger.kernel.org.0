in the existing driver (the one on upstream atm), you have:

static struct platform_driver sdw_intel_drv = {
        .probe = intel_probe,
        .remove = intel_remove,
        .driver = {
                .name = "int-sdw",

        },
};

This is the DAI driver which registers the DAIs and and you pass on this
device, so for platform driver and above it should just work. That is
why my recommendation is to continue with this.

Again, you can add this to platform_driver sdw_intel_drv.

What I meant is that keep the existing platform device for "int-sdw".

And

a master device for everyone across x86/arm/etc spectrum would be
PCI/ACPI/OF/Platform and we should be agnostic and let these drivers add
a bus and register that

Is soundwire subsystem creating platform devices, answer is no.

The problem is we were using the master device (platform/of/pci/etc) for
our own sysfs attributes, which was a mistake and I want to rectify
that.

The device behind the soundwire controller can be anything. If hardware
creates a device for soundwire we should continue using that

Sorry to confuse you, I guess somewhere I missed to communicate that
1. keep existing platform device for master (that solves your pm and
asoc issue)
2. add a sdw_master device, but we dont need driver, use that device for
sdw sysfs attributes
3. If possible, have one api, rather than 2 for bus and master device
creation.

For your case, yes. For QC case it will be of device

> b) if No for a) then
> b.1) is the master device created within sdw_add_bus_master()

If possible that would be great. All I am trying here is to avoid having
two APIs for registration and use a single APIs for drivers to call.

> b.2) is the master device created before calling sdw_add_bus_master()

IIUC, it should be called after, right?

Let me know if this helped.
