Did I say we did? I only wrote that the problem was found this way. It's there

That would be nice from a dev standpoint if we can get a complete state for all
planes at once from DRM core, but how? DRM helper gives callbacks
for updating individual planes with prev and new state. These individual layer
change notifications don't map nicely to how pipes are represented in the mixer
registers.

Maybe reset should also reset registers?
