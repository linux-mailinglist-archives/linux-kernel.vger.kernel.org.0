I would say it is somewhat similar to the USB port power control which
eventually calls into usb_acpi_set_power_state() but in this case it only
affects the behavior when the system is NOT running.

This design has a standalone USB charge power controller on the board
that passes through the USB2 D+/D- pins from one port and is able to do
BC1.2 negotiation when the host controller is not powered, assuming
the chip has been enabled by the Embedded Controller.

We could add a Device Property to the affected USB port in ACPI and
describe it that way, similar to other properties like 'vcc-supply', 'clocks',
'vbus-detect', etc and hook it into the phy-generic driver.

However I'm not clear on whether the phy driver binding works with XHCI
when using ACPI, so this may not be an appropriate place either.
