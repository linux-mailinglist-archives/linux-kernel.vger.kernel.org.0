The above isn't related to my problem really.

It just that there may be three fields that can indicate
the node id of a cpu:
per_cpu(numa_node), cpu->node_id and cpu->dev.numa_node

The per_cpu(numa_node) may be used for the fast path, and
cpu->node_id does not seems to be used, so it can be removed
when cpu->dev.numa_node is there.

Anyway, this is different problem here, maybe a separate patch
to "fix" it or clean it up if the above makes sense to you.

Sorry for the confusion.

Yes
