I like having the possibility of using multiple irq lines for a single
virtio-mmio, but I think having to specify an irq range for each device
is a bit inconvenient.

Usually, you want an irq line per each virtqueue. So, ideally, irq
assignment should be somehow linked to the virtqueue initialization. But
this isn't PCI, so the Guest can't simply request some MSI/MSI-X
vectors and tell the device about them, as virtio-pci does.

I think an option could be extending the specification with a new
QueueVector read-only register, which would return either the irq line
to be used for the virtqueue selected by QueueSel, or a value indicating
there isn't a dedicated line for this particular virtqueue.

This way, hypervisors could lazily allocate irq lines on demand when
the QueueVector is read for the first time (or after a reset), and
users (and fdt's) would still only need to specify a single interrupt
for each virtio-mmio definition.
