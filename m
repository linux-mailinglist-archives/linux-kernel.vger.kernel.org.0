Ok, sorry I didn't see this earlier, not only was I still dropped from
the To list, but the copy I got from dri-devel ended up marked as
spam.

So this would be a concern with ION as well, since it does the same
thing because being able to allocate from multiple CMA heaps for
device specific purpose is really useful.
And at least with dmabuf heaps each heap can be given its own
permissions so there's less likelihood for any abuse as you describe.

And it also allows various device cma nodes to still be allocated from
using the same interface (rather then having to use a custom driver
ioctl for each device).

But if the objection stands, do you have a proposal for an alternative
way to enumerate a subset of CMA heaps?

thanks
