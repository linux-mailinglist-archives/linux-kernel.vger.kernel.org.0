Indeed, there are too many board setting fdt_high by default to
0xffffffff which disables device tree relocation... Not sure why vendors
are doing this, maybe because they want to save the extra copy. Often
the very same boards have a kernel load address which conflicts with the
TEXT_OFFSET address requiring the kernel to relocate before decompress,
which certainly takes longer then relocating a device tree...

Disabling relocation is also problematic when storing device tree close
by to a initrd. I remember I had an issue when using FIT images without
relocation:
https://lists.denx.de/pipermail/u-boot/2016-August/263689.html

From what I remember I tracked down the exact issue. It was due to the
fact that Linux is freeing (and poisoning) the memory of the initrd page
aligned. This then corrupted the device tree.
