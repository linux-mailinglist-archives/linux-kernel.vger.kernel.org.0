Yup, you're right, I've missed the fact that write lock is needed there.
Re-vamping locking there is not my intention, so lets find another
solution.

OK, I agree, this is a good argument to move decision to userspace.

Immediate question: what should be actually done on this? I see 2
options:

1) mark all VMAs as mergeable + set some flag for mmap() to mark all
further allocations as mergeable as well;
2) just mark all the VMAs as mergeable; userspace can call this
periodically to mark new VMAs.

My prediction is that 2) is less destructive, and the decision is
preserved predominantly to userspace, thus it would be a desired option.

Okay.

This way we lose some flexibility, IMO, but I get you point.

Thanks.
