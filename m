In *theory* one would detach before doing further CPU access to
buffer, and then re-attach when passing back to GPU.

Ofc that isn't how actual drivers do things.  But maybe it is enough
for vgem to serve it's purpose (ie. test code).

yup, it is vgem that is fundamentally broken (or maybe more
specifically doesn't fit in w/ dma-mappings view of how to do cache
maint), and I'm just papering over it because people and CI systems
want to be able to use it to do some dma-buf tests ;-)

I'm kinda wondering, at least for arm/dt based systems, if there is a
way (other than in early boot) that we can inject a vgem device node
into the dtb.  That isn't a thing drivers should normally do, but (if
possible) since vgem is really just test infrastructure, it could be a
way to make dma-mapping happily think vgem is a real device.
