It provides you with an unambiguous way of finding the correct trim
file.

The problem with trying to lower the level of the link is that all the
devices below the one I linked to are transport class devices meaning
they're not visible at the point the link needs to be created.  That's
not to say some additional transport class magic couldn't be done, but
it would require pretty extensive code changes in drivers/base because
none of the current constructor functions carries additional
information, which is necessary to carry the link.
