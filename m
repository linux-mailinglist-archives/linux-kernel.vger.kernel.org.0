Sure, but this device-foo-4000 naming is a concern for standardization, 
stable ABI, and perf tool support.

But where does the PMU driver get the SoC ID? Does it have to check DT 
machine ID, ACPI OEM ID, or SMCCC SOC ID?

I can't imagine that you really want this stuff in the kernel PMU 
drivers, but that's your call.

Fine, but it's the ACPI case which is what I am concerned about.

Perf tool PMU events can handle that. Each PMCG PMU instance has a 
different name - the name encoding includes the HW base address, so 
always unique per system - and then so the JSON can know this and have 
events specific per instance.

I appreciate what you're saying. I'll check this idea further.

Cheers,
