Could you open up a bit more how this happens, mainly codepaths how the
USB3 port ends up in eSS.Disabled state

There might be something else wrong here.
My impression is that port should only end up in eSS.Disabled when directed
to with a Set_Port_Feature(PORT_LINK_STATE, eSS.Disabled) Request.
After this we shouldn't attempt warm resets, they won't work for USB3 ports in
ss.Disabled state.
