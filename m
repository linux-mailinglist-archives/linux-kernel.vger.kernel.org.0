Umm...  OK, but I wonder if unsafe_... makes the right naming conventions
for such cases.  Note that towards the end of that series we get

#define unsafe_put_sigcontext(sc, fpstate, regs, set, label)    \
do {                                                            \
        if (setup_sigcontext(sc, fpstate, regs, set->sig[0]))   \
                goto label;                                     \
} while(0);

and that's not an uncommon pattern.  We generally have unsafe_...
mean "doesn't return anything, takes a label, needs to be called
from under user_access_begin" and I suspect that it would make sense
to have another recognizable naming pattern for "it must be called
from under user_access_begin() and you need to look at return value".

In this case we could grit teeth and turn that sucker into a macro.
But what about e.g. lifting user_access_{begin,end}() out of
raw_copy_from_user()?  unsafe_copy_from_user() would imply
"all or nothing" kind of calling conventions, like e.g.
unsafe_copy_to_user() currently does.  Which is fine in some
situations, and it's a good helper to have, but we definitely
want a "how much is left to copy" variant as well.

Hmm...  raw_setup_sigcontext(), perhaps, along with the
macro above for unsafe_put_sigcontext()?
