I'd agree.

Even though this is an ITS limitation, the same thing is effectively 
done for x86 APIC as policy, right? I'm referring to commit fdba46ffb4c2 
("x86/apic: Get rid of multi CPU affinity")

Right

  Probably because the other CPU(s)

I will look to get some figures for CPU loading to back this up.

That sounds reasonable. So would the idea be to enable this optionally 
at the request threaded irq call?
