I agree with you in principle.  The problem, of course, is that this is a
legacy gift from before the RST days and it will be hard to change.

A quick grep shows that the pattern:

	* Example:

appears nearly 100 times in current kernels.  It is not inconceivable to
make a push to get rid of all of those, turning them into ordinary RST
syntax - especially since not all of those are actually kerneldoc
comments.

The same quick grep says that "returns?:" appears about 10,000 times.
*That* will be painful to change, and I can only imagine that some
resistance would have to be overcome at some point.

So what do folks think we should do? :)

I want to ponder on this for a bit.  Peter, that may mean that I hold this
patch past the 5.7 merge window, which perhaps makes sense at this point
anyway, sorry.  But I really would like to push things into a direction
that moves us away from gnarly perl hacks and toward something more
maintainable in the long term.

Thanks,

jon
