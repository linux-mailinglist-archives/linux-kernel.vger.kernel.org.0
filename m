FYI, there is a patch out there that allocates the powerpc swiotlb
from the boottom of the memblock area instead of the top to fix a 85xx
regression.

Also the AMD folks have been asking about non-GFP_DMA32 swiotlb pools
as they have the same bounce buffer issue with SEV.  I think it is
entirely doable to have multiple swiotlb pool, I just need a volunteer
to implement that.

Or switch to the generic version of __phys_to_dma that has a negative
offset.  We'd just need to look into a signed value for dma_pfn_offset
to allow for the existing platforms that need the current positive
offset.
