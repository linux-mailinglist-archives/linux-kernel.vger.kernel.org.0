Yeah, I guess so.

It is just that I thought that we might benefit from not doing extra
work if not needed (bitmap dance) in SPARSEMEM case.
But given that 1) hot-add/hot-remove paths are not hot paths, it does
not really matter 2) and that having all cases unified in one function
make sense too, spreading the work in more functions might be sub-
optimal.
I guess I could justfiy it in case both activate/deactive functions
would look convulated, but it is not the case here.

I just took another look to check that I did not miss anything.
It looks quite nice and compact IMO:
