I can reword to:

Some implementors of PSCI may wish to generally use a different reset type
than SYSTEM_WARM_RESET. For instance, Qualcomm SoCs support an alternate
reset_type which may be used in more warm reboot scenarios than
SYSTEM_WARM_RESET permits (e.g. to reboot into recovery mode).

In Qualcomm use cases, we do not always want to preserve memory to caller's
(i.e. Linux) exception level. For instance, crash recovery mode runs in
higher exception level and would not continue booting into Linux except
through a hard reset. Also, this early firmware doesn't have the ability to
understand device tree or ACPI tables to know what memory to preserve.

Per discussion with Sudeep and Charles, this use case violates PSCI
specification for SYSTEM_WARM_RESET reset type, but would be appropriate
for a vendor-specific reset type. Thus, Qualcomm firmware supports a
vendor-specific reset type which does not have the requirement to preserve
memory to caller's EL or to describe what memory is to be preserved in DT
or ACPI. If this vendor-specific reset type is used, then firmware checks
various registers (e.g. download mode [1]) to alter the restart flow (e.g.
to enter recovery mode). If no alternate flow is requested, then firmware
would boot back into Linux, preserving memory.
