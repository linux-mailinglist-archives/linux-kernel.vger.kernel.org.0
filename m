I just tested it with the lima driver (by undervolting the GPU by
0.05V) and it seems that dev_pm_opp_set_regulators is really needed.
I'll fix this in the next version of this patch and also submit a fix
for panfrost (I won't be able to test that though, so help is
appreciated in terms of testing :))
