It's not bound to the lruvec, though.  Call chain A uses it and call chain
B doesn't.  If it was always used by every call chain, I'd see your point,
but we have call chains which don't use it, and so it adds complexity.

Even though it's static, there may be other callers within the same file.
Or somebody may decide to make it non-static in the future.  I think it's
actually clearer to keep the irqflags as a separate parameter.

I don't understand how lock_page_lruvec makes this guarantee.  I'll look
at the code again and see if I can understand that.
