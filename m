So, no open code is talking to this one specific driver?  And you have
run this past your lawyers?  Please go talk to them about this and see
what they say (hint, creating a custom ioctl that only you use is a
"fun" legal area...)

I have no idea what that actually means.

What is "Forward Error Correction"?  What does it do?  Is this a network
device?  Video device?  Random black box that sends radio waves?

Is there no other in-kernel driver that does much the same type of
thing?  What "class" of driver would this be?

I still don't understand what this means.

Nor do I understand what this is either.  Do you have a pointer to this
hardware somewhere online that might describe it better?  Given that I
have no clue, odds are others do not know what it is either.

What exactly are these use cases?

Where is the application?  Who runs it?  Is it already in a distro
somewhere?  Who is going to distribute it?  Who is going to support it?
Is it only for sale?  What is the license of it?
