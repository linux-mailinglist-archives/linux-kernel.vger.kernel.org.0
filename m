No problem! I guessed so :)

Yes, that's my thought too. I profiled the working set size, for most of
the drm_fb_helper_dirty_blit_real(), it will update a buffer 4096x768(3 MB),
and as it is called 30~40 times per second, it surely will affect the cache.

Do we have other options here?

My thought is this is clearly a regression, that the old driver works
fine, while the new version in linux-next doesn't. Also for a frame
buffer console, writting dozens line of message to it is not a rare
user case. We have many test platforms (servers/desktops/laptops)
with different kinds of GFX hardwares, and this model works fine for
many years :)

Thanks,
Feng
