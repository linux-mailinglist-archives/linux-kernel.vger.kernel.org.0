OK. Is this the most common configuration in the embedded ARM64
devices currently deployed: phones, cameras, consoles, players, etc?

My impression was that without PCIe GICv3 is rarely used, and this
could be the reason why this problem is not seen outside of larger
machines which normally have EFI enabled.

Thanks, this makes sense that the Linux boot time won't be affected. I
have not tested how u-boot was affected, but was told 0.5 second
longer to start.

I am not sure this analogy is correct, I do not think that non-EFI
enabled kernels became legacy.

This is exactly the problem: by having this region defined in signed
DTB file we reduce the amount of communication between the kernels.
Passing modified EFI Table causes us to pass more information from the
first kernel indefinitely through updates. Thus, increases a chance
for a security compromise. We are not changing EFI ABI between
kernels, it will stay as is. All this code does is enables kernels
that do not have EFI table communication between them a way to do
kexec updates with reduced amount of data exchange.

Thank you,
