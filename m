I guess that depends on why WQ_FREEZABLE was added to it in the first place. :-)

The reason might be to avoid writes to persistent storage after creating an
image during hibernation, since wqs remain frozen throughout the entire
hibernation including the image saving phase.

Arguably, making the wq freezable is kind of a sledgehammer approach to that
particular issue, but in principle it may prevent data corruption from
occurring, so be careful there.
