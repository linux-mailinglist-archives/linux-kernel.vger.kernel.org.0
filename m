So we end up with an additional __iormb() after each readl_relaxed call.
So except for a small speed-penalty per iteration is there some other
memory-barrier wirednes that could come into play? (Somehow I always
forget the contents of Will's memory-barrier talks after a time)


From a bit of non-scientific testing, rk3328 seems to need at max 20
iterations in the wait_lock loop for the pll to lock, when doing cpufreq
scaling.

While interestingly px30 takes somewhere between 900 and 2000 iterations
on the same pll type.
[Though sleeps are not really possible anyway due to pll rates also getting
set during of_clk_register early during boot which results in errors about
scheduling the idle thread, so in the end it doesn't really matter]
