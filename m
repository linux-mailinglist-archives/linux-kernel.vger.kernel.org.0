If by IPI-to-self you mean the IRQ work trick, that isn't implemented
across all architectures yet, is it?

I don't claim to yet fully understand what Sebastian was seeing, though
I am obviously hoping that my local experiments showing it to be fixed
in current -rcu hold true.

Why not simply make rcutorture check whether it is running in a
PREEMPT_RT_FULL environment and avoid the PREEMPT_RT_FULL-unfriendly
testing only in that case?  This could be done compatibly with mainline by
adding another rcutorture module parameter that suppressed the problematic
testing, disabled by default.  Such a patch could be accepted into
mainline, and then -rt could have a very small patch that changed the
default to enabled for CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_FULL=y kernels.

And should we later get to a place where the PREEMPT_RT_FULL-unfriendly
scenarios are prohibited across all kernel configurations, then the module
parameter can be removed.  Again, until we know (as opposed to suspect)
that these scenarios really don't happen, mainline rcutorture must
continue testing them.

							Thanx, Paul
