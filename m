I didn't convert other HW drivers on purpose since it's really up to
the platform to decide. I have tested with all drivers converted to
core_initcall and didn't find any boot issues on kernelci.

That is indeed the case - 30-40 degree rise in under 50ms can be seen
on some of these platforms.

Is it stupid if the SoC was being used in automotive with a 2s (or
less) startup requirement? :-)

I'm traveling for Connect this week but will try to post some logs
with initcall_debug turned on where changing these initcalls shaves
off several seconds. Just to reassure everyone that GKI isn't
forgotten, the next set of patches will actually add module support
for the tsens driver so AOSP can make them modules and things will
still work.

Amit
