Correct, my proposal will skip loading the MCU firmware only when
Linux boots and MCU probed.  I thought this was what your patchset is
doing.

> pretty strange for me.

After sending my email I thought about spinning off a new function,
something like rproc_sync() and call it instead of rproc_boot().  But
none of that matters now that Peng has highlighted the need to handle
late attach scenarios where the FW is never loaded by the remoteproc
core.

A very good question, and something I need to think about after
reviewing Peng's patchset.  I will get back to you.

I was talking about the lines I wrote.

Arrgghh... That's a brain bug on my side.  It should have been AP, not MCU.
