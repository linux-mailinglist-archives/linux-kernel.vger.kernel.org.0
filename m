Sorry, the grub part, I just found this entry. I need to check this
can work on x86 too.

https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/devicetree.html

Anyway, I've tested this series on qemu-x86 with --dtb option.
The kernel boot with ACPI and DT (hardware drivers seem initialized
by ACPI), and it seems unflatten the dtb correctly.

I don't want it making this for all architectures but an option for
architecutres which supports DT already...
