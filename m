Hmm, the check for num_online_cpus() is there to avoid deadlock
caused be double unlock. The unconditional init would bring it back.

It is about what compromise we use. We either try to get the messages
out, init the lock and risk a deadlock. Or we do not risk the
deadlock.

The current code is not consistent. printk_safe_flush_on_panic()
is conservative and does not risk the deadlock. While kmsg_dump(),
console_unblank() and console_flush_on_panic() risk the deadlock.

The 1st patch tries to make it more consistent. It makes all
the above functions as conservative as printk_safe_flush_on_panic()
regarding logbuf_lock. While they still risk a deadlock with
console-specific locks.

The reasoning might be:

  + The code under logbuf_lock mostly just manipulates strings. There
    are no nested locks. Infinite loops would most likely happen also
    during normal operation. By other words, it is not easy to stay
    locked in logbuf_lock (he, he, the last famous words).

  + On the other hand, a lot of code is done with disabled interrupts.
    It is easier to imagine that a CPU could not get stopped by normal
    interrupt because some deadlock or infinite loop in interrupt
    context. It might even be a code calling console_unlock().
    Re-initializing logbuf_lock might be unnecessary risk.

  + We are probably more relaxed with console specific locks because
    most of them are ignored in panic after bust_spinlocks().


Anyway, this patchset is primary about logbuf_lock related deadlocks.
I needed a fix for our customers. I do not want to spend too much
time on upstreaming. IMHO, it is better to invest into the lockless
ring buffer.

If we could agree that the patches makes things better (more
consistent, more safe in kdump with enabled notifiers) and
the complexity is acceptable. Then let's accept them
(with some trivial improvements).

If they are too controversial, risky, or complex then
let's abandon them and concentrate on lockless ring buffer.

Best Regards,
Petr
