Ah, fair point - I was imagining the glue layer's heavy-handed "turn 
everything on" approach potentially interfering with the core layer's 
ability to exert finer-grained control of the clocks it knows more 
about, but the "old kernel, new DT" situation might indeed be a problem. 
I guess that's Heiko's call in the end. Plus I'm no CCF expert so my 
concern might be unfounded anyway.

More that the 3399 board got put away in a freak "tidying the kitchen" 
incident, and I've just had too many other things on the go since :)
