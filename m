This is not to be confused with actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average latency for this queue is actually not useful for deconstruction intermediate write latencies.  So, we provide filtering based on if the request has posted or not.  By using the 'not posted' filter, we can track how long writes spent in the iMC before completions were sent to the HA.  The 'posted' filter, on the other hand, provides information about how much queueing is actually happenning in the iMC for writes before they are actually issued to memory.  High average occupancies will generally coincide with high write major mode counts. Is there a filter of sorts???",
