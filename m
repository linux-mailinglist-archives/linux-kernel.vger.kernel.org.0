Hmm, clearly we are not looking at the same datasheet, because in the one I have
I don't see any reference to T15/T16 or LCDVDD. And, I assume I am probably
wrong because you might have better access to the specific panel specs for minnie.

I looked at my archive and the datasheet I have is similar to this [1]. In page
21, Section 6.5 Power ON/OFF Sequence, there are two delays T3 and T4, it is
*min* time between the pwm signal and the bl_en and it is 200 ms. That's the
delay the patch was adding.

IIRC, It was tested measuring the backlight power on timing (although I am not
sure if I tested this on minnie or another board with better access to the pins)

Probably will not break anything, I don't remember the reverted patch as a fix
of any specific issue. IIRC it was more a fear to be out of specs but I'll not
be surprised if the datasheet lies and this delay is not needed at all.

Matthias, are you reverting this to solve any problem? Could you share your
datasheet?

Thanks,
