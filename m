Thanks for your reply.

Easy to replicate, e.g. with a vanilla v5.4 on x86_64
make x86_64_defconfig
echo CONFIG_PREEMPTIRQ_EVENTS=y >> .config
make oldconfig; make

At login:
trace-cmd record -e preemptirq:irq_enable sleep 1
trace-cmd report trace.dat | head
and I incorrectly get only the offsets to _stext:
cpus=1
           sleep-197   [000]   280.378022: irq_enable:           caller=0x1afaS parent=0xc00091S
           sleep-197   [000]   280.378026: irq_enable:           caller=0x54d34S parent=0x78e00000S
           sleep-197   [000]   280.378029: irq_enable:           caller=0x1afaS parent=0xc00a84S
           sleep-197   [000]   280.378032: irq_enable:           caller=0x263dS parent=0x78e00000S
...

With this patch I get the expected/right result:
cpus=1
           sleep-210   [000]   525.177583: irq_enable:           caller=trace_hardirqs_on_thunk parent=entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe
           sleep-210   [000]   525.177587: irq_enable:           caller=__do_page_fault parent=(nil)S
           sleep-210   [000]   525.177590: irq_enable:           caller=trace_hardirqs_on_thunk parent=swapgs_restore_regs_and_return_to_usermode
           sleep-210   [000]   525.177593: irq_enable:           caller=do_syscall_64 parent=(nil)S
...

The same correct result can be obtained by hardcoding _stext in TP_printk() (of course, disabling KASLR to use fixed _stext), e.g. on x86_64:
        TP_printk("caller=%pS parent=%pS",
-                 (void *)((unsigned long)(_stext) + __entry->caller_offs),
-                 (void *)((unsigned long)(_stext) + __entry->parent_offs))
+                 (void *)(0xffffffff81000000UL + __entry->caller_offs),
+                 (void *)(0xffffffff81000000UL + __entry->parent_offs))
 );

The problem is caused by having the macros TP_fast_assign() and TP_printk() expanded in different way.
The simpler expansion of the former macro resolves correctly the symbol _stext.
The more complex expansion of the latter macro passes through some stringification that at the end incorrectly expands _stext as 0.
At first I thought to fix the macro expansion of TP_printk(), but then I realized that:
- on 32 bit systems there is no gain in coding 32 bit offset instead of 32 bit pointer
- on 64 bit systems I cannot find a constraint that guarantees that modules are loaded within 32 bit offset from _stext
then, this patch!

Of course, on arm 32 bit using a signed offset would solve the 32 bit wraparound.

Sure, the pressure on the trace buffer will increase on a 64 bit system, but in general it also has more memory than an embedded 32 bit system.
The key point is, instead, can we feel safe with a 32 bit offset in a 64 bit system? Is there any guarantee a module is loaded within 32 bits offset from _stext?
