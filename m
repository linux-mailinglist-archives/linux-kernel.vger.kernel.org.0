Subject: [RFC 00/17] Restructure, improve target support for qcom_scm driver
Date:   Tue, 29 Oct 2019 12:40:48 -0700

This series improves support for 32-bit Qualcomm targets on qcom_scm driver.

Currently, the qcom_scm driver supports only 64-bit Qualcomm targets and very
old 32-bit Qualcomm targets. Newer 32-bit targets use ARM's SMC Calling
Convention to communicate with secure world. Older 32-bit targets use a
"buffer-based" legacy approach for communicating with secure world (as
implemented in qcom_scm-32.c). All arm64 Qualcomm targets use ARM SMCCC.
Currently, SMCCC-based communication is enabled only on ARM64 config and
buffer-based communication only on ARM config. This patch-series combines SMCCC
and legacy conventions and selects the correct convention by querying the secure
world [1].

We decided to take the opportunity as well to clean up the driver rather than
try to patch together qcom_scm-32 and qcom_scm-64.

Patches 1-4 improve macro names, reorder macros/functions, and prune unused
            macros/functions. No functional changes were introduced.
Patches 5-9 clears up the SCM abstraction in qcom_scm-64.
Patches 10-14 clears up the SCM abstraction in qcom_scm-32.
Patches 9 and 15-16 enable dynamically using the different calling conventions.

This series is based on https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/cover/1129991/
