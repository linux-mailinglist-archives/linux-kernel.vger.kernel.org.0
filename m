Not necessarily, for instance wakeup balancing (select_idle_sibling()) could
end up packing stuff within a node if said node spans more than one LLC
domain, which IIRC is the case on some AMD chips.

Or, still with the same LLC < node topology, you could start with the node
being completely utilized, then some tasks on some LLC domains terminate but
there's an LLC that still has a bunch of tasks running, and then you're left
with an imbalance between LLC domains that the wakeup balance cannot solve.

Let me spin it this way: do we need to push this ignoring of the imbalance
as far as possible, or are we okay with it only happening when there's just a
few tasks running? The latter is achieved with sum_nr_running and is the
safer option IMO.
