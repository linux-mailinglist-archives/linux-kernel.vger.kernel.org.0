Glad (or sad?) to hear we're not the only ones hitting this.

Yeah, that's also troublesome. This is by no means the first problem
related to the environment at configuration time, but it the most
bothersome to work around (at least for Fedora kernel configuration).

I agree that the issue is mixing kernel configuration with build
environment. I suppose a cache file would work, but it still sounds like
a difficult process that is working around that fact that folks are
coupling the configuration step with the build step.

I would advocate that this patch be reverted and an effort made to not
mix build environment checks into the configuration. I'm much happier
for the build to fail because the configuration can't be satisfied by
the environment than I am for the configuration to quietly change or for
the tools to not allow me to make the configuration in the first place.
Ideally the tools would warn the user if their environment won't build
the configuration, but that's a nice-to-have.
