So the question go backs to, whether this is guaranteed somehow?  Or
do you prefer us to keep the warn_on_once until it triggers then we
can analyze (which I doubt..)?

One thing to mention is that for with-vcpu cases, we probably can even
stop KVM_RUN immediately as long as either the per-vm or per-vcpu ring
reaches the softlimit, then for vcpu case it should be easier to
guarantee that.  What I want to know is the rest of cases like ioctls
or even something not from the userspace (which I think I should read
more later..).

If the answer is yes, I'd be more than glad to drop the waitqueue.

If we're still with the rule in userspace that we first do RESET then
collect and send the pages (just like what we've discussed before),
then IMHO it's fine to have vcpu2 to skip the slow path?  Because
RESET happens at "treat page as not dirty", then if we are sure that
we only collect and send pages after that point, then the latest
"write to page" data from vcpu2 won't be lost even if vcpu2 is not
blocked by vcpu1's ring full?

Maybe we can also consider to let mark_page_dirty_in_slot() return a
value, then the upper layer could have a chance to skip the spte
update if mark_page_dirty_in_slot() fails to mark the dirty bit, so it
can return directly with RET_PF_RETRY.

Thanks,
