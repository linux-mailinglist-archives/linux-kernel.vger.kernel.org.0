The bootloader should have communicated this information via the
'simple-framebuffer' binding. The problem is I think we don't have any
mechanism to ensure the simple-fb driver probes before other drivers
(other than it's dependencies). Well, there are initcall levels, but
I'd really like to get rid of any reliance on that. Anything that
relies on initcall level ordering is not going to work as module
unless userspace also ensures the ordering.

The other case I've heard of is the serial port's clock getting
disabled and killing the earlycon as we assume the bootloader left
serial port dependencies configured.

I think the ordering issue is orthogonal to using modules. We need
some way to prioritize probing of some devices. IMO, just prioritizing
the 'stdout-path' device and 'simple-framebuffer' if present solves
this. I don't think we need a general solution in this case. The may
be a few other cases, but I think these are the exception. The state
from the bootloader (and don't forget about kexec) needs to be well
defined and minimal.
