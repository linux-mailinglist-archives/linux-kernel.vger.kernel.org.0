Oh, I mis-understood this a bit and worded that incorrectly. The intent
is to avoid having to call nvme_passthru_end() in the completion handler
which can be in interrupt context.

Ok, that seems sensible. Except it conflicts a bit with Sagi's feedback:
presumably we need to cancel the work items during nvme_stop_ctrl() and
that's going to be rather difficult to do from the caller. Are we saying
this is unnecessary? It's not clear to me if passthru_start/end is going
to be affected by nvme_stop_ctrl() which I believe is the main concern.
