Stick 10 cycle events after the fixed2 flexible event. Without Song's
patch you'll never see those 10 cycle events get scheduled.

Then how was it acceptible to mux in the first place? And if
multiplexing wasn't acceptible, then why were you doing it?

That's fine; all I'm arguing is that the current behaviour doesn't
violate the guarantees given. Now you want to improve counter
utilization (at a cost) and that is fine. Just don't argue that there's
something broken -- there is not.

Your patch also does not fix something more fundamental than Song's
patch did. Quite the reverse. Yours is purely a utilization efficiency
thing, while Song's addressed a correctness issue.

I'm not arguing that. All I'm saying is that fairness is not affected.

Yes, we let it lapse and disable itself, I don't see the problem with
that -- also remember that the timer services two contexts.

If the counters were removed later (like a us before their slice
expired) there would not have been much idle time.

Either way, fairness does not mandate we schedule immediately.

Sure, but it's still non-zero :-)

I never said they were. And I'm not opposed to your patch. What I
objected to was the mischaracterization of it in the Changelog.

Present it as an optimization and all should be well.
