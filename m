I'm w/ jhugo on this one.. if you are working w/ a device that can be
programmed via i2c or dsi, regmap and limiting yourself to the small
subset of dsi cmds which map to i2c reads/writes, makes a ton of
sense.  (And I'm almost certain this bridge isn't the only such
device.)

That isn't to say you should use regmap for devices that are only
programmed over dsi.  That would be silly.  The original argument
about this not being usable by most DSI devices is really a
non-sequitur.
