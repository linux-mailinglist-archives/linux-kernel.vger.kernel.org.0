I don't think so. Does userspace hack introduce some overhead? It does not
look so. Why should we think about mergeable VMAs in page fault handler?!
This is the last thing we want to think in page fault handler.

Also, there is difficult synchronization in page fault handlers, and it's
easy to make a mistake. So, there is a mistake in [3/4], and you call
ksm_enter() with mmap_sem read locked, while normal way is to call it
with write lock (see madvise_need_mmap_write()).

So, let's don't touch this path. Small optimization for unlikely case will
introduce problems in optimization for likely case in the future.

This all requires attentive analysis. The number looks pretty big for me.
What are the pages you get merged there? This may be just zero pages,
you have identical.

E.g., your browser want to work fast. It introduces smart schemes,
and preallocates many pages in background (mmap + write 1 byte to a page),
so in further it save some time (no page fault + alloc), when page is
really needed. But your change merges these pages and kills this
optimization. Sounds not good, does this?

I think, we should not think we know and predict better than application
writers, what they want from kernel. Let's people decide themselves
in dependence of their workload. The only exception is some buggy
or old applications, which impossible to change, so force madvise
workaround may help. But only in case there are really such applications...

I'd researched what pages you have duplicated in these 526 MB. Maybe
you find, no action is required or a report to userspace application
to use madvise is needed.

IMO, this should be made only for tasks, which are known to be buggy
(which can't call madvise). Yes, scanning will be required.

For example,

Merge:
#echo $task > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/force_madvise

Unmerge:
#echo -$task > /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/force_madvise

In case of task don't want to merge some VMA, we just should skip it at all.

But firstly we probably should check, that we really need this, and why
existing applications don't call madvise directly. Now we just don't know,
what happens.

P.S. This all above is my opinion. Let's wait, what other people think.
