I am not sure there is such system which doesn't provide any high resolution
clocksource, meantime there is one high performance storage device
attached, and expect top IO performance can be reached.

Suppose there is such system: I mean that irq_flood_detected() returns either
true or false, then the actual IO performance should be accepted on
system without high resolution clocksource from user view.

The infrastructure is for predicating when the next interrupt comes,
which is used in PM cases(usually for mobile phone or power sensitive
cases). However, IRQ flood is used in high performance system(usually
enterprise case). The two use cases are actually orthogonal, also:

1) if the irq timing infrastructure is used, we have to apply the
management code on irq flood detection, for example, we have to
build the irq timing code in kernel and enable it. Then performance
regression might be caused for enterprise application.

2) irq timing's runtime overload is much higher, irq_timings_push()
touches much more memory footprint, since it records recent 32
irq's timestamp. That isn't what IRQ flood detection wants, also
not enough for flood detection.

3) irq flood detection itself is very simple, just one EWMA
calculation, see the following code:

irq_update_interval() (called from irq_enter())
        int cpu = raw_smp_processor_id();
        struct irq_interval *inter = per_cpu_ptr(&avg_irq_interval, cpu);
        u64 delta = sched_clock_cpu(cpu) - inter->last_irq_end;

        inter->avg = (inter->avg * IRQ_INTERVAL_EWMA_PREV_FACTOR +
                delta * IRQ_INTERVAL_EWMA_CURR_FACTOR) /
                IRQ_INTERVAL_EWMA_WEIGHT;

bool irq_flood_detected(void) (called from __handle_irq_event_percpu())
{
        return raw_cpu_ptr(&avg_irq_interval)->avg <= IRQ_FLOOD_THRESHOLD_NS;
}

irq_exit()
	inter->last_irq_end = sched_clock_cpu(smp_processor_id());

So there is basically nothing shared between the two, only one percpu
variable is needed for detecting irq flood.

Yeah, we can extend irq/timing, but ugly for irq/timing, since irq/timing
focuses on hardirq predication, and softirq isn't involved in that
purpose.

Yeah, I have looked at the code for a while, but I think that irq/timing
could become complicated unnecessarily for covering irq flood detection,
meantime it is much less efficient for detecting IRQ flood.
