I can fix that up.

Yes, that would make more sense. Instrumenting select_idle_capacity is
trivial so I'll fix that up too.

It's a deliberate choice so that when schedstat is disabled there is no
cost. While some schedstat sites lookup the current runqueue, not all of
them do. This might be a little wasteful when schedstats are enabled but
at least it's consistent.
