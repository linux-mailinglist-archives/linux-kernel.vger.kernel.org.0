>=20

Yes. Use protected-clocks to indicate what shouldn't be touched by the
kernel. It's not super easy to make it "generic" right now, but I
suppose we can work the flag into the core framework more so that we
still register the clks but otherwise make the 'clk_get()' operation
fail on them somehow and the disable unused operation skip them. I just
took the easy way out for qcom for the time being and didn't register
them from the driver.
