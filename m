I am saying that you may need the tcon top bus gates and resets properly
configured to be able to read/write the tcon top address range. That includes
enabling/disabling the clocks that the tcon top driver registers.

In other words, the TCON TOP's bus gate and reset control have everything to do
with what you can do within the TCON TOP block or address range.

See here. The value became 0 when it was still 0x10000 in the previous phase.
Any guesses to why this happened, assuming you didn't touch it?

Now if you keep the bus gate disabled and the reset control asserted, and
try to write some non-zero value to 0x1c70020, and read it back, does the
value stick?

If you don't have the bus gate enabled and the reset control de-asserted,
any operations you do to the TCON TOP is essentially not happening. Including
bit operations that the clocks you registered are required to do.

Get what I'm saying?

You need to have the bus gate enabled and the reset control de-asserted
BEFORE you register the clocks you are providing, or something is going
to go very wrong.

Worst case scenario: the reset control was left de-asserted by the bootloader
but the bus gate was disabled. When you register the clocks, the CCF tries
to read back the current status of the clocks, and the I/O stalls because
the bus gate wasn't enabled. System stalls.

Do I need to draw a time flow chart for you?

Also see the very simple example:

    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/clk/sunxi-ng/ccu-sun9i-a80-usb.c#L113

where the bus gate is enabled before registering the clocks. This hardware
block doesn't have a reset control for it, but the same principle applies.

> 0x44021000
> # devmem 0x1c70020
> 0x00000000

And it's still zero here, meaning the reset control does have an effect
on the TCON TOP registers.

This is irrelevant and not what I wanted you to try.
