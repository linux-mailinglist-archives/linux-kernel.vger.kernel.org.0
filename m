I'll Cc some treasure hunters. :)

Fair enough. It looked otherwise in the context, and we generally aim
for that as a soft rule.

Ok. That'd be worth a comment somewhere, since it adds a number of
things which would otherwise be unnecessary.

IIUC this assumes an adversary who knows the address of a task's
thread_info, and has an arbitrary-read (to extract the SCS base from
thead_info) and an arbitrary-write (to modify the SCS area).

Assuming that's the case, I don't think this buys much. If said
adversary controls two userspace threads A and B, they only need to wait
until A is context-switched out or in userspace, and read A's SCS base
using B.

Given that, I'd rather always store the SCS base in the thread_info, and
simplify the rest of the code manipulating it.

Thanks,
Mark.
