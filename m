According to the datasheet the device itself takes 10ms to rise from 0V
after PLLen is enabled. There are additional rise times but they are
negligible with default capacitor configuration (which we have).

Good to know about the regulator rising configuration though. Thanks.

Got it, thanks.

I return the error at the end of the function, but I'll bring it back here
for consistency.

Ok thanks, I didn't know about the "Switch" suffix, I will read
control-names.rst.

I will move Tristate to DT properties. I was also unsure about the
Impedance Efficiency Optimiser but the datasheet doesn't go into much
detail about this so I left it exposed.

They both seemed like user configurable options in the context of a
test rig, but I agree - who knows what this output might be connected
to in other systems. I will lock them down in DT. Thanks.

Ah no, I think that's a mistake. I want the PLLen to switch off in
idle/suspend and the device should restore on wake.

Yep on it.

Many thanks, I appreciate the feedback.
