Oh, I'm sad to read that, since I was yanking most of your commit
message (as "Yang Shi writes") into my version, to give stronger
and independent justification for the change.

If I try to write about QEMU and ballooning myself, nonsense is sure to
emerge; but I don't know what part "I would just remove that" refers to.

May I beg you for an updated paragraph or two, explaining why you
want to see the change?

Thanks,
Hugh
