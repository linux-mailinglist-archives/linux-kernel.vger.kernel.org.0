This spinlock not only protects dispatch list accesses but also 
modifications of the dispatch list. How about changing that comment into 
"protects the dispatch list"?

What is a worker? That word is not used anywhere in the block layer. How 
about changing that comment into "requests owned by this hardware queue"?

I'd prefer if algorithm details would be left out from structure 
documentation since such documentation becomes easily outdated. How 
about using something like the following description: "used for 
scheduling a hardware queue run at a later time"?

The word "workers" here is confusing. How about the following 
description: "used by blk_mq_hctx_next_cpu() for round-robin CPU 
selection from @cpumask"?

Again, I think this is too much detail about the actual algorithm.

That's a rather vague description. How about mentioning that this 
pointer is owned by the I/O scheduler that has been attached to a 
request queue and that the I/O scheduler decides how to use this pointer?

> +	/** @queue: Queue of request to be dispatched. */

How about "pointer to the request queue that owns this hardware context"?

Please add " in that software queue" at the end of the description.

Does the word "queue" refer to a request queue, software queue or 
hardware queue? Please make that clear.

That description doesn't look correct to me. I think that @dispatch_wait 
is used to wait if no tags are available. The comment above 
blk_mq_mark_tag_wait() is as follows:

/*
  * Mark us waiting for a tag. For shared tags, this involves hooking us
  * into the tag wakeups. For non-shared tags, we can simply mark us
  * needing a restart. For both cases, take care to check the condition
  * again after marking us as waiting.
  */

To be used by what?

>   	struct blk_mq_tags	*tags;
> +	/** @sched_tags: Request tags for schedulers. */
>   	struct blk_mq_tags	*sched_tags;

I think @tags represents tags owned by the block driver and @sched_tags 
represents tags owned by the I/O scheduler. If no I/O scheduler is 
associated with a request queue, only a driver tag is allocated. If an 
I/O scheduler has been associated with a request queue, a request is 
assigned a tag from @sched_tags when that request is allocated. A tag 
from @tags is only assigned when a request is dispatched to a hardware 
queue. See also blk_mq_get_driver_tag().

> +	/** @nr_active:	Number of active tags. */
>   	atomic_t		nr_active;

Isn't this the number of active requests instead of the number of active 
tags? Please mention that this member is only used when a tag set is 
shared across request queues.

How about changing this into "Request pointer"?

Is this really a list?

I'm not sure this change is an improvement.
