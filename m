As per my comments in other message, we should try to better split the
"latency nice" concept introduction (API and mechanisms) from its usage
in different scheduler code paths.

This distinction should be evident from the cover letter too. What you
use "latency nice" for is just one possible use-case, thus it's
important to make sure it's generic enough to fit other usages too.

I don't see why you latency-nice cannot be used to implement what you
get with NO_SIS_CORE.

IMHO, "latency nice" should be exposed as a pretty generic concept which
progressively enables different "levels of biasing" both at wake-up time
and load-balance time.

Why it's not possible to have SIS_CORE/NO_SIS_CORE switch implemented
just as different threshold values for the latency-nice value of a task?

Best,
Patrick
