Right, not applicable any more. Will drop this word.

The current one is bit more descriptive on detail. Anyways will replace with
the above writeup if that is preferred.

Sure, will do.

Thats true. This will get compiled for all combinations.

Sure, will do.

For the likes "page = p???_page(*p???p)" which got missed ? Will fix it.

Makes sense. Will do.

Will update both commit message and add an in-code comment here.

Its not absolutely necessary for linear map right now because both memory hot
plug & ptdump which modifies or walks the page table ranges respectively take
memory hotplug lock. That apart, no other callers creates or destroys linear
mapping at runtime.

> Is there a specific race when tearing down the vmemmap?

This is trickier than linear map. vmemmap additions would be protected with
memory hotplug lock but this can potential collide with vmalloc/IO regions.
Even if they dont right now that will be because they dont share intermediate
page table levels.

Memory hot-remove is not a very performance critical path. Not even as critical
as memory hot add. Hence its not worth relying on current non-overlapping kernel
virtual address range placement and reason it for not taking this critical lock
which might be problematic if things change later. Lets be on the safer side and
keep this lock.
