Note nothing.  I will remove it, sorry about that.

So, you would prefer to create a new "specialized" port driver that uses
platform resources?  I am not doing anything else different from
the generic port driver here in 8250_core.c.

Yes, this is same issue.

But the last part is not true.  A parent mfd driver might "use" a memory
resource for the sole purpose of splitting it up for it's mfd child
devices.  This is a core part of mfd framework, and not something I am
inventing with this patch.  I am just trying to make it possible to use
8250 driver in that context.

Mostly true.  But there is an important twist to the exclusive restriction.

The exclusive part of the request is limited to the the same root/parent
resource.

When you request a memory resource from the root resource
(iomem_resource), the resource returned can be used as a new parent
resource.  This new parent can then be used to give exclusive access to
slices of that resource.  When used like that, I expect that the parent
resource is not supposed to be used for anything else than honoring
resource requests.

And this is exactly what mfd-core uses the mem_base argument
in mfd_add_devices().

The parent is not and should not be doing that by itself.  The request
is done on by mfd-core when mfd_add_devices() is called.

I am not sure what you mean with this, but mfd drivers should not pass
along it's intire requested memory resource(s) to child devices.  The
child devices will get the requested resource slices, as implemented by
mfd_add_devices().

I hope you can see that I am not violating any fundamental design
decissions here, but actually try adhere to them (resource management,
platform_device resource management, and mfd-core).
