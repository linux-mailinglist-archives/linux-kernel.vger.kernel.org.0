These messages are pretty confusing. Subscript [0, 2] would refer to a
bi-dimensional array, while these are 1-dimension arrays. If [0, 2]
means something else, I still don't get it, because both indexes 0 and
2 are perfectly within bounds of a 3-element array. So what do these
messages mean exactly? Looks like a bogus checker to me.

So basically the code is fine, the checker (which checker, BTW?)
incorrectly thinks it isn't, and you propose to add dead code to make
the checker happy?

I disagree with this approach. Ideally the checker must be improved to
understand that the code is correct. If that's not possible, we should
be allowed to annotate the code to skip that specific check on these
specific lines, because it has been inspected by a knowledgeable human
and confirmed to be correct.

And if that it still not "possible", then the least intrusive fix would
be to make one of the valid cases the default. But adding new code
which will never be executed, but must still be compiled and stored,
no, thank you. Another code checker could legitimately complain about
that actually.

IMHO if code checkers return false positives then they are not helping
us and should not be used in the first place.
