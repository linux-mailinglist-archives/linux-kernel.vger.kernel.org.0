A day you have off, but still find yourself working ;-)

Hey! Does that mean we can add a static branch for that check?


struct static_key rcu_booting = STATIC_KEY_INIT_TRUE;

[...]

	if (READ_ONCE(rcu_state.gp_flags) ||
	    (current == t && !in_irq() && !in_serving_softirq())
		return;

	if (static_branch_unlikely(&rcu_booting) && !t)
		return;

At end of boot:

	static_key_disable(&rcu_booting);

That way we can really micro-optimize the slow path, and it basically
becomes a nop!
