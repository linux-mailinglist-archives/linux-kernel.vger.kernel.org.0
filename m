Hi Mike,
Thanks for your detailed explanation :)

I just want to use the minimize changes to address this issue, so I choosed a
way which my patch did.

To be honest, the approach you suggested above is much better though it need
more changes.

I think this is also needed, then we can request all supported size of hugepages
by sysfs(e.g. /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/*) dynamically. Currently, (x86) we can
only request 1G-hugepage through sysfs if we boot with 'default_hugepagesz=1G',
even with the first approach.


BTW, because it's not easy to discuss with you due to the time difference, I
have another question about the default hugepages to consult you here. Why the
/proc/meminfo only show the info about the default hugepages, but not others?
meminfo is more well know than sysfs, some ordinary users know meminfo but don't
know use the sysfs to get the hugepages status(e.g. total, free).
