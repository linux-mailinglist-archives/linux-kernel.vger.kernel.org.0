Sorry for a delay. I was analyzing and fixing comments, which were raised
in the framework of anther patchsets I've submitted. Some of them including
yours cause bigger changes than just a few fixups and might be resolved
at once by a solution I've described in RFC: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/22/393
You've been in Cc there, so feel free to send your comments.

Regarding ehb drivers. You are right. They should be moved to the drivers/bus
(it has also been described in the RFC). It is more suitable place for them.
I'll do it in v2.

Regarding l2 driver. Do you really think that L2 cache should be in
drivers/memory? First there is no any cache-related drivers in that
subsystem (at least I couldn't find any). Second the Baikal-T1
L2-cache-RAM config block has just indirect connection with RAM.
The block just tunes the L2-cache<->RAM stall clock cycles up on
WS/Tag/Data RAM IO-operations. This config seems more SoC-specific,
than memory-like. Do you think that the driver should still be in
drivers/memory?

On the other hand the block is part of the System Controller. I could
just embed the l2-cache driver functionality into the System Controller
MFD driver. Though honestly IMHO the functionality should live in
a dedicated driver and drivers/soc is a better place for it. I also have
doubts this part will be well accepted by Lee (drivers/mfd maintainer).

So what do you think?

Regards,
-Sergey
