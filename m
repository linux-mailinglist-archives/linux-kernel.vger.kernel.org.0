By incident, I got slightly sidetracked the other day and started 
looking at this as well. Got to the point where I figured out all the 
hairy alignment issues and actually got huge_fault() calls, but never 
implemented the handler. I think that's definitely something worth 
having. Not sure it will work for IO memory, though, (split_huge_pmd 
will just skip non-page-backed memory) but if we only support VM_SHARED 
(non COW) vmas there's no reason to split the huge pmds anyway. 
Definitely something we should have IMO.

I agree. This is needed for huge pages. We should make this change, and 
perhaps add the justification above as a comment.
