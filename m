Please interpret the RFC patch similar to an email as Joe wrote below, 
simply reaching out to you.

There is no auto-assignment intended, nor did I expect the patch to be 
picked up on the first attempt of uneducated guessing.

There are currently around 3,000 files identified being part of THE REST;
so they are all assigned to Linus and LKML.

To confirm that they actually are maintained by someone else and reflect 
that in MAINTAINERS, a bit of educated guessing who to contact and to 
which entry to add the files to is required.

I am starting with the "bigger" clustered files in drivers, and then try 
to look at files in include and Documentation/ABI/.

Here is a rough statistics on how many files from each directory are in
THE REST:

   1368 include
    566 tools
    327 lib
    321 Documentation
    100 drivers
     91 kernel
     84 scripts
     75 samples
     13 ipc
     13 init
      8 usr
      2 arch
      1 virt

Thanks for the proposal; I was not sure about the best way to reach out to 
others on suggesting to add new entries.

In the future, I will simply send out emails, as those above, when 
suggesting to add new entries.

Thanks for the feedback and sorry for the churn. Once most files are 
assigned, it is much easier to follow when someone missed to adjust the 
MAINTAINERS file and send out a friendly hint. I hope that is worth the 
initial churn for some people at the beginning of this clean-up.
