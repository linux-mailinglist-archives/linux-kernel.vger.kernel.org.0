That is discussed later in the document, and the reporter can offer up
people, but that's about it.  It's up to us running the list to be the
ones in charge of this, and that's one of the main reasons this document
exists.

I'll leave the wording as-is for now, given all of the lawyers who have
already agreed with it.  If we find people objecting to how it all is
written now in the future, we can revisit it.

We can handle such cases if and when it arises.  And who's to say it

Jiri posted an update with more names.

The blank lines are there for where we want names.  I have a bunch of
people who have agreed, but I want them sending add-on patches for the
document, with their s-o-b on it, so that everyone "knows" they really
agree with this, and that someone didn't just add their name to the
document without them realizing.

We have a private web right now, and it's the best we have at the
moment.  So until we get something else, let's stick with it.

Many thanks for the edits, I'll send out a new version soon.
