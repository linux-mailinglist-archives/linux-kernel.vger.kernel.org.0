If you think you need to save the few bits this potentially saves you
over just encoding 8bit enum like in Qiang's original patch I think
you get to type a few macros and comments ...

Well can't really take a modifier without knowing what it's for, I
guess this is up to lima/panfrost folks then to figure out :-P
