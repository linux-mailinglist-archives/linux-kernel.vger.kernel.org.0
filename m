The flag hints the user that the pinned timers will always be run on a
static CPU (because that should be what "pinned" means...) but that's
not the truth, at least with current implementation.

For example, currently if we setup a pinned timer but later on we call
mod_timer() upon the pinned timer, the mod_timer() will still try to
run the timer on the current processor and migrate the timer if
necessary.  In other words, the suggested way to arm a pinned timer
should be add_timer_on() always.  mod_timer() can be used in this case
only if current processor is the one that we want to pin the timer on.

Document it a bit with the definition of TIMER_PINNED so that all
future users will use it correctly.
