I admit we have been not fair for them because read(2) syscall pages are
easily promoted regardless of zap timing unlike mmap-based pages.

However, if we remove the mark_page_accessed in the zap_pte_range, it
would make them more unfair in that read(2)-accessed pages are easily
promoted while mmap-based page should go through refault to be promoted.

I also want to remove the costly overhead from the hot path but couldn't
come up with nice solution.
