I disagree Marc. This is a rather bad error which indicates that the device-tree
is probably incorrect (or the HW was wired in a way that cannot work).

Basically a given FIC can either be entirely level sensitive or entirely edge
sensitive. This catches cases where the DT has routed a mixed of both to the
same FIC. Definitely worth barfing loudly about rather than trying to understand
subtle odd misbehaviours of the device in the field.

Cheers,
Ben.
