Oh, so either way it's effectively a rerun of the U8500 problem of 
having no guarantee that the interrupt will be taken on an appropriate 
CPU, and losing genuine events as apparently spurious if it isn't. Yeah, 
that's really really bad... :(

Agreed, pretending that this might work without significantly more 
invasive workarounds does more harm than good.
