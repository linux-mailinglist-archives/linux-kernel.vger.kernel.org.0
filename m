I did find this in the linked pdf:

  | If the store [swx] is successful, the sequence of instructions from
  | the semaphore load to the semaphore store appear to be executed
  | atomically - no other device modified the semaphore location between
  | the read and the update.

which sounds like we're ok, although it could be better worded.

One part I haven't figured out is what happens if you take an interrupt
between the lwx and the swx and whether you can end up succeeding thanks
to somebody else's reservation. Also, the manual is silent about the
interaction with TLB invalidation and just refers to "address" when
talking about the reservation. What happens if a user thread triggers
CoW while another is in the middle of a lwx/swx?
