I have brought up side channel attacks earlier [1] but only in the
context of shared page cache pages. I didn't really consider shared
anonymous pages to be a real problem. I was under impression that CoW
pages shouldn't be a real problem because any security sensible
applications shouldn't allow untrusted code to be forked and CoW
anything really important. I believe we have made this assumption
in other places - IIRC on gup with FOLL_FORCE but I admit I have
very happily forgot most details.
