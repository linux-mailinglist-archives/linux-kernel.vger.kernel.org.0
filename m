Yes. Reclaim doesn't need to block, the entire operation itself is an
interruption of the workload that only happens due to a lack of RAM.

Of course, as long as kswapd is just picking up one-off cache, it does
not take a whole lot of time, and it will barely register as
pressure. But as memory demand mounts and we have to look harder for
unused pages, reclaim time can become significant, even without IO.

vmpressure is an orthogonal feature that is based purely on reclaim
efficiency (reclaimed/scanned).

psi accounting begins when we first call into try_to_free_pages() and
friends. psi_memstall_enter() marks the task, and it's the scheduler
part of psi that aggregates task state time into pressure ratios.

Memory pressure metrics really seem unrelated to this problem, and
that's not what vmpressure or psi try to solve in the first place.

When you say we need better IO pressure feedback / congestion
throttling in reclaim, I can believe it, even though it's not
something we necessarily observed in our fleet.
