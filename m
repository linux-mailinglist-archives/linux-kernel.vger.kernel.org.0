Changes since v2:
1. Keep description of consumers in power-domain.txt,
2. Rename power_domain.txt to power-domain.txt,
3. Indent example with four spaces (more readable).

Changes since v1:
1. Select all nodes for consumers,
2. Remove from consumers duplicated properties with dt-schema,
3. Fix power domain pattern,
4. Remove unneeded types.

+description: |+
+  System on chip designs are often divided into multiple PM domains that can be
+  used for power gating of selected IP blocks for power saving by reduced leakage
+  current.
+
+  This device tree binding can be used to bind PM domain consumer devices with
+  their PM domains provided by PM domain providers. A PM domain provider can be
+  represented by any node in the device tree and can provide one or more PM
+  domains. A consumer node can refer to the provider by a phandle and a set of
+  phandle arguments (so called PM domain specifiers) of length specified by the
+  \#power-domain-cells property in the PM domain provider node.
