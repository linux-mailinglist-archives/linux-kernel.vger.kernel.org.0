I am not going to attempt to define parameters for user defined values
of min_free_kbytes.  Someone smarter than me can take that on.  Documentation
is pretty clear that user is allowed to do bad things which will immediately
cause them problems.

I'm going to explicitly send out the v2 version of patch.  It is not something
I feel strongly about.  Just an attempt to clean up some inconsistencies
observed while looking at something else.
