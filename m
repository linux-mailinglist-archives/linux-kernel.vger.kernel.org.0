The crashkernel reservation for kdump is a must, there are already a lot
of different problems need to consider, for example the low and high
memory issues, and a lot of other things.  I'm not convinced to enable
this for kexec reboot.

This really looks to workaround the arm64 issue and move the
complication to kernel.
