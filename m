Exactly before it make a way into other projects!

Thats not the point, point is about right fix!

I don't agree with you on that. We should not take an extra refcount in 
first place in driver.

let me explain it one more time!

dmabuf has to be mmaped in userspace app before it is used, and
"Memory mappings that were created in the process shall be unmapped 
before the process is destroyed" so the refcount is taken care by 
mmap/unmap automatically.
