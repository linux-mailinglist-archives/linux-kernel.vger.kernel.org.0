Actually, I'm not very concerned by this. In our design each memcg has
its dedicated work (memcg->wmark_work), so the reclaim work for
different memcgs could be run in parallel since they are *different*
work in fact although they run the same function. And, We could queue
them to a dedicated unbound workqueue which may have maximum 512 or
scale with nr cpus active works. Although the system may have
thousands of online memcgs, I'm supposed it should be rare to have all
of them trigger reclaim at the same time.
