sorry, I meant "hardware has a default value but it's actually
adjustable (by software)". Adjusting hardware is the best option but
our hub doesn't allow to do that, so the current approach is patching
a hardware descriptor on enumeration stage.

I thought just changing urb->interval at runtime will be more acceptable.
Maybe I'll need an another approach if this patch is unacceptable.
