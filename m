Nit: I expect that a much larger region than that is *accessible*, 
although it's quite plausible that only that region is actually 
*accessed*/used right now.

Why does the driver blindly map the entire memory at all? Surely it 
should only map the portions of RAM that other drivers request/use? And 
surely the BPMP driver or DT node is already providing that information?

But yes, changing the mapping type to avoid speculation might be an 
acceptable solution for now, although I think we'd want to work things 
out better later. I don't know if there would be any impact to the BPMP 
driver related to the slower SRAM access due to this change. Best 
consult a BPMP expert or Tegra maintainer about that.
