usb-role-switch is needed when mode == "otg" or "peripheral".

Device mode is detected via vbus GPIO irrespective of mode being 
peripheral only or OTG.
Host mode is detected via id-gpio, in OTG case.

When mode is peripheral, role changes happens between USB_ROLE_DEVICE 
and USB_ROLE_NONE, which are generally based on Vbus GPIO(hot plug) 
detection.

When mode is otg, role changes happens between USB_ROLE_HOST, 
USB_ROLE_DEVICE and USB_ROLE_NONE, which are detected via id-gpio, 
vbus-gpio and no detection respectively.
