Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh,
Dear Friend
How are you today,I came across your e-mail contact prior a private
search while in need of your assistance.
  I hope my mail meet you in good condition of health? Dear I have
decided to contact you after much thought considering the fact that we
have not meet before, but because of some circumstance obliged me, I
decided to contact you due to the urgency of my present situation here
in the refugee camp for your rescue and also for a business
venture/project which I need your assistant in this business
establishment in your country as my foreign partner as well as my
legal appointed trustee.

I am Aisha Muammar Gaddafi, the only daughter of the embattled
president of Libya, Hon. Muammar Gaddafi. Am a   single Mother and a
Widow with three Children.
  I am currently residing in Burkina Faso unfortunately as a refugee.
I am writing this mail with tears and sorrow from my heart asking for
your urgent help. I have passed through pains and sorrowful moment
since the death of my late father.

At the meantime, my family is the target of Western nations led by
Nato who wants to destroy my father at all costs. Our investments and
bank accounts in several countries are their targets to freeze. My
Father of blessed memory deposited the sum of  Twenty Seven Million,
Five Hundred Thousand, Dollars ($27.500.000.000)  in  Bank Of Africa
Burkina Faso which he used my name as the next of kin. I have been
commissioned by the Bank to present an interested foreign
investor/partner who can stand as my trustee and receive the fund in
his account for a possible investment in his country due to my refugee
status here in Burkina Faso.

I am in search of an honest and reliable person who will help me and
stand as my trustee so that I will present him to the Bank for the
transfer of the fund to his bank account overseas. I have chosen to
contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my
trust. But rather take me as your own sister or daughter. If this
transaction interest you, you don't have to disclose it to anybody
because of what is going with my entire family, if the united nation
happens to know this account, they will freezing it as they froze
others, so please keep this transaction only to yourself until we
finalize it. I am willing to negotiate investment/business profit
sharing ratio
with you base on the future investment earning profits.

Apologetic for my pictures I will enclose it in my next mail and more
about me when I hear from you okay. Please I want you to contact me
here (aishagaddafi110@hotmail.com) for more conversation. Thank and
Best Regards, Yours Sincerely.

Warmest Regards,
Aisha Gaddafi
