I looked in the MSM 3.4 and 3.10 sources and I can't find that gfx3d
clock in the mmss (the downstream name for the mmcc that's upstream). I
even looked through the git history in the 3.10 sources to see if it was
removed at some point.

The gfx3d_clk_src was added to mmcc-msm8974.c upstream at the time the
file was first introduced into the kernel:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d8b212014e69d6b6323773ce6898f224ef4ed0d6
I haven't been able to find anything else so far where that came from.

The GPU works using kmscube and KDE Plasma Mobile with this patch
applied but won't work without it. As for the status of the GPU working
upstream for MSM8974: My OCMEM and interconnect patches are now in
linux-next and are queued for the next merge window. All that's left is
1) iommu support, 2) this patch (or whatever it needs to become), and
3) add the GPU nodes to device tree for this board.

Would you be willing to reconsider accepting this patch since its 8974
specific and is one of the pieces that gets the GPU working upstream?

Thanks,

Brian
