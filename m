Subject: [PATCH] tools/memory-model: Update the informal documentation
Date:   Sat, 29 Jun 2019 23:10:44 +0200
Message-Id: <1561842644-5354-1-git-send-email-andrea.parri@amarulasolutions.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The formal memory consistency model has added support for plain accesses
(and data races).  While updating the informal documentation to describe
this addition to the model is highly desirable and important future work,
update the informal documentation to at least acknowledge such addition.

 Optimizing compilers have great freedom in the way they translate

 LIMITATIONS
 ===========
 
-The Linux-kernel memory model has the following limitations:
-
-1.	Compiler optimizations are not modeled.  Of course, the use
-	of READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE() limits the compiler's ability
-	to optimize, but there is Linux-kernel code that uses bare C
-	memory accesses.  Handling this code is on the to-do list.
-	For more information, see Documentation/explanation.txt (in
-	particular, the "THE PROGRAM ORDER RELATION: po AND po-loc"
-	and "A WARNING" sections).
