Hi David,

Thank you for your reply.

Our goal is not really a work around what is available and what the VRF 
can do.
The main issue (you already scratched in you email) is the consistency 
between IPv4 L3VPN and IPv6 L3VPN.
We can use the VRF device for End.DT4 but this will lead to 
inconsistency with End.DT6 as it uses the table instead.
This becomes hard to operate as provisioning the IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs 
needs to be done in different ways.

We would appreciate to get get your thoughts/advices on that and how we 
should go forward.

Regards,
Ahmed
