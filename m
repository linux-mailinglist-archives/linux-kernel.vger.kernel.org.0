It looks like complete garbage to me.  That might just be because it
uses tons of terms I've never heard of of and which aren't used anywhere
in the DMA API.  It also might be because it doesn't explain how the
flag might actually be practically useful.

Which means it should have never been merged.  As a general policy we do
not add code to the Linux kernel without actual users.
