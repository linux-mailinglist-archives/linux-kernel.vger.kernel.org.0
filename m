That's because it is not just "one" symbol per module.

If it were, you can just parse the Makefiles and get that single config
option for most modules, right?  But even then, multiple options can
influence a single module as to what actually gets built into that
module.

So, I would say, "who really cares"?

People who want to "slim" down things are rare, and it's usually worth
it to work backwards anyway (see what functionality is needed and then
go from there, not look at the modules themselves).  Or use a tool like
'make localmodconfig' and trim.

It's hard to determine "what you really need" :)

Use localmodconfig and you have a great start, then prune from there.
Trying to put _all_ configuration dependencies in a single module isn't
going to work, our configuration language does not distill down to that.
