That is a prerequisite of UEFI/ACPI.  All clocks, registers, phys,
resets, etc must be configured by the firmware.  We should only need
to play with them for Power Management purposes (which requires the
PEP to be enabled).

I think you're viewing this from the wrong angle.  The "ACPI
enablement" commit(s) merely prevented the use of the Clock and
Regulator APIs, as per the ACPI guidelines.  See [0].

Right.  Unfortunately, I developed this on top of our DT enablement
patches, which also included your Geni SE DMA and Regulator status
hacks, which meant I missed this and the above until now.

It's only now I've had the chance to attempt to boot raw Mainline that
these came to light, hence the last minute panic to try and fix them.

We *can* do that, however my fear is that the distros are going to be
releasing their new versions (next month) based on v5.3.  Which would
mean they will not boot on these platforms until they backport these
patches, which might be some months later.

This is the only issue that prevents ACPI from booting, meaning we can
at least make use of the distro installers when they are released.
The patch is very simple and low-risk, so ideally it would go into
-rc7.
