Can't you push the **dev_groups from platform driver down to the
generic driver structure and handle them in driver_sysfs_add()?

I guess once you push it all into core you'll end up with 2 uevents
being emitted back-to-back and this seems inefficient.

If you really want KOBJ_CHANGE maybe have some additional attribute
like "CHANGE=driver-specific-attrs" in it? It's all quite ugly though.

Thanks.
