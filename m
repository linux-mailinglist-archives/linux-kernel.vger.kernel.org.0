It's slightly more subtle than that -- for broadcast maintenance the
policy of the CPU receiving the broadcast matters.

So even if all i-cache maintenance were performed on a thread pinned to
a CPU with PIPT caches, to correctly affect any VIPT i-caches in the
system it would be necessary to perform maintenance as-if the CPU
performing the maintenance had VIPT i-caches.

Thanks,
Mark.
