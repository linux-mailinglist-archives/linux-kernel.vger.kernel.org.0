Thanks for working to improve the documentation!  That said, I think this
patch needs a fair amount of work before we are ready to accept it.  I'll
only get partway in, but it should be enough to start with.

The first overall thing I would like to point out (and hopefully the SCSI
folks won't fight me too much on this) is that Documentation/scsi is the
wrong place for much of this stuff.  We are doing our best to organize the
documentation with the audience in mind.  So, for example, documents that
are of interest to system administrators should go into
Documentation/admin-guide.  Information for driver developers should go in
Documentation/driver-api.  And so on.

This isn't your fault, but...*which* parameter allows this?  The document
describes the values, but not where they can be set.  That makes it less
than fully useful.

Two notes:

 - You can put the double colon on the line above ("...elements::") and
   don't need to make a separate line for it.

 - But, more to the point, please avoid the temptation to use a literal
   block for something that doesn't actually require that treatment. This
   should be reworked as an RST definition list.

Perhaps we don't *really* need to preserve information about what versions
were around in the 1990's?

That document claims to have been last updated in 2002.  Is there really
nothing more recent than that?

...and it's unclear to me that users of the 5.x kernel are much concerned
with what was found in 2.4.

That is the problem with this document in general.  I suspect that about
the only useful information left in it is the location of the sg3_utils
source.  I honestly don't think that it helps the documentation that much
to carry forward ancient information to the RST format.

Of course, doing this right by deleting obsolete information and updating
the documents to reflect current reality is a *lot* more work.  Probably
far more than you were thinking of signing up for.  If you were willing to
work on this, there may be somebody from the SCSI community who would be in
a position to help you with it.

Unfortunately, the SCSI community probably did not see this patch because
you didn't copy the linux-scsi list.  I'll fix that now, but they will not
have seen your original patch.  You should be sure to include them on
future postings.

I would like to make a suggestion, in addition to all of the above: rather
than trying to do a mass conversion in a single 4000-line patch, start with
a single file and post a patch doing just that one, being sure to include
the linux-scsi list.  That will give everybody something more workable to
start with.

Thanks,

jon
