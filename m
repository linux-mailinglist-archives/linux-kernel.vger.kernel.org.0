In your case, CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_DEFAULT_OFF=y, so it disables itself
irrespective of the pool size and trips over the bug. Even with default
off, it still involves the clean-up since kmemleak needs to track early
allocations in case it is turned on by the kmemleak=on cmdline option.

So I think 16000 is sufficient in your case, the default-off triggered
the bug (well, unless you find in the logs "kmemleak: Memory pool empty,
consider increasing CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_MEM_POOL_SIZE").
