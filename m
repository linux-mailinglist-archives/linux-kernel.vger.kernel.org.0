Now, if you are worried that fuzzing will cause harm, or crash the kernel,
it sounds to me, whatever fuzzing did would satisfy Matthew's "integrity of
the kernel" portion.

In other words, I believe fuzzing folks should be working with the lockdown
folks and letting the lockdown folks how root can crash the system. I would
think from a security point of view, that if there's a known method to take
down the kernel, and I don't want root to be able to do so, we should
either fix the kernel to not be able to do so, or if that interface is "you
should know what you are doing" then it should be something an admin could
lock down to keep other admins who don't know what they are doing from
crashing the system.

Or teach the fuzz tool not to do specific bad things.

Honestly, if you just go with a single config to prevent interfaces from
crashing the system while running a fuzz test, then you just lowered the
usefulness of the fuzz test, as it will never find legitimate cases where
that interface crashed the kernel when it should not have.

We are currently trying to clean up the tracing / probing code to not be
able to crash the kernel with any interface. It's hard, but it is a goal.
