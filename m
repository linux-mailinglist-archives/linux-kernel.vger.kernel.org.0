This patch is a workaround for the cgroup tree blowing up with zombie
cgroups. Roman's slab reparenting patches are fixing the zombies, so
we shouldn't need this anymore.

Because with or without the direct reclaim rule, we still don't want
offline cgroups to accumulate like this. They also slow down kswapd,
and they eat a ton of RAM.

cgroup2 was affected by the offline memcgs just as much as cgroup1 -
probably even more so because it tracks more types of memory per
default. That's why Roman worked tirelessly on a solution.

But we shouldn't keep those bandaid patches around forever.
