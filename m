Well, um, that document seems to be based on TPM 1.2 ... a lot of what
it says isn't quite true for TPM 2.0.  For instance all TPM 2.0 primary
keys come with a symmetric component, so the sealed data in TPM 2.0 is
actually symmetrically encrypted to a primary key.

The problem TPM 2.0 has is that most of them can't generate prime
numbers very fast, so even through the kernel could generate the RSA
primary, it would usually take far too long, so if you want to use a
RSA primary you have to pre-generate one and place it in NV storage;
the TCG recommends doing this at handle 81000001, which is what you
have above.  However, the more modern way is to derive an elliptic
curve key primary key every time ... EC keys can be generated by most
TPMs in 10s of milliseconds, so the primary doesn't need to be present
in NVRAM.

THe kernel should be using the EC primary method for the parent.  The
only exception is when the key has an intermediate parent, and then it
can be simply loaded from a file.

Well, the API is confusing, but the code seems to imply the parent
should be present somehow.  A key in NVRAM, like 81000001 is always
present so it doesn't need to be loaded it can just be used as is.

As I said, using policy handles simply won't scale, so we need to use
the actual policy instead ... thus the policy should be passed into the
kernel  as part of the trusted key and the kernel itself would generate
a policy session from the policy statements ... this approach is aready
proven to be useful and functional in the tpm2 openssl engine code.
