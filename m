That's a good question. They should have similar attributes.

The main issue with the inner-shareable attributes and the GIC is that
nothing in the spec says that CPUs and GIC have to be in the same
inner-shareable domain, as the system can have as many as you want.

You obviously have built it with GICR in the same inner-shareability
domain as the CPU. I'm happy to change the VPENDBASER attributes,
given that the CPU has a mapping to that memory already, and that
shouldn't affect systems where GICR isn't in the same inner shareable
domain anyway.

Thanks,
