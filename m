The current way to represent complex digitial routing inside SoCs is to
use DPCM, this is not great and causes a bunch of problems with the
framework but it's at least consistent between SoCs and is less visible
to the ABI than this is.  Ideally what we'd be doing is propagating
digital configuration along audio paths like we do for analog with DAPM,
Morimoto-san has done a lot of the groundwork for doing that with
converting everything to components but nobody has worked on that yet.
Your stuff looks a lot more like this than it does DPCM at the minute
but it completely sidesteps the digital configuration part of things
without trying to integrate with the framework which isn't great.

I'm really not thrilled about the idea of just hacking around the side
of things like this is doing, the ideal thing would be starting the work
on the framework to propagate digital configuration - I *think* you can
get away with only a subset of the problem here (just copying
configuration straight through) since this looks like it's just straight
point to point links with little in the way of DSP.  If not DPCM would
be the way to go I think.
