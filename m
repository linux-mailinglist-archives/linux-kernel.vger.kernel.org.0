"low-speed/full-speed/high-speed/wireless" options are invalid to a usb3 port
because a usb3 port is not capable of operating at
low-/full-/high-speed/wireless protocols. Therefore,
maximum-speed="low-/full-/high-speed/wireless" is something more like completely
disabling the usb3 port than just disabling super-speed-plus.

I see using an existing "maximum-speed" is preferred. Please review code change
in v5 and let me know if anything could be improved further.

Yes, I feel the same. I will send a patch for it.
