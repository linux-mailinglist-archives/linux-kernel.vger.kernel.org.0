I really like the whole series - this is how it should have been 
implemented originally, but the exit scenarios 'looked' so simple so it 
was just open-coded ... Mea culpa. :-)

As to ->futex_exit_mutex: that's really just a consequence of the ABI, 
and a lot cleaner than all the previous pretense that these exit ops are 
atomic - which they fundamentally aren't.

Haven't tested the series beyond build coverage, but the high level 
principles behind the whole series look very sound to me:
