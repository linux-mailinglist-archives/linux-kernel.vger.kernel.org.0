Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: misc-devices: mei: Convert mei txt files to reST
Date:   Sun, 30 Jun 2019 03:02:03 +0530
Message-Id: <20190629213203.5887-1-shreeya.patel23498@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Convert the MEI misc device's documentation files from .txt to
reStructuredText format. Make a minor change of correcting the
wrong macro name MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT_IOCTL to IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT.
Add an index file in mei as there are two sections for it in the
documentation.

I am not sure if I have placed the Documentation in the right place
so I would like to get some suggestions from the MAINTAINERS on this
part.

+Intel(R) Management Engine (ME) Client bus API
+==============================================
+
+
+Rationale
+=========
+
+MEI misc character device is useful for dedicated applications to send and receive
+data to the many FW appliance found in Intel's ME from the user space.
+However for some of the ME functionalities it make sense to leverage existing software
+stack and expose them through existing kernel subsystems.
+
+In order to plug seamlessly into the kernel device driver model we add kernel virtual
+bus abstraction on top of the MEI driver. This allows implementing linux kernel drivers
+for the various MEI features as a stand alone entities found in their respective subsystem.
+Existing device drivers can even potentially be re-used by adding an MEI CL bus layer to
+the existing code.
+
+
+MEI CL bus API
+==============
+
+A driver implementation for an MEI Client is very similar to existing bus
+based device drivers. The driver registers itself as an MEI CL bus driver through
+the :c:type:`mei_cl_driver` structure:
+
+::
+
+        struct mei_cl_driver {
+	        struct device_driver driver;
+	        const char *name;
+
+	        const struct mei_cl_device_id *id_table;
+
+	        int (*probe)(struct mei_cl_device *dev, const struct mei_cl_id *id);
+	        int (*remove)(struct mei_cl_device *dev);
+        };
+
+        struct mei_cl_id {
+	        char name[MEI_NAME_SIZE];
+	        kernel_ulong_t driver_info;
+        };
+
+
+The :c:type:`mei_cl_id` structure allows the driver to bind itself against a device name.
+
+To actually register a driver on the ME Client bus one must call the :c:func:`mei_cl_add_driver()`
+API. This is typically called at module init time.
+
+Once registered on the ME Client bus, a driver will typically try to do some I/O on
+this bus and this should be done through the :c:func:`mei_cl_send()` and :c:func:`mei_cl_recv()`
+routines. The latter is synchronous (blocks and sleeps until data shows up).
+In order for drivers to be notified of pending events waiting for them (e.g.
+an Rx event) they can register an event handler through the
+:c:func:`mei_cl_register_event_cb()` routine. Currently only the :c:macro:`MEI_EVENT_RX` event
+will trigger an event handler call and the driver implementation is supposed
+to call :c:func:`mei_recv()` from the event handler in order to fetch the pending
+received buffers.
+
+
+Example
+=======
+
+As a theoretical example let's pretend the ME comes with a "contact" NFC IP.
+The driver init and exit routines for this device would look like:
+
+::
+
+        #define CONTACT_DRIVER_NAME "contact"
+
+        static struct mei_cl_device_id contact_mei_cl_tbl[] = {
+	        { CONTACT_DRIVER_NAME, },
+	        /* required last entry */
+	        { }
+        };
+        MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(mei_cl, contact_mei_cl_tbl);
+
+        static struct mei_cl_driver contact_driver = {
+	        .id_table = contact_mei_tbl,
+	        .name = CONTACT_DRIVER_NAME,
+	        .probe = contact_probe,
+	        .remove = contact_remove,
+        };
+
+        static int contact_init(void)
+        {
+	        int r;
+
+	        r = mei_cl_driver_register(&contact_driver);
+	        if (r) {
+		        pr_err(CONTACT_DRIVER_NAME ": driver registration failed\n");
+		        return r;
+	        }
+
+	        return 0;
+        }
+
+        static void __exit contact_exit(void)
+        {
+	        mei_cl_driver_unregister(&contact_driver);
+        }
+
+        module_init(contact_init);
+        module_exit(contact_exit);
+
+And the driver's simplified probe routine would look like that:
+
+::
+
+        int contact_probe(struct mei_cl_device *dev, struct mei_cl_device_id *id)
+        {
+	        struct contact_driver *contact;
+
+	        [...]
+	        mei_cl_enable_device(dev);
+
+	        mei_cl_register_event_cb(dev, contact_event_cb, contact);
+
+	        return 0;
+        }
+
+In the probe routine the driver first enable the MEI device and then registers
+an ME bus event handler which is as close as it can get to registering a
+threaded IRQ handler.
+The handler implementation will typically call some I/O routine depending on
+the pending events:
+
+::
+
+        #define MAX_NFC_PAYLOAD 128
+
+        static void contact_event_cb(struct mei_cl_device *dev, u32 events,
+                                     void *context)
+        {
+	        struct contact_driver *contact = context;
+
+	        if (events & BIT(MEI_EVENT_RX)) {
+		        u8 payload[MAX_NFC_PAYLOAD];
+		        int payload_size;
+
+		        payload_size = mei_recv(dev, payload, MAX_NFC_PAYLOAD);
+		        if (payload_size <= 0)
+			        return;
+
+		        /* Hook to the NFC subsystem */
+		        nfc_hci_recv_frame(contact->hdev, payload, payload_size);
+	        }
+        }

+Intel(R) Management Engine Interface
+====================================
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+The Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) is an isolated and protected computing
+resource (Co-processor) residing inside certain Intel chipsets. The Intel ME
+provides support for computer/IT management features. The feature set
+depends on the Intel chipset SKU.
+
+The Intel Management Engine Interface (Intel MEI, previously known as HECI)
+is the interface between the Host and Intel ME. This interface is exposed
+to the host as a PCI device. The Intel MEI Driver is in charge of the
+communication channel between a host application and the Intel ME feature.
+
+Each Intel ME feature (Intel ME Client) is addressed by a GUID/UUID and
+each client has its own protocol. The protocol is message-based with a
+header and payload up to 512 bytes.
+
+Prominent usage of the Intel ME Interface is to communicate with Intel(R)
+Active Management Technology (Intel AMT) implemented in firmware running on
+the Intel ME.
+
+Intel AMT provides the ability to manage a host remotely out-of-band (OOB)
+even when the operating system running on the host processor has crashed or
+is in a sleep state.
+
+Some examples of Intel AMT usage are:
+        * Monitoring hardware state and platform components
+        * Remote power off/on (useful for green computing or overnight IT
+          maintenance)
+        * OS updates
+        * Storage of useful platform information such as software assets
+        * Built-in hardware KVM
+        * Selective network isolation of Ethernet and IP protocol flows based
+          on policies set by a remote management console
+        * IDE device redirection from remote management console
+
+Intel AMT (OOB) communication is based on SOAP (deprecated
+starting with Release 6.0) over HTTP/S or WS-Management protocol over
+HTTP/S that are received from a remote management console application.
+
+For more information about Intel AMT:
+`<http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide>`_
+
+
+Intel MEI Driver
+================
+
+The driver exposes a misc device called :file:`/dev/mei`.
+
+An application maintains communication with an Intel ME feature while
+:file:`/dev/mei` is open. The binding to a specific feature is performed by calling
+:c:macro:`IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT`, which passes the desired UUID.
+The number of instances of an Intel ME feature that can be opened
+at the same time depends on the Intel ME feature, but most of the
+features allow only a single instance.
+
+The Intel AMT Host Interface (Intel AMTHI) feature supports multiple
+simultaneous user connected applications. The Intel MEI driver
+handles this internally by maintaining request queues for the applications.
+
+The driver is transparent to data that are passed between firmware feature
+and host application.
+
+Because some of the Intel ME features can change the system
+configuration, the driver by default allows only a privileged
+user to access it.
+
+A code snippet for an application communicating with Intel AMTHI client:
+
+::
+
+        struct mei_connect_client_data data;
+        fd = open(MEI_DEVICE);
+
+        data.d.in_client_uuid = AMTHI_UUID;
+
+        ioctl(fd, IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT, &data);
+
+        printf("Ver=%d, MaxLen=%ld\n",
+               data.d.in_client_uuid.protocol_version,
+               data.d.in_client_uuid.max_msg_length);
+
+        [...]
+
+        write(fd, amthi_req_data, amthi_req_data_len);
+
+        [...]
+
+        read(fd, &amthi_res_data, amthi_res_data_len);
+
+        [...]
+
+        close(fd);
+
+
+IOCTL
+=====
+
+The Intel MEI Driver supports the following IOCTL commands:
+
+
+:c:macro:`IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT`
+-------------------------------------
+Connect to firmware Feature (client)
+
+**Usage:**
+
+::
+
+        struct mei_connect_client_data clientData;
+        ioctl(fd, IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT, &clientData);
+
+**Inputs:**
+        :c:type:`mei_connect_client_data` - structure contain the following
+        input field.
+
+        :c:data:`in_client_uuid` - UUID of the FW Feature that needs to connect to.
+
+**Outputs:**
+        :c:data:`out_client_properties` - Client Properties: MTU and Protocol Version.
+

+
+Intel ME Applications
+=====================
+
+1) Intel Local Management Service (Intel LMS)
+
+        Applications running locally on the platform communicate with Intel AMT Release
+        2.0 and later releases in the same way that network applications do via SOAP
+        over HTTP (deprecated starting with Release 6.0) or with WS-Management over
+        SOAP over HTTP. This means that some Intel AMT features can be accessed from a
+        local application using the same network interface as a remote application
+        communicating with Intel AMT over the network.
+
+        When a local application sends a message addressed to the local Intel AMT host
+        name, the Intel LMS, which listens for traffic directed to the host name,
+        intercepts the message and routes it to the Intel MEI.
+        For more information:
+        `<http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide>`_
+        Under "About Intel AMT" => "Local Access"
+
+        For downloading Intel LMS:
+        `<http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-the-latest-intel-amt-open-source-drivers/>`_
+
+        The Intel LMS opens a connection using the Intel MEI driver to the Intel LMS
+        firmware feature using a defined UUID and then communicates with the feature
+        using a protocol called Intel AMT Port Forwarding Protocol (Intel APF protocol).
+        The protocol is used to maintain multiple sessions with Intel AMT from a
+        single application.
+
+        See the protocol specification in the `Intel AMT Software Development Kit (SDK)
+        <http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide>`_
+        Under "SDK Resources" => "Intel(R) vPro(TM) Gateway (MPS)"
+        => "Information for Intel(R) vPro(TM) Gateway Developers"
+        => "Description of the Intel AMT Port Forwarding (APF) Protocol"
+
+2) Intel AMT Remote configuration using a Local Agent
+
+        A Local Agent enables IT personnel to configure Intel AMT out-of-the-box
+        without requiring installing additional data to enable setup. The remote
+        configuration process may involve an ISV-developed remote configuration
+        agent that runs on the host.
+        For more information:
+        `<http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide>`_
+        Under "Setup and Configuration of Intel AMT" =>
+        "SDK Tools Supporting Setup and Configuration" =>
+        "Using the Local Agent Sample"
+
+        An open source Intel AMT configuration utility,	implementing a local agent
+        that accesses the Intel MEI driver, can be found here:
+        `<http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/download-the-latest-intel-amt-open-source-drivers/>`
+
+
+Intel AMT OS Health Watchdog
+============================
+
+The Intel AMT Watchdog is an OS Health (Hang/Crash) watchdog.
+Whenever the OS hangs or crashes, Intel AMT will send an event
+to any subscriber to this event. This mechanism means that
+IT knows when a platform crashes even when there is a hard failure on the host.
+
+The Intel AMT Watchdog is composed of two parts:
+        1) Firmware feature - receives the heartbeats
+           and sends an event when the heartbeats stop.
+        2) Intel MEI iAMT watchdog driver - connects to the watchdog feature,
+           configures the watchdog and sends the heartbeats.
+
+The Intel iAMT watchdog MEI driver uses the kernel watchdog API to configure
+the Intel AMT Watchdog and to send heartbeats to it. The default timeout of the
+watchdog is 120 seconds.
+
+If the Intel AMT is not enabled in the firmware then the watchdog client won't enumerate
+on the me client bus and watchdog devices won't be exposed.

-Intel(R) Management Engine Interface (Intel(R) MEI)
-===================================================
-
-Introduction
-============
-
-The Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) is an isolated and protected computing
-resource (Co-processor) residing inside certain Intel chipsets. The Intel ME
-provides support for computer/IT management features. The feature set
-depends on the Intel chipset SKU.
-
-The Intel Management Engine Interface (Intel MEI, previously known as HECI)
-is the interface between the Host and Intel ME. This interface is exposed
-to the host as a PCI device. The Intel MEI Driver is in charge of the
-communication channel between a host application and the Intel ME feature.
-
-Each Intel ME feature (Intel ME Client) is addressed by a GUID/UUID and
-each client has its own protocol. The protocol is message-based with a
-header and payload up to 512 bytes.
-
-Prominent usage of the Intel ME Interface is to communicate with Intel(R)
-Active Management Technology (Intel AMT) implemented in firmware running on
-the Intel ME.
-
-Intel AMT provides the ability to manage a host remotely out-of-band (OOB)
-even when the operating system running on the host processor has crashed or
-is in a sleep state.
-
-Some examples of Intel AMT usage are:
-   - Monitoring hardware state and platform components
-   - Remote power off/on (useful for green computing or overnight IT
-     maintenance)
-   - OS updates
-   - Storage of useful platform information such as software assets
-   - Built-in hardware KVM
-   - Selective network isolation of Ethernet and IP protocol flows based
-     on policies set by a remote management console
-   - IDE device redirection from remote management console
-
-Intel AMT (OOB) communication is based on SOAP (deprecated
-starting with Release 6.0) over HTTP/S or WS-Management protocol over
-HTTP/S that are received from a remote management console application.
-
-For more information about Intel AMT:
-http://software.intel.com/sites/manageability/AMT_Implementation_and_Reference_Guide
-
-
-Intel MEI Driver
-================
-
-The driver exposes a misc device called /dev/mei.
-
-An application maintains communication with an Intel ME feature while
-/dev/mei is open. The binding to a specific feature is performed by calling
-MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT_IOCTL, which passes the desired UUID.
-The number of instances of an Intel ME feature that can be opened
-at the same time depends on the Intel ME feature, but most of the
-features allow only a single instance.
-
-The Intel AMT Host Interface (Intel AMTHI) feature supports multiple
-simultaneous user connected applications. The Intel MEI driver
-handles this internally by maintaining request queues for the applications.
-
-The driver is transparent to data that are passed between firmware feature
-and host application.
-
-Because some of the Intel ME features can change the system
-configuration, the driver by default allows only a privileged
-user to access it.
-
-A code snippet for an application communicating with Intel AMTHI client:
-
-	struct mei_connect_client_data data;
-	fd = open(MEI_DEVICE);
-
-	data.d.in_client_uuid = AMTHI_UUID;
-
-	ioctl(fd, IOCTL_MEI_CONNECT_CLIENT, &data);
-
-	printf("Ver=%d, MaxLen=%ld\n",
-			data.d.in_client_uuid.protocol_version,
-			data.d.in_client_uuid.max_msg_length);
-
-	[...]
-
-	write(fd, amthi_req_data, amthi_req_data_len);
-
-	[...]
-
-	read(fd, &amthi_res_data, amthi_res_data_len);
-
-	[...]
-	close(fd);
-
-
-IOCTL

-        requests up to bytes 2k and received responses up to 2k bytes).
-
-	IOCTL_MEI_NOTIFY_SET: enable or disable event notifications
-
-	Usage:
-		uint32_t enable;
-		ioctl(fd, IOCTL_MEI_NOTIFY_SET, &enable);
-
-	Inputs:
-		uint32_t enable = 1;
-		or
-		uint32_t enable[disable] = 0;
-
-	Error returns:
-		EINVAL	Wrong IOCTL Number
-		ENODEV	Device  is not initialized or the client not connected
-		ENOMEM	Unable to allocate memory to client internal data.
-		EFAULT	Fatal Error (e.g. Unable to access user input data)

-
-	Notes:
-	The client must be connected in order to enable notification events
-
-
-	IOCTL_MEI_NOTIFY_GET : retrieve event
-
-	Usage:
-		uint32_t event;
-		ioctl(fd, IOCTL_MEI_NOTIFY_GET, &event);
-
-	Outputs:
-		1 - if an event is pending
-		0 - if there is no even pending
-
-	Error returns:
-		EINVAL	Wrong IOCTL Number
-		ENODEV	Device is not initialized or the client not connected
-		ENOMEM	Unable to allocate memory to client internal data.
-		EFAULT	Fatal Error (e.g. Unable to access user input data)
