Hello Peter,

Do you have any comments on the clk/emc bits? It looks to me that this
series basically needs yours, Stephen's and Rob's acks, after which
Thierry could pick it up once everything is arranged. Stephen and Rob
already made some comments to the previous versions of the series that
hopefully are addressed now. Maybe you also have something to say?
Otherwise just an ack will be also very appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Actually just noticed that I accidentally missed to CC Stephen directly
for this series, but hopefully it's not a problem since he is reading
the CLK ML. Stephen, please let me know otherwise, I could re-send it
all if needed.
