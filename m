My brain is already wreckaged by staring into futex code for several days
in a row. So it might be just me, but the above qualifies for 'word
salad' as Peter Zijlstra named a similar changelog.

Please try to explain problems in very clear and understandable ways. The
futex code is confusing enough already.

A bit less terse explanations might make the reader actually understand
right away what you are trying to say.

You're describing the WHAT, not the WHY.

Storing that value is meaningless as it is subject to change right after
the requeue operation has finished.

Also there is absolutely no requirement for this address to be accessible
at the time of this call. At least not for CMP_REQUEUE, CMP_REQUEUE_PI is a
different case.

I can halfways understand the chunks below this, but the above is
absolutely unclear why this needs to be reshuffled. There is no explanation
whatsoever why that code needs to be changed to achive the below.

This changes the code flow massively and there is absolutely no indication
why this is equivivalent to the previous state.

If at all, and I doubt it, this restructuring wants to be a separate patch.

So you go great length to "fix" the spurious wakeup case, but what happens if
there is an actual signal?

It will return to handle the signal and then run into the exactly same
situation because it restarts the syscall with the original uaddr1/uval,
right?

That means that the shortcut which was added in commit d58e6576b0de
("futex: Handle spurious wake up") is equivalent to the actual signal case.

So the above churn is pretty pointless because it "fixes" not even half of
the problem and you can't fix the -ERESTARTSYS case at all.

IIRC the uaddr1 value is supposed to change on a requeue operation so that
a late incoming waiter goes back with -EWOULDBLOCK. And excatly the same
would happen on the retry.

Aside of that you are completely failing to explain in which context you
observe this problem. Is that failing on libc, some test case or some other
maybe experimental code?

If there is an actual use case for keeping the uaddr1 value the same across
a requeue then this needs to be described properly and also needs to be
handled differently and consistently in all cases not just for a spurious
wakeup.

But let's talk about that once you came up with a proper explanation for
what you are trying to solve and why you think it's correct.
