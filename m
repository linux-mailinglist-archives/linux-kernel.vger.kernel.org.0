I got confused by that as well but it's not just prefer_sibling actually;
there are cases where we enter the group_has_spare but none of its
nested if blocks, so we fall through to out_spare.

I think it's better to hinge the cutoff on the busiest->sum_nr_running than
on busiest->idle_cpus. If you're balancing between big NUMA groups, you
could end up with a busiest->group_type == group_has_spare despite having
*some* of its CPUs overloaded (but still with
sg->sum_nr_running > sg->group_weight; simply because there's tons of CPUs).
