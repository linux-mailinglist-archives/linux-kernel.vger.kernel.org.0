Hurmph. there's something there, but the above is hard to read.

drain_pebs() is called from:

 - handle_pmi_common()		-- sample context
 - intel_pmu_pebs_sched_task()  -- non sample context
 - intel_pmu_pebs_disable()     -- non sample context
 - intel_pmu_auto_reload_read() -- possible sample context

So the question is what to do for PERF_SAMPLE_READ + PERF_FORMAT_GROUP.

I don't think throttling there is right either, but that does mean the
simple in_nmi() test you use is wrong.

Perhaps we can do something with how intel_pmu_drain_pebs_buffer()
passes in dummy regs pointer to distinguish between the sample and non
sample context.

Maybe write it like so?
