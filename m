Hi Jason,

I just noticed this email. I know it's a late response, but since you
Cc'd LKML, I figured I would respond anyway, and at least have an
answer in the archives ;-)

Yeah, I hated that above, but the format didn't have a good way to show
the overwrite without breaking existing tools :-/

The way the kernel uses that number is that the first 20 bits are the
size. Then we have an internal counter (top 12 bits) used for
synchronizing when the trace crosses pages. But these internal numbers
will never be exposed when it is sent off to the reader. Hence, those
bits are meaningless.

Now I probably could make the trace-cmd header just use those 20 bits,
as they never will be used for the size. When I wrote that, I just made
sure that the flags that are added to the page by the reader code was
not set. Which is why there is a discrepancy between the two masks.

Thanks for pointing this out. Again, the reason for the difference is
that they were created from two different perspectives. One was that it
would use the top 12 bytes for internal purposes, the other was just to
allow for up to 5 flags by the reader.

Does that make sense?
