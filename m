Given that adjust_numa_imbalance takes the imbalance as the first
parameter, not a boolean and it's not unconditionally true, I don't
get what you mean. Can you propose a patch on top of the entire series
explaining what you suggest please?

It's somewhat codified by the general comment "Would movement cause an
imbalance?". The hint is that any change in the NUMA balancer should check
whether it is in conflict with the load balancer. Being specific runs the
risk that the comment gets stale which may be dangerously misleading if
it's later wrong and a developer trusts the comment instead of checking the
code. Generally I do try to explain fully what is happening in comments but
this is a case where I really want developers to check the load balancer
code if they are updating the NUMA balancer.

I can update the changelog if there is a v4 release, right now there are
no substantial changes suggested by review. That may change depending on
other review feedback and what you think the call to adjust_numa_imbalance
should look like. Also bear in mind that the changelog wil become stale
if/when adjust_numa_imbalance is altered to allow a small imbalance between
NUMA nodes. While I plan to do that, this series should be finalised first.
