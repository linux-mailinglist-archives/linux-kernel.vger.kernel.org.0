I lost all the memory about it. :)
Anyway, how about this?

1. make node_present_pages() safer
static inline node_present_pages(nid)
{
if (!node_online(nid)) return 0;
return (NODE_DATA(nid)->node_present_pages);
}

2. make node_to_mem_node() safer for all cases
In ppc arch's mem_topology_setup(void)
for_each_present_cpu(cpu) {
 numa_setup_cpu(cpu);
 mem_node =3D node_to_mem_node(numa_mem_id());
 if (!node_present_pages(mem_node)) {
  _node_numa_mem_[numa_mem_id()] =3D first_online_node;
 }
}

With these two changes, we can uses node_present_pages() and node_to_mem_no=
de()
as intended.

Thanks.
