arm_cpuidle_get_ops in arch/arm/kernel/cpuidle.c checks the method, has
to match "psci" for drivers/firmware/psci.c to work on arm32

Not that I am aware of. But Linux uses it on arm32, so it's not entirely
unused.

Yes, it's used on arm32 as mentioned above.

I understand, scheme should fix it. This is not just restricted to this,
it's generic DT problem. So let's hope we get schema based validation soon.

Not entirely true. We have quite a lot of bindings that are added just
because downstream drivers use e.g. GPU and even standard ePAPR or DT
specification has lots of bindings which OS like Linux may choose
not to use at all. Same applies to ACPI, so I am not for removing bindings
just because there are no users in Linux.
