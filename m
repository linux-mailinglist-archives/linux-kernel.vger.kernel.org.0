fifo is just an example to demonstrate the simplest usage model
and evaluate the feature using basic shell environment.

Our use case is to fork/exec perf binary from a controlling c++ process
and the process creates, duplicates and passes open fds' numbers into
the forked perf process using --ctl-fd, --ctl-fd-ack command line arguments.

The patch set allows omitting ack fd on the command line and in this case
perf tool will just receive and process commands from ctl fd without confirmation.
So it will also work without specifying --ctl-fd-ack option like this:

#!/bin/bash

ctl_dir=/tmp/

ctl_fifo=${ctl_dir}perf_ctl.fifo
test -p ${ctl_fifo} && unlink ${ctl_fifo}
mkfifo ${ctl_fifo} && exec {ctl_fd}<>${ctl_fifo}

perf stat -D -1 -e cpu-cycles -a -I 1000 --ctl-fd ${ctl_fd} -- sleep 40 &
perf_pid=$!

sleep 5  && echo 'r' >&${ctl_fd} && read -u ${ctl_fd_ack} r1 && echo "resumed(${r1})"
sleep 10 && echo 'p' >&${ctl_fd} && read -u ${ctl_fd_ack} p1 && echo "paused(${p1})"

exec {ctl_fd}>&- && unlink ${ctl_fifo}

wait -n ${perf_pid}
exit $?

> unix socket be better maybe? and do we really need that ack fd?

Tool reads from already open fd whose number is provided via --ctl-fd option.
Controlling process can create, open or pass objects of various types 
(anon pipe, fifo, unix or TCP socket, something else) as fds in the forked
perf process so unix sockets are likely already supported too.

For our use case ack fd is really required to make sure counters are really 
paused, resumed and synchronize in the controlling process on changed counters
state otherwise there will be races in the process's code.

Mentioned use cases and design approaches do make sense and have been
considered prior the patch set implementation. These use cases can be 
supported on demand on top of the changes provided by the patch set.
Extending stat and record modes with a pair of open fd numbers and its
processing is currently enough for our use cases.

Alexey
