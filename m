Well, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. I was thinking that one should attem=

understand the code on the screen, and that's generally best--but here, may=
be
"data_race" is just something that means "tool cruft", really. So mentally =
we
would move toward visually filtering out the data_race "key word".

I really don't like it but at least there is a significant benefit from the=
 tool
that probably makes it worth the visual noise.

Blue sky thoughts for The Far Future: It would be nice if the tools got a l=
ot
better--maybe in the direction of C language extensions, even if only used =
in
this project at first.

thanks,
