It's not ATF itself I'm concerned about, but arbitrary Secure EL1 
payloads. In theory, a TEE might want to do something like cycle keys or 
log events in a TPM (or just encrypted in an external SPI flash), or 
scrub secure DRAM for cold boot protection. I'm pretty sure none of us 
are running such a thing on our boards today, but an upstream solution 
really wants to be robust for the general case.

Sure - I do like your cool idea of using a custom reboot reason to 
handle a 'trusted' poweroff in the U-Boot SPL - but in the meantime 
anything would be a practical improvement over the current situation. I 
reckon this other patch[1] (this seems to be a popular issue all of a 
sudden!) looks like the neatest interim step.

Robin.
