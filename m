Thank you for your review. I already knew Vanya's patch,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/11/151, and this patch didn't work for
me. I also couldn't agree on some points like memory allocating inside
the ACPI walker and changing many parts of TPM driver. I would like to
support AMD's fTPM with the smallest changes since this is a
workaround as you know.

I didn't understand clearly what your point is. Do you want me to
change my patches structurally like Vanya's patch and make patch v3?
or want me to give some advice to Vanya?
