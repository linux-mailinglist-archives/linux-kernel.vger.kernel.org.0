+1 on this approach. We already have that for 3d modes, another client cap
for "modes bigger than max fb" sounds like a good idea.

For "max plane size" I'm leaning towards drivers should virtualize at
least the primary plane if that's needed to scan out the biggest
resolution. Since there's way too much userspace which will simply not
work otherwise (iirc that's what a bunch of dual-pipe dsi drivers did).

I did:

commit 26b1d3b527e7bf3e24b814d617866ac5199ce68d
Author: Daniel Vetter <daniel.vetter@ffwll.ch>

    drm/atomic: Take the atomic toys away from X
