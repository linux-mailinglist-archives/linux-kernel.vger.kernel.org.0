Hey,

Sorry for the delay.

I tested your patch and it does work. Do you want me to send your change
as a full patch? Can I add your signed-off-by?

I would argue that the check for state in nvme_scan_work() without a
lock is racy and confusing. There's nothing to prevent the state from
changing immediately after the check.

Yes, I feel your patch is a good solution on it's own merits.

Yes. If you connect to and then immediately disconnect from a target (at
least with nvme-loop) you will reliably trigger this bug -- or one of
the others I've sent patches for.

Ah, right, my mistake.
