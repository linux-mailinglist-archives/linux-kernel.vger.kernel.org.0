Hi Mukesh,

In future *please* reply in plaintext rather than HTML.

That depends on what branch you're using as a base. My arm64/kcsan
branch worked for me as-is, but as I mentioned that was /very/ noisy.
Both the kcsan code and the arm64 code have moved on since then, and I
have no idea how well that would backport.

I had a quick go at porting my arm64 patch atop the kcsan branch in
Paul's tree, and that doesn't get as far as producing earlycon output,
so more work will be necessary to investigate and debug that.

I hope to look at that, but I don't think I'll have the chance to do so
before the end of next week.

There were a number of patches from Andrew Murray reworking the arm64
atomic implementation. See:

$ git log v5.3..v5.4-rc1 --author='Andrew Murray' -- arch/arm64

With those patches applied, my change to arch/arm64/lib/Makefile is
unnecessary and can be dropped.

Thanks,
Mark.
