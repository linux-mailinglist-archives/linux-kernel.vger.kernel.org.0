Just tried reverting, and found a bug if done in the reverted way. Sent you
email with a proposed change which is essentially the top of tree:
https://github.com/joelagnel/linux-kernel/commits/rcu/nohz-test-3

Also for Frederick, I wanted to mention why my pure hack above (dnn variable)
seemed to work. The reason was because of long to int conversion of
rdp->dynticks_nmi_nesting which I surprisingly did not get a compiler warning
for. dynticks_nmi_nesting getting converted to int was truncating the
DYNTICK_IRQ_NONIDLE bit (in fact I believe this was due to the cltq
instruction in x86). This caused the "else if" condition to always evaluate
to true and turn off the tick.

Paul, I wanted to see if I can create a repeatable test case for this issue.
Not a full blown RCU torture test, but something that one could run and get a
PASS or FAIL. Do you think this could be useful? And what is the best place
for such a test?
Essentially the test would be:
1. Run a test and dump some traces.
2. Parse the traces and see if things are sane (such as the tick not turning
   off for this issue).
3. Report pass or fail.

The other way instead of parsing traces could be, a kernel module that does
trace_probe_register on various tracepoints and tries to see if the tick
indeed could stay turned on. Then report pass/fail at the end of the module's
execution.

thanks,

 - Joel
