We have been through this so many times, but I dont think, we ever
understood each other.   I have a fundamental question, the answer to
which was never clear. Here it is...

If the hypervisor (hardware for hw virtio devices) does not mandate a
DMA API, why is it illegal for the driver to request, special handling
of its i/o buffers? Why are we associating this special handling to
always mean, some DMA address translation? Can't there be 
any other kind of special handling needs, that has nothing to do with
DMA address translation?
