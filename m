My point was that rq->lock isn't actually helping, because rq->rd could have
changed before rq->lock is acquired (and it's still the old rd that needs
the bandwidth subtraction).  cpuset_mutex/cpuset_rwsem helps somewhat,
though there's still a problem due to the subtraction not happening until
the task is woken up (by which time cpuset_mutex may have been released and
further reconfiguration could have happened).  This would be an issue even
without lazy migrate, since in that case ->set_cpus_allowed() can get
deferred, but this patch makes the window much bigger.

The right solution is probably to explicitly track the rd for which a task
has a pending bandwidth subtraction (if any), and to continue doing it from
set_cpus_allowed() if the task is not migrate-disabled.  In the meantime, I
think we should drop this patch from the patchset -- without it, lazy
migrate disable doesn't really make the race situation any worse than it
already was.

BTW, what happens to the bw addition in dl_task_can_attach() if a subsequent
can_attach fails and the whole operation is cancelled?
