tmpfs is basically a (complicated) frontend for alloc pages as far
as page allocation is concerned.

And those use the same backend?

Eww.  Please talk to the iommu list before starting on that.

So back to the question, I'd like to understand your use case (and
maybe hear from the other drm folks if that is common):

 - you allocate pages from shmem (why shmem, btw?  if this is done by
   other drm drivers how do they guarantee addressability without an
   iommu?)
 - then the memory is either mapped to userspace or vmapped (or even
   both, althrough the lack of aliasing you mentioned would speak
   against it) as writecombine (aka arm v6+ normal uncached).  Does
   the mapping live on until the memory is freed?
 - as you mention swapping - how do you guarantee there are no
   aliases in the kernel direct mapping after the page has been swapped
   in?
 - then the memory is potentially mapped to the iommu.  Is it using
   a long-living mapping, or does get unmapped/remapped repeatedly?
