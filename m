That does improve the behavior from the command line; it seems that
sphinx-build is indeed writing to stderr.  BUT that still doesn't fix the
docs build!  To get the option to take effect, I also have to explicitly
export SPHINXOPTS.  So the winning combination is:

  export SPHINXOPTS = $(shell perl -e 'open IN,"sphinx-build --version
  2>&1 |"; while (<IN>) { if (m/([\d\.]+)/) { print "-jauto" if ($$1 >= "1.7") } ;} close IN')

I don't have any weird version of make, so I'm not sure why you see
different results than I do here.

I can apply those tweaks to your patch if it's OK with you.

Interestingly, I would appear to have both versions installed, with
python2 winning in $PATH.
