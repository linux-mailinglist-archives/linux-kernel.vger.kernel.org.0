I think you're talking about creating a coordination interface
that allows multiple drivers to interact with a WWAN device,
which might implement several independent features.

I want to withdraw this notion of a "WWAN netdevice"...

Right, I get that now.

I'm talking about a way to experiment with new functionality in a
way that's explicitly not part of the interface.  But doing that
isn't necessary and it's probably not a good idea anyway.

OK cool then we have some common needs.   Let's get this defined so
we can use it for both!
