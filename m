This is because of remaining #ifdeffery in include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h:

#ifdef CC_USING_PATCHABLE_FUNCTION_ENTRY
#define MCOUNT_REC()    . = ALIGN(8);                           \
                        __start_mcount_loc = .;                 \
                        KEEP(*(__patchable_function_entries))   \
                        __stop_mcount_loc = .;
#else
#define MCOUNT_REC()    . = ALIGN(8);                           \
                        __start_mcount_loc = .;                 \
                        KEEP(*(__mcount_loc))                   \
                        __stop_mcount_loc = .;
#endif

Maybe you want to tackle that as well? I suggest to have at least one
FTRACE_CALLSITE_SECTION definition without double quotes. Alternatively, my
earlier solution just kept both sections, in case either one or both are
present.

                        KEEP(*(__patchable_function_entries))   \
                        KEEP(*(__mcount_loc))                   \
