Sound Open Firmware (SOF) [1]. You can build your own audio firmware for 
Broadwell and the driver is supported in the mainline (you'd need to 
disable the legacy driver [2]).

I can't think of any changes to that haswell/broadwell legacy driver, 
apart from Takashi's buffer management changes 3f93b1ed4ac1e2.

But there were multiple changes to the ASoC core, so it's possible that 
they impact suspend/resume. Just a blind guess.
