Ah yes, I remember those discussions. :)

One thing that has changed since we tried to implement this last was
the workqueue concurrency code. We don't have to worry about a single
thread or fixed threads per cgroup, because the workqueue code has
improved significantly to handle concurrency demands, and having one
work item per cgroup makes sure we have anywhere between 0 threads and
one thread per cgroup doing this reclaim work, completely on-demand.

Also, with cgroup2, memory and cpu always have overlapping control
domains, so the question who to account the work to becomes a much
easier one to answer.

The idea is not necessarily that the background reclaimer is lower
priority work, but that it can execute in parallel on a separate CPU
instead of being forced into the execution stream of the main work.

So we should be able to fully resolve this problem inside the kernel,
without going through userspace, by accounting CPU cycles used by the
background reclaim worker to the cgroup that is being reclaimed.

Yeah, I think it would be a pretty drastic expansion of the memory
controller's interface.
