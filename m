Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: Replace GPL boilerplate with SPDX identifiers
Date:   Wed, 28 Aug 2019 08:07:37 +0200
Message-Id: <20190828060737.32531-1-thuth@redhat.com>
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.84 on 10.5.11.22
X-Greylist: Sender IP whitelisted, not delayed by milter-greylist-4.6.2 (mx1.redhat.com [10.5.110.68]); Wed, 28 Aug 2019 06:07:45 +0000 (UTC)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The FSF does not reside in "675 Mass Ave, Cambridge" anymore...
let's simply use proper SPDX identifiers instead.
