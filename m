I assume it doesn't harm to explicitly mention that this rq.uclamp.max =
768 value comes from another task already enqueued on a cfs_rq of this
rq. This gives same substance to the term max-aggregated here.

s/feec()/find_energy_efficient_cpu() ?

This is also aligned with schedutil_cpu_util() (you do mention this in
the code later in this patch.
