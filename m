Well, while I do see those points I am not really sure they are worth
having a broken (by-definition) interface.

Is anybody really using that?

Yeah, but you could be already pessimistic and try movable zones before
other kernel zones.

I would argue that the whole interface is broken ;). Not the first time
in the kernel development history and not the last time either. What I
am trying to say here is that unless there are _real_ usecases depending
on knowing that something surely is _not_ offlineable then I would just
try to drop the functionality while preserving the interface and see
what happens.
