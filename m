in reset-lantiq.c, we split each reset request /status pair into one 
reset controller.

Each reset controller handles up to 32 resets. It will create up to 9 
even more

reset controllers in the new SoCs. In reality, there is only one RCU 
controller for all

SoCs. These designs worked but did not follow what hardware implemented.

After checking the existing code and referring to other implementation, 
we decided to

use register offset + bit position method. It can support all SoCs with 
this methods

without code change(device tree change only).

ok. but not sure why we need to reset bit 31 and 29. global softwre 
reset is bit 30.

Yes. We call software managed reset. callers call assert, deassert and delay

duration according to their specific requirement.

Yes, this is called hardware reset. We can't control reset duration.

New SoCs have removed support for hardware reset after software's feedback.

Old SoCs such as VRX200/ARX300 has both software/hardware resets

It means migration will be very easy:)

Our internal version supports XRX350/XRX500/PRX300(MIPS based) and

latest Lighting Mountain(X86 based). Migration to reset-intel-syscon.c

should be straight forward.
