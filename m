I'm sorry about that. I would like to invite Matthew Garrett and
discuss ACPI NVS and command/response buffer mapping again. So, I want
to summarize my test result and explain my opinion on that. I think
the data and result are important to make a decision clearly.
According to my test results, it seems that intersects between ACPI
NVS and command/response buffers will not make a problem.

Additionally, according to Dave's test results, this patch series can
cover not only an intersection with ACPI NVS area but also an
intersection with the reserved area. Here is the link,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/3/481 . Considering these results, my
patch series can solve AMD's fTPM problems.

Matthew,
what do you think about test results and this patch? In my view, if
the command/response buffers are in ACPI NVS area, saving and
restoring the buffers are ok and couldn't break anything.
I would like to get some feedback from you.

Seunghun
