Maybe I misunderstood what you mean above, I though you mean messing
with page cachability attributes for userspace pages.  If what you are
looking into is just "standard" SVM I only hope that our APIs for that
which currently are a mess are in shape by then, as all users currently
have their own crufty and at least slightly buggy versions of that.  But
at least it is an issue that is being worked on.

Yes,  but at that point the swapping can use the kernel linear mapping
and we are going into aliasing problems that can disturb the cache.  So
as-is this is going to problematic without new hooks into shmemfs.

Well, the point was that starting from v6 the kernels dma uncached
really is write combine.  So that applied to v7 and v8 as well.
