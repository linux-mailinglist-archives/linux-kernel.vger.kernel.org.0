Hi, Jerome

Thanks for your suggestion

Yes, we understand it is not easy for a new framework.
There are discussions in rfc2 (2018/9) and rfc3 (2018/11).
To make life easier, we plan to move the uacce to driver/misc to support 
our own product first until it is mature.
Using uacce, Currently we get quite a big performance improvement in our 
crypto product, like zip, hpre, sec.
Our final goal is "A General Accelerator Framework", which maybe ambitious.
So uacce is designed to be a common framework, can be easily supporting 
more accelerators.
And we are happy to get more requirements and make it mature.

Another good point is SVA support in ongoing, http://jpbrucker.net/sva/
After sva mature, the accelerators support will be much easier.

Thanks
