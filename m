I don't know about the default computed value ... we don't seem to have
any protection against the user setting min_free_kbytes to double the
amount of memory in the machine today.  Which would presumably cause
problems if I asked to maintain 32GB free at all times on my 16GB laptop?

Maybe we should have such protection?

True!
