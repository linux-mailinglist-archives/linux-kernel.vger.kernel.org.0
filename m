cfg_probe is where Bjorn's patch is preserving the SMMU state.  So I
think that should ensure device_reset() preserves the configuration..
or at least if something is missing, that seems fixable.

I suppose if the stream-match state and bootloader chosen context bank
is preserved, then keeping it direct-mapped would avoid things
starting to fault before display driver is probed.  That plus some
solution for GPU default domain would narrow the scope of what I need
to just avoiding getting iommu dma_ops installed.

Perhaps I'm not looking in the right place, but the extent of what I
could find about RMRR tables was:

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/MdePkg/Include/IndustryStandard/DmaRemappingReportingTable.h#L122

I couldn't really see how that specifies the device.  But entirely
possible that I'm not seeing the whole picture.

I am a bit curious about how windows handles this, since they must
have the same problem on these laptops.

That doesn't seem like a bad outcome ;-)
