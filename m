You mean kfree_bulk() instead of kfree_batch() right? I agree with you, would
be nice to do per-slab optimization in the future.

Also, I am thinking that whenever we do per-slab optimization, then the
kmem_cache_free_bulk() can be optimized further. If all pointers are on the
same slab, then we can just do virt_to_cache on the first pointer and avoid
repeated virt_to_cache() calls. That might also give a benefit -- but I could
be missing something.

Right now kmem_cache_free_bulk() just looks like a kmem_cache_free() in a
loop except the small benefit of not disabling/enabling IRQs across each
__cache_free, and the reduced cache miss benefit of using the array.

thanks,
