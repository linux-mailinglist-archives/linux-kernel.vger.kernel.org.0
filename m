Hi Lakshmi,

Janne Karhunen is defining an IMA workqueue in order to more
frequently update the on disk security xattrs.  The Subject line on
this patch needs to be more explicit (eg. define workqueue for early
boot "key" measurements).

Keys created or updated before a custom policy is loaded are currently
not measured.

I'm not sure why you want to differentiate between IMA being
initialized vs. an empty policy.  I would think you would want to know
when a custom policy has been loaded.

Until ima_update_policy() is called, "ima_rules" points to the
architecture specific and configured policy rules, which are
persistent, and the builtin policy rules.  Once a custom policy is
loaded, "ima_rules" points to the architecture specific, configured,
and custom policy rules.

I would define a function that determines whether or not a custom
policy has been loaded.

(I still need to review adding/removing from the queue.)

This "hunk" and subsequent one seem to be just a variable name change.
 It has nothing to do with queueing "key" measurements and shouldn't
be included in this patch.
