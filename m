Sure Marc, i kept you in Cc for V2 addressing stephen's comments.

Agree, we are not lossing it, but rather RFC v1 was keeping a requirement on drivers to keep wake

enabled by calling irq_set_wake when the interrupt is routed via PDC, even after coming out of suspend.

i addressed this in RFC v2.

This is not the case, we don't loose any interrupt in CPUidle.
