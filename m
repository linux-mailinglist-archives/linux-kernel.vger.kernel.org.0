Yeah I have thought and tried !env->sd->nr_balance_failed. In fact, I
have tried both and I haven't seen any visible difference in my tests.
Nevertheless, using !env->sd->nr_balance_failed condition doesn't let
a chance to the current running task with a possibly correct load to
become a waiting task during the next load balance and to be selected
instead of a larger task, which will create another imbalance. Also
cache_nice_tries increase the number of trials to large domain span to
select different rqs before migrating a large task. Then,
env->sd->nr_balance_failed <= env->sd->cache_nice_tries is used in
can_migrate() for preventing migration because of cache_hotness so we
are aligned with this condition. At the opposite,
!env->sd->nr_balance_failed is used with LB_MIN which is disable by
default.

TBH, I don't have a strong opinion between !env->sd->nr_balance_failed
and env->sd->nr_balance_failed <= env->sd->cache_nice_tries.
