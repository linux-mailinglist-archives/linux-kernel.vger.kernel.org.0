Hi Tim and Subhra,

This patchset seems to be interesting for my TurboSched patches as well
where I try to pack jitter tasks on fewer cores to get higher Turbo Frequencies.
Well, the problem I face is that we sometime end up putting multiple jitter tasks on a core
running some latency sensitive application which may see performance degradation.
So my plan was to classify such tasks to be latency sensitive thereby hinting the load
balancer to not put tasks on such cores.

AFAIU, the problem defined above intersects with my patches as well where the interface
is required to classify the jitter tasks. I have already tried few methods like
syscall and cgroup to classify such tasks and maybe something like that can be adopted
with these patchset as well.


Thanks,
