Adding power domain support for i.MX8MM/MN to the GPCv2 driver does not
prevent a SCMI solution to be used when available. I don't see why we
should block this.

This is how all hardware specific stuff is handled in the driver. I see
your use-case of having a single TF-A based driver for applications
where you have more than on OS running on the system. For the very
common case of only a single rich OS running on the system the code
reuse doesn't really matter and in fact it's easier to fix any bugs by
just updating the Linux kernel.

I would be very interested in the details here. What is the big
difference in the i.MX8MM that would make it hard to support it in the
GPCv2 driver in the same way as we did with i.MX8MQ?

You are still free to remove the GPC DT node, as soon as the SCMI
replacement is ready.

But if you decide to handle the GPC stuff in TF-A, are you also going
to handle the external supplies to the GPC domains in the TF-A? What
about synchronous reset clocks that need to be running while the domain
is powered up? Are you going to add a SCMI based replacement for the
clock controller, which is currently also handled in the rich OS?
