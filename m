It's not prohibitied, but it probably should be because no one really
tests it properly. I have a handful of IBM machines where I boot a
PREEMPT kernel but that's about it.

The corenet configs don't have PREEMPT enabled, which suggests it was
never really supported on those machines.

But maybe someone from NXP can tell me otherwise.
