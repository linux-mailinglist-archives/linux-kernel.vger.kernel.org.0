Why do you consider this a hack? 

 /* If the section is current section, it continues the loop */
	if (start_pfn == pfn)
		continue;

The comment explains that check is there to handle the exact scenario
that you are fixing in this patch. With subsection patch that check is
not sufficient. Shouldn't we just fix the check to handle that?

Not sure about your comment w.r.t find_{smalles,biggest}_section. We
search with pfn range outside the subsection we are trying to remove.
So this should not have an impact there?
