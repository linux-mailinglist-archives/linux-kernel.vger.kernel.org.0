ext4_dir_encryption_supported() was already changed to use the sysfs
file, and changing the upstart code to check the sysfs file does
indeed fix the problem for good. I'll do some more tests and push the
necessary changes into our code base if I don't hit some other issue.

Yes, indeed it seems as if that is unrelated.
