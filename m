Tested your patch on top of v5.2-rc4* on Arm TC2 (32bit) and CPU hotplug 
stress test. W/o your patch, the test fails within seconds since CPUs 
are not coming up again. W/ your patch, the test runs for hours just fine.

You can add my:

Tested-by: Dietmar Eggemann <dietmar.eggemann@arm.com>

* just for the record: one additional unrelated patch (to disable the 
NOR flash) is necessary on Arm TC2: 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10968391 .
