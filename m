I'm drawing a blank as far as easy ways forward, so I'm just going accept
the compiler word-level constraints as a "given". I was hoping maybe you
had some magic available, just checking. :)

So it looks like we're probably stuck with having to annotate the code. Giv=
en
that, there is a balance between how many macros, and how much commenting. =
For
example, if there is a single macro (data_race, for example), then we'll ne=
ed to
add comments for the various cases, explaining which data_race situation is=
=20
happening.

That's still true, but to a lesser extent if more macros are added. In this=
 case,
I suspect that READ_BITS() makes the commenting easier and shorter. So I'd =
tentatively
lead towards adding it, but what do others on the list think?
