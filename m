In my first version WAKE also took a size parameter, however I chose to no=
t send that version because there are two problems with that. You already =
noticed the first problem: we would have to store the size and verify that=
 it matches on WAKE.

The second problem is with REQUEUE and CMP_REQUEUE: The usual case there w=
ill be that you have a mutex that's 8 bits in size, but the condition vari=
able is harder to fit into 8 bits and will be larger. So you would need to=
 pass in two different size flags. But REQUEUE doesn't actually care what =
the size is at all. It just moves waiters around. CMP_REQUEUE does care, b=
ut only for one of the arguments. So it works out perfectly that there is =
one flag for the size.

Those two cases really helped me clarify what the size argument actually i=
s needed for. It's only needed for the "compare" part of CMP_REQUEUE. Simi=
larly WAIT could have also been named CMP_WAIT and if it was named that, i=
t would also be obvious that the size argument is only needed for the "com=
pare" part of WAIT. All the other work that WAIT does doesn't actually car=
e about the memory behind the pointer at all. It only cares about the addr=
ess.

That also illustrates what should happen if we splice a futex and call WAI=
T on @ptr and WAKE on @ptr+1: If I understand you correctly, (and correct =
me if I'm wrong here) your point is that there would be an inconsistency i=
n the API there. You say it would be inconsistent for a size-less WAKE to =
not wake a futex that it's pointing in the middle of.

But with the above thoughts, we realize that since those are two different=
 addresses, they refer to two different futexes. It doesn't matter that th=
e WAIT was for a four byte futex. That information was only relevant for t=
he "compare" part of WAIT. It's not relevant for anything else, and theref=
ore it's not relevant for the identity of the futex. So the fact that spli=
cing a futex doesn't work (and can't easily be made to work) does not poin=
t at an inconsistency in the API.

Taking all that into account, I believe there are two possible consistent =
implementations for sized futexes. One of them is the one you're asking fo=
r, where the size is always passed and always verified to be correct. The =
other one is the one I'm proposing, where the size argument only applies t=
o the "compare" part of WAIT and CMP_REQUEUE, and all the other work of fu=
texes is size-less and only works on the address. (and I think similar rea=
soning will work for the operations that are not supported yet)

I believe that between those two consistent implementations, the one with =
size-less WAKE and REQUEUE is preferable. REQUEUE in particular makes clea=
r how we really don't care about the size in these operations. There is no=
 difference in behavior when moving between futexes of different sizes or =
the same size. It just doesn't matter. But if REQUEUE is size-less, it wou=
ld be inconsistent for WAKE to require a size since REQUEUE is just a WAKE=
 with extra features.

The other downside of the version that checks the size is that we, well, h=
ave to check the size. That's extra work we have to do and extra data we h=
ave to store, and I can't come up with any case where a user would actuall=
y benefit from us doing that extra work.

All that being said I agree with your other comments (renaming FUTEX_NO_RE=
AD_WRITE to FUTEX_NONE, and introducing a futex_size() function to simplif=
y some of the code). I'll change the code and send a new patch.

Meanwhile let me know what you would like to do about passing a size to WA=
KE or not.
