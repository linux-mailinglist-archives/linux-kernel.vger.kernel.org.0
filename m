Hi, Boris,

I corrected the commit message per your comment. Except the commit
message, I didn't change anything else.

Now I send the updated patch here. Is the patch right now?
Should I send the patch to you in another thread?

Thanks.

Subject: [PATCH v3 3/3] x86/cpufeatures: Enumerate new AVX512 BFLOAT16
 instructions

AVX512 BFLOAT16 instructions support 16-bit BFLOAT16 floating-point
format (BF16) for deep learning optimization.

BF16 is a short version of 32-bit single-precision floating-point
format (FP32) and has several advantages over 16-bit half-precision
floating-point format (FP16). BF16 keeps FP32 accumulation after
multiplication without loss of precision, offers more than enough
range for deep learning training tasks, and doesn't need to handle
hardware exception.

AVX512 BFLOAT16 instructions can be enumerated by:
	CPUID.7.1:EAX[bit 5] AVX512_BF16

CPUID.7.1:EAX contains only feature bits. Re-define currently empty
word 12 as a pure features word to hold the feature bits including
AVV512_BF16.

Detailed information of the CPUID bit and AVX512 BFLOAT16 instructions
can be found in the latest Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions
and Future Features Programming Reference.
