From: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen@linux.intel.com>

Hardware companies like Intel have lots of information which they
want to disclose to some folks but not others.  Non-disclosure
agreements are a tool of choice for helping to ensure that the
flow of information is controlled.

But, they have caused problems in mitigation development.  It
can be hard for individual developers employed by companies to
figure out how they can participate, especially if their
employer is under an NDA.

To make this easier for developers, make it clear to disclosing
parties that they are expected to give permission for individuals
to participate in mitigation efforts.
