Metrics are really useful to collect with any other sampling event
to give you more context in the program behavior.

Yes. Any normal leader sampling case. You just collect metrics too.

That's too strong. You probably don't want minutes, but seconds
worth of measurement should be ok.

This happens when the internal counters that feed the metrics
overflow.

It has to be handled in the PMI.

You have to write them to reset the internal counters.
