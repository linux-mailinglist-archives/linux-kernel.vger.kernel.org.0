From: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen@linux.intel.com>

Both hardware companies and the kernel community prefer coordinated
disclosure to the alternatives.  It is also obvious that sitting on
ready-to-go mitigations for months is not so nice for kernel
maintainers.

I want to ensure that the patched text can not be read as "the kernel
does not wait for conference dates".  I'm also fairly sure that, so
far, we *have* waited for a number of conference dates.

Change the text to make it clear that waiting for conference dates
is possible, but keep the grumbling about it being a burden.

While I think this is good for everyone, this patch represents my
personal opinion and not that of my employer.
