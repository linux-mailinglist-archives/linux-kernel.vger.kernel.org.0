I'm open to suggestions :)
The point of using a different function was to avoid a huge patchset to=20
fix the 50+ drivers that use sched_clock_register().

Alright, I really didn't think it was that bad. Next time I'll use a=20
wrapper.

The fact that every other driver with the same problem decides to add a=20
workaround instead of a proper fix does not mean that the problem does=20
not exist.

My allergy of static storage is not worth the trouble of a treewide=20
pathset so I'll just drop this patch and send a v5.

Thanks,
