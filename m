I can reproduce it now.

perf record -e cycles:u ls
perf report --stdio

     75.29%  ls       ld-2.27.so        [.] do_lookup_x
     23.64%  ls       ld-2.27.so        [.] __GI___tunables_init
      1.04%  ls       [unknown]         [k] 0xffffffff85c01210
      0.03%  ls       ld-2.27.so        [.] _start

Looks it's caused by skid.

Thanks
Jin Yao
