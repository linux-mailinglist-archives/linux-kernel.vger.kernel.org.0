Subject: [PATCH 1/2] habanalabs: stop using the acronym KMD
Date:   Mon,  2 Sep 2019 10:50:23 +0300
Message-Id: <20190902075024.27302-1-oded.gabbay@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We want to stop using the acronym KMD. Therefore, replace all locations
(except for register names we can't modify) where KMD is written to other
terms such as "Linux kernel driver" or "Host kernel driver", etc.
