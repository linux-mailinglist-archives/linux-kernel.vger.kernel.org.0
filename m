Yes, it was fun.  My main BIOS contact has explained to me how they are
stuck between a rock and a hard place on any other options for this.

OK, is the phrase "kernel image" generally understood to cover
everything from _text to _end, including the bss?  As long as that's
true, I will adopt this phrase.

I'm intending to add something like this in the next version:

/*
 * Only the region occupied by the kernel image has so far been checked against
 * the table of usable memory regions provided by the firmware, so
 * invalidate pages outside that region.  A page table entry that maps to
 * a reserved area of memory would allow processor speculation into that
 * area, and on some hardware (particularly the UV platform) speculation
 * into reserved areas can cause a system halt.
 */

This fix works for our hardware because the problematic reserved
regions are 64M aligned, and going up to the next 2MB boundary from
_end is not going to cross the next 64M boundary.

One could argue the next step would be going into
boot/compressed/{kaslr.c, misc.c} and rounding the size of the kernel
up to the next 2MB boundary to ensure the chosen random location is
covered by usable RAM up to the next PMD-level boundary.  I did not go
there because for us it is not necessary.

> Is it in the lower 1MB, by chance?

No, this is a reserved range at the top physical addresses for each
NUMA node in a collection of them.

Because the range the kernel image is located in is already checked
against them in boot/compressed/kaslr.c.  This will now be explained
in the comment I mention above, which you had not yet seen.
