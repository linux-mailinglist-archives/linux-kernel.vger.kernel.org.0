the time slot register holds the time interval of Vout when enable the
each regulator.
fixed-on-time property is to specify each regulator shares same time
interval mention in time slot register.
variable on-time defines the factor or multiples of value in time slot
register.

1. if fixed-on-time is needed with default time slot register settings,
then time slot property is not needed
2. if variable time is needed with modified time slot, then both
variable time factor & time slot property is needed,
Hope above explanations answers the necessary of all the above property

the node regulators & sub-node of regulators are parsed (initdata) by
regulator framework during regulator registration,
so it would be redundant parsing all the node if mentioned under each
regulator node and this is optional. If you still not
convinced I will change.

Not sure did I understand your question correctly.
all the node name under regulators node are parsed by regulator
framework & validated against
name in regulator descriptors.
