I don't mind the generic interface I just find the use-case odd. So by
now rtmutex is used by i2c core and not a single driver like it the case
the last time I looked at it. But still, why is it (PI-boosting)
important for I2C to use it and not for other subsystems? Moving on…

Not really. I hacked "int sleeping_lock" into task_struct which is
incremented each time a "sleeping lock" version of rtmutex is requested.
We have two users as of now:
- RCU, which checks if we schedule() while holding rcu_read_lock() which
  is okay if it is a sleeping lock.

- NOHZ's pending softirq detection while going to idle. It is possible
  that "ksoftirqd" and "current" are blocked on locks and the CPU goes
  to idle (because nothing else is runnable) with pending softirqs.

I wanted to let rtmutex invoke another schedule() function in case of a
sleeping lock to avoid the RCU warning. This would avoid incrementing
"sleeping_lock" in the fast path. But then I had no idea what to do with
the NOHZ thing.

So, what does that mean for that patch. According to my inbox it has
applied to an "urgent" branch. Do I resubmit the whole thing or just a
comment on top?
