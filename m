I didn't comment earlier on S3 and my view is that it is horrible when
trying to deal with it from a security perspective. As a result I have
been driven to the belief that you cannot assume your security posture
is the same after S3 as it was before or that you even know what your
posture is. On Intel we have the SEXIT instruction to signal that we are
no longer in SMX which, in theory, blocks modification of DRTM PCRs.
Thus SEXIT should be called before S3 and then when you come back one
needs to then re-launch to get back to a known state of integrity.
