Hmm... sounds reasonable, however, the risk is obvious, if we mount with wrong
primary device, filesystem can be aware that with metadata sanity check, if we
mount with wrong secondary/... devices by mistake (or intentionally, people
may think filesystem should be aware illegal parameters....), filesystem won't
be aware of that, then metadata/data will be inconsistent...

Although that may also happen when we use tunesb.f2fs, but fsck.f2fs can be
followed to verify the modification of tunesb.f2fs, that would be much safer.

So I suggest we can do that in tools first, maybe implement nextdev mount option
if we have added metadata in secondary/... device.

Thanks,
