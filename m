One or more of you will have to volunteer to maintain the new subsystem.

There are lots of ways this can be structured, and once you have
a maintainer (team), they can decide how to do it, but I'm available
to come up with ideas here.

Generally speaking, you don't need a ton of abstraction. The
drivers/watchdog subsystem could serve as a template there.
This has both models, the old way in which each HW specific
driver uses its own chardev, and the new model in which the
common code sits in a library module, and individual drivers
register to it.

I think the amount of code for two drivers is roughly the same
in either model, but the shared user interface implementation
makes it easier to ensure that the interfaces are in fact
compatible.

The other thing your own framework can do is to provide some
consistency between BMC specific drivers for different
functionality.

Good idea. Yes, please.
