If there is a way to fetch event logs buffer at runtime from TPM
device then why should we rely on DT or ACPI stuff?

I guess you are missing the basic TEE bus view. It is an
auto-discoverable bus where TAs as devices are detected automatically.
It is similar to USB, PCI etc. busses. But in case of Platform, I2C,
SPI etc. which are NOT auto-discoverable busses, devices are described
in the hardware description language (ACPI or DT).

Like in case of TPM, when acting as an I2C based device is represented
via a DT node (see section: "2.4 Device population" in
Documentation/devicetree/usage-model.txt). And device specific
properties are retrieved from corresponding device DT node. But in
case of TPM being a TEE based device, detected automatically, you
won't have a device DT node to describe its properties but rather
those properties need to derived from the device automatically.

So in summary, it doesn't seems possible to support TEE devices
detected automatically and have properties described in DT unless you
hard code DT node path in the driver to provide those properties which
doesn't looks like a generic solution.

It's not a limitation but rather a feature of TEE devices being
auto-discoverable rather being described via DT or ACPI.
