In general, building interrupt controller drivers as a module is a
pretty difficult thing to do in a safe manner. As you found out, this
relies on the irq_domain being "emptied" before it can be freed. There
are some other gotchas in the rest of the IRQ stack as well.

Doing that is hard. One of the reasons is that the OF subsystem will
happily allocate all the interrupts it can even if there is no driver
having requested them (see of_platform_populate). This means that you
cannot track whether a client driver is using one of the interrupt your
irqchip is in charge of. You can apply some heuristics, but they are in
general all wrong.

Fixing the OF subsystem is possible, but will break a lot of platforms
that will have to be identified and fixed one by one.  Another
possibility would be to refcount irqdescs, and make sure the irqdomain
directly holds pointers to them. Doable, but may create overhead.

To sum it up, don't build your irqchip driver as a module if you can
avoid it. If you can't, you'll have to be very careful about how the
mapping is established (make sure it is not created by
of_platform_populate), and use irq_dispose_mapping in the client
drivers.

Hope this helps,
