This just means that we need to take care of nonincrementing registers
in there, we don't want to end up with too many different places where
we might have to handle formatting since that leads to duplication.
It's about marshalling for physical I/O, it's a bit misnamed at this
point but nonincrementing registers definitely fit in there for me.

Modify raw_write() to handle this instead, it is a mirror of the read
side it's just that writes are more complicated since there's more
things that could happen as you're discovering here.

Yes.

Push that into raw_write(), it just needs to special case when the first
register in a block is non-incrementing in the page selection logic (add
a !nonincrmenting in the while loop I think).
