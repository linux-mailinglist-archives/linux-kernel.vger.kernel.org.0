I've changed the setup example to:

  The target runqueue, rq:
    rq.cpu_capacity_orig = 512
    rq.cfs.avg.util_avg = 200
    rq.uclamp.max = 768 // the max p.uclamp.max of all enqueued p's is 768

  The waking task, p (not yet enqueued on rq):
    p.util_est = 600
    p.uclamp.max = 100


I'll also flesh out the rest.

That's what I imply with compute_energy() (which ends up calling
schedutil_cpu_util()).
