Right. We can use tagging idea to separate kmalloc/vmalloc pointers to
place them into different arrays. Because kvmalloc() can return either
SLAB pointer or vmalloc one.

We can do that. We can check it by calling is_vmalloc_addr() on ptr. 
So it is possible to differentiate.

Right you are. We can do that only after grace period is passed, 
after synchronize_rcu(). Good point :)

I like it. It would be more clean interface. Also there are places where
people do not embed the rcu_head into their stuctures for some reason
and do like:

    synchronize_rcu();
    kfree(p);
