This series follows up the discussion happened when reviewing "Make 
deferred split shrinker memcg aware".

David Rientjes suggested deferred split THP should be accounted into 
available memory since they would be shrunk when memory pressure comes 
in, just like MADV_FREE pages. For the discussion, please refer to: 
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg2010115.html

Yes, I agree. We may use a more specific name, i.e. DeferredSplitTHP.

Like deferred split THP and MADV_FREE pages, they could be reclaimed 
during memory pressure.

If you just go with "DeferredSplitTHP", these ambiguity would go away.
