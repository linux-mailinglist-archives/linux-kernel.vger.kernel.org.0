The difference is if I have the kaslr seed, I can calculate the kernel
base address.

In your case, you are feeding an RNG which continually has entropy
added to it. I can't see that knowing one piece of the entropy data is
a security hole. It looks more like you've just copied what what done
for kaslr-seed.

Still wondering on this question. Mapping it R/W would mean rng-seed
could be handled later and completely out of the arch code and so
could the zeroing of the kaslr-seed. Also, we generally assume the FDT
is modifiable for any fixups. This happens on arm32 and powerpc, but I
guess we haven't needed that yet on arm64.
