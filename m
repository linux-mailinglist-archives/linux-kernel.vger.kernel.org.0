[0]? That's broken. It needs to take the 'cache/index?/id' field, and not hard-code '3',
search each 'cache/index?/level' instead.


Documentation/x86/resctrl_ui.rst's "Cache IDs" section says:
| On current generation systems there is one L3 cache per socket and L2
| caches are generally just shared by the hyperthreads on a core, but this
| isn't an architectural requirement.
[...]
| So instead of using "socket" or "core" to define the set of logical cpus
| sharing a resource we use a "Cache ID"
[...]
| To find the ID for each logical CPU look in
| /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cache/index*/id

arch/x86/kernel/cpu/restrl/core.c:domain_add_cpu() pulls the domain-id out of struct
cacheinfo:
|	int id = get_cache_id(cpu, r->cache_level);

drivers/base/cacheinfo.c has some macro-foliage that exports this same field via sysfs,
and arch/x86/kernel/cpu/restrl/ctrlmondata.c:parse_line() matches that id against the
value user-space provides in the schemata.

(we've got some horrible code for arm64 to make this work without 'cache id' as a hardware
property!)

On x86 these numbers are of the order 0,1,2, so its very likely physical_package_id and
cache_id alias, and you get away with it.

I've come across:
https://github.com/intel/intel-cmt-cat/

but I've never even cloned it. The rdtset man page has:
| With --iface-os (-I) parameter, rdtset uses resctrl filesystem (/sys/fs/resctrl)
| instead of accessing MSRs directly.

At the moment its not as-documented or as the kernel is using those numbers.

I assume this is something that changed in resctrl when it was merged, and this selftest
tool just needs updating.


Thanks,

James
