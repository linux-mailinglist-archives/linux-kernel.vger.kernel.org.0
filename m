Understood.

Apparently... I need to check this more.

No, but maybe I wasn't clear enough. I'll give an overview:

For D06 SAS controller - which is a multi-queue PCI device - we use 
managed interrupts. The HW has 16 submission/completion queues, so for 
96 cores, we have an even spread of 6 CPUs assigned per queue; and this 
per-queue CPU mask is the interrupt affinity mask. So CPU0-5 would 
submit any IO on queue0, CPU6-11 on queue2, and so on. PCI NVMe is 
essentially the same.

These are the environments which we're trying to promote performance.

Then for D05 SAS controller - which is multi-queue platform device 
(mbigen) - we don't use managed interrupts. We still submit IO from any 
CPU, but we choose the queue to submit IO on a round-robin basis to 
promote some isolation, i.e. reduce inter-queue lock contention, so the 
queue chosen has nothing to do with the CPU.

And with your change we may submit on cpu4 but service the interrupt on 
cpu30, as an example. While previously we would always service on cpu0. 
The old way still isn't ideal, I'll admit.

For this env, we would just like to maintain the same performance. And 
it's here that we see the performance drop.

Right

Maybe...

  always. There must be something I'm missing.
