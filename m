Fair enough. However, in the XTS case you mention, I think it's easier
to remember that you set up XTS mode for your disk encryption and thus
that you should enable it in your config. By the way, the CRYPTO_AUTHENC
Kconfig help text only and specifically mentions IPsec, which can be a
lot confusing for people trying to find out what option of which they
got rid is actually causing an issue.

On top of that, there's no hint in kernel logs about a particular
algorithm, feature or Kconfig option that could be missing. Do we really
expect people simply tuning their kernel configuration to go and read
the source code to ensure they are not breaking their system?

As for your "most users do not use authenticated encryption" argument, I
agree, but note that cryptsetup with LUKS2 makes it quite easy to setup
authenticated disk encryption, and I bet more and more people are using
it. It's working most of the time because people are either using a
distro kernel with everything enabled, or compiling their own one but
being security-minded enough to use stuff like IPsec which then selects
CRYPTO_AUTHENC.

After reading all that, I'm wondering if this is not a good example of
where the "imply" keyword should be used.

Thanks for your hindsight,
