What newer release? LSDK-18.06-V4.14 is the latest -V4.14 tag at
https://github.com/qoriq-open-source/linux.git, and identical to the
linux-4.14 branch. And despite commit 4c33e2d0576b removing the PPC32
dependency from QUICC_ENGINE, it clearly hasn't been built on arm, since
back around v4.12, mainline's qe.c grew a call to pvr_version_is which
is ppc-only. So from that I sort of assumed that NXP had dropped trying
to support the LS1021A even in their own kernels.

In any case, we have zero interest in running an NXP kernel. Maybe I
should clarify what I meant by "based on commits from" above: We're
currently running a mainline 4.14 kernel on LS1021A, with a few patches
inspired from the NXP 4.1 branch applied on top - but also with some
manual fixes for e.g. the pvr_version_is() issue. Now we want to move
that to a 4.19-based kernel (so that it aligns with our MPC8309 platform).

Yes, as I said, I wanted to try a fresh approach since Zhao
Qiang's patches seemed to be getting nowhere. Splitting the patches into
smaller pieces is definitely part of that - for example, the completely
trivial whitespace fix in patch 1 is to make sure the later coccinelle
generated patch is precisely that (i.e., a later respin can just rerun
the coccinelle script, with zero manual fixups). I also want to avoid
mixing the ppcism cleanups with other things (e.g. replacing some
of_get_property() by of_property_read_u32()). And the "testing on ARM"
part comes once I get to actually building on ARM. But there's not much
point doing all that unless there's some indication that this can be
applied to some tree that actually feeds into Linus', which is why I
started with a few trivial patches and precisely to start this discussion.
