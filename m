Hi again,

Sorry for the delay, I'm currently traveling and only have access to a
rather weak machine so compiles took ages.

A few remarks regarding this patch;

This version is not fully identical to the previous invocation, as the
sort order differs a little, but I tried to get it as close to the
original as I was able to. Unfortunately no sort flag seems to quite
replicate tars sorting.

Some noteworthy details in this version are `./` in the find format string,=
 LC_ALL
for sort and --no-recursion;

The format string is in place to replicate the exact behaviour of the previ=
ous
invocation, which included a leading `./`. I don't mind dropping this,
if anyone feels strongly about it, but initially I set out to reproduce
the result as closely as possible.

LC_ALL=3DC is required as locale can impact sort order.

--no-recursion is required to prevent duplication in the resulting archive,
because both, folders and files, are already supplied from find and sort.

I checked this part of the script on an old debian lenny (5.0.10) system an=
d it
behaves as expected, except for xz support not being available in
the shipped gnu tar (v1.20).

As far as other testing goes, I have compiled 5.3.5 on NixOS with kheaders =
as a
module where both runs produced identical results.

Because of the limited computational power available to me right now, I
did not have time yet to try the baked-in version or any additional
compile runs. I would appreciate if reviewers could do a few runs too.

Andreas: Could you give this patch a try and see if this works for you?

Thanks and best regards,
