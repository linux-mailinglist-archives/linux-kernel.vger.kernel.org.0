I thought that regmap only allows mapping in MMIO regions for 
multiplexing access from multiple drivers or accessing registers outside 
the device HW registers, but you seem to need to manually generate the 
LPC bus accesses to access registers on the slave device.

If this FPGA is the only device which will ever be on this LPC bus, then 
could you encode the LPC accesses directly in the FPGA driver?

 > But then I saw the logic_pio stuff as well and now I'm not sure what 
the best approach would be anymore

Logic PIO is for IO Port accesses. It could serve your purpose, but you 
would need to use IO port accesses for your slave driver, like inb and outb.

As another alternative, it might be worth considering writing an I2C 
controller driver for your LPC host, i.e. model as an I2C bus, and have 
an I2C client driver for the LPC slave (FPGA). I think that there are 
examples of this in the kernel.

All the best,
john
