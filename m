"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/generic.txt" file already has dt-property named
maximum-speed, which fulfills current requirement. So to disable gen2 feature simply
add below entry to corresponding usb3 port entry.
		padctl@3520000 {
			status = "okay";

			ports {
				usb3-3 {
					maximum-speed = "super-speed";
				};
		};

Read the property using API usb_get_maximum_speed.
