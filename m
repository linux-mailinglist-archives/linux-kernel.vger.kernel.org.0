That makes sense to me.

Sorry, I should have been more clear. They are managed as a group - so
either the entire GPU is powered off, or powered on. There's no support
in Panfrost or mali_kbase for attempting to power part of the GPU.

Yes, you are correct. My concern is that a DT which specifies a new
regulator (e.g. "sram2") would be accepted by an old kernel (because it
wouldn't know to look for the new regulator) but wouldn't know to
control the regulator. It could then create a situation which puts the
board out of spec - potentially in a damaging way. Hence I'd like to
express the regulator structure in such a way that old kernels wouldn't
"half-work". Your "soft-PDC" approach would seem to fit that requirement.
