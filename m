Yes, the Linux block driver control the whole block device, it can do whatever it wants.
The firmware provides an interface for multiple users, and the mailbox controller just uses *one part* of it. So we should make sure that it's the right part.

Huh? Where does the SCPI or SCMI driver provide this? Those clients don't even provide any arguments. Adding some would defeat the whole point of having this mailbox in the first place, which was to provide a drop-in replacement for a hardware mailbox device used on other platforms.

Please read the SMCCC[1]: The first argument is in r1/w1/x1. r0/w0 is the function ID, and this is a specific value (fixed by the firmware implementation, see Peng's ATF patch) and not up to be guessed by a client.

Please keep in mind that we should *NOT* do smc calls without following the SMCCC spec.

Platform A uses PSCI, but no other SMCCC services, so in your scenario you assign a valid function ID say from the SIP range and tell the mailbox *client* to use it. Now you want to run this client on platform B, which happens to have chosen this very function ID for the "set fire on the device" SMCCC service.
So now you would need to assign different IDs to the *client*, depending on the platform? That doesn't make sense. The solution is that you just assign the function ID to the controller, in the (platform specific) DT, so it naturally matches the platform requirements. You can even change it over time, as long as you change both the DT and firmware at the same time.
The client (SCPI, for instance) is totally ignorant about this communication detail, it just needs some mailbox to request services.

That's why I think the function ID (which is part of the SMCCC protocol, not of the mailbox service!) should just be set in the controller DT node and nowhere else.

Cheers,
Andre.
