Yes, the current code does need some simplification.

I don't know of a crash or splat your patch would cause, if that is
your question.  But that is also true of the current code, so the point
is simplification, not bug fixing.  And from what I can see, there is an
opportunity to simplify quite a bit further.  And with something like
RCU, further simplification is worth -serious- consideration.

That might make a lot of sense.

In the meantime, could you please create an independent series (or
more than one series, as the case may be) of the other patches?

							Thanx, Paul
