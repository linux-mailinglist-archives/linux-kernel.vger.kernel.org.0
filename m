Surely distros also want one crashkernel* string they can use on all platforms without
having to detect the kernel version, platform or changeable memory layout...

Its tricky to work out which systems are the 'normal' ones.

We don't have a fixed memory layout for arm64. Some systems have no memory below 4G.
Others have no memory above 4G.

Chen Zhou's machine has some memory below 4G, but its too precious to reserve a large
chunk for kdump. Without any memory below 4G some of the drivers won't work.

I don't see what distros can set as their default for all platforms if high/low are
mutually exclusive with the 'crashkernel=' in use today. How did x86 navigate this, ... or
was it so long ago?

No one else has reported a problem with the existing placement logic, hence treating this
'low' thing as the 'in addition' special case.

Then my hurried reading of what the user-space code does was wrong!

If kexec-tools places the kernel in the low region, there may not be enough memory left
for whatever purpose it was reserved for. This was the motivation for giving it a
different name.


Thanks,
