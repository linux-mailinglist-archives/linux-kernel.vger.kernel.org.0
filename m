Yes, we are certainly cognizant of and sympathetic to the engineering
tensions involved.

The purpose of our e-mail was to leaven the discussion with the notion
that the most important question is how much complexity should be
shoved in either direction.  With respect to SGX as a technology, the
most important engineering metric is how much effective security is
actually being achieved.

Given an admission that enclave dynamic memory management (EDMM/SGX2)
is the goal in all of this, there are only two effective security
questions to be answered:

1.) Should a corpus of known memory with executable permissions be
copied into to an enclave.

2.) Should a corpus of executable memory with unknown content be
available to an enclave.

Given the functionality that SGX implements, both questions ultimately
devolve to whether or not a platform owner trusts an enclave author.
Security relevant trust is conveyed through cryptographically mediated
mechanisms.

The decision has been made to take full hardware mediated
cryptographic trust off the table for the mainstream Linux
implementation.  Given that, the most pragmatic engineering solution
would seem to be to implement the least complex implementation that
allows a platform owner to answer the two questions above.

Yes, we understood that when we wrote our original e-mail.

This model effectively allows the two relevant security questions to
be easily answered and is most consistent with current enclave
formats, software practices and runtimes.  It is also largely
consistent with existing LSM practices.

There hasn't been any discussion with respect to backports of this
driver but we believe it it safe to conclude that the industry is
going to be at least two years away from any type of realistic
deployments of this driver.  By that time there will be over a half a
decade of software deployment of existing API's and enclave formats.

Expecting a 'flag day' to be successful would seem to be contrary to
all known history of software practice and would thus disadvantage
Linux as an effective platform for this technology.

Best wishes for a productive remainder of the week to everyone.
