We unfortunately won't be able to attend on that topic this year. We however do have
some documentation describing the way we use statistics in our testing methodology,
although it requires some level of familiarity with the tooling [LISA].
The [slides] from Valentin at OSPM 2019 describes some other aspects regarding noise handling.
All of that should probably be aggregated in some tool-agnostic part of the LISA documentation to make it
easier to grasp by the wider community, especially when it comes to test framework capabilities comparison.

If someone fancies a chat on tooling capabilities, we are also reachable on #arm-lisa channel on
freenode during European working hours.
