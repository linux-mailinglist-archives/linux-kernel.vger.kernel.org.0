Up to a point, yes, our opinions differ. I'm not rejecting your suggestion,=
 I=20
just say that we should implement it as a last resort, when there's nothing=
=20
auto-detectable at run-time that can differentiate between two flashes that=

We can update the comment to clear the incertitude: "The F version advertis=

support for Fast Read 4-4-4""

The jedec-id should be unique in the first place, manufacturers that use th=
e=20
same jedec-id for different flavors of flashes are doing a bad thing. A thi=
rd=20
flash with the same jedec-id is unlikely to happen.

I prefer this because it's auto-detectable. If you don't feel well doing it=
,=20
don't do it.

You are raising theoretical problems. We can fix this when we will encounte=

mx25l8006e  defines bfpt, while mx25l8005 doesn't. We can differentiate the=

too.

You can speed up the process by reviewing/testing the BP3 support. In turn,=
=20
maybe Jungseung will review your OTP patches.

To sum up: the flash auto-detection (with capabilities) greatly ease the=20
device tree node description and it allows us to plug and play different=20
manufacturer flashes using the same dtb. I have a connector on one of my=20
boards, to which I connect different types of flashes (assuming they have=20
similar frequency and modes). So I would always prefer to have a post bfpt=
=20
hook to differentiate between flashes which share the same jedec-id, than=20
compromising the generic compatible. Of course, if there's nothing auto-
detectable that can differentiate between the flashes, then your idea can b=
e=20
implemented, but I would do this as a last resort.

There's also the idea of compromise. The jedec-id should be unique in the=20
first place, manufacturers that use the same jedec-id for different flavors=
 of=20
flashes are taking a wrong design decision. Do I want to cripple the generi=
c=20
compatible just for an old flash with a bad jedec-id? I don't know yet. Als=
o,=20
the flashes that share the same id are quite old, and if nobody screamed ab=
out=20
this until now, it's fine by me. You raised some theoretical questions, you=
=20
don't really use the macronix flashes, what I say is that we should conside=
r=20
fixing them when it's actually required. And that the extension of the=20
compatible should be done as a last resort, as of now it has more=20
disadvantages than advantages.
