so the jitted mmaps are inserted into the data file
and processed during report where they can overload
existing maps - thats detected before addition in:

  thread__insert_map
    map_groups__fixup_overlappings
      - which uses COW way -> map__clone(map, false);
        to create new map

other fixups to maps are being done only for kernel maps,
where we dont have a problem, because there's only one copy
