Hi Wambui, Julia,

Side-note: Wambui, your mail client seems to have added this header:

  Reply-To: alpine.DEB.2.21.1910240722070.2771@hadrien

This is the ID of the message you replied to (ie. this is the same value
that the In-Reply-To: header has). You should probably figure out how
that happened, or you're going to miss responses when people reply
without noticing the bogus email address.

Yes, that's correct. The driver was written to use the headers in
arch/mips/include/asm/octeon, and then recently the octeon-stubs.h
header was added which duplicates lots of the MIPS & Octeon-specific
header content in one huge monstrous file.

I'm all for improving compile test coverage, but I think octeon-stubs.h
in its short life has already proven itself to be a bad way to achieve
that goal[1][2][3].

It wouldn't hurt. I'd argue that Kconfig already provides enough
information to figure this out easily though - OCTEON_ETHERNET depends
on CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC || COMPILE_TEST, which ought to tell people that
its real use is when CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC=y. That doesn't necessarily point
you to cavium_octeon_defconfig (though grepping for CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC=y
would), but that's not strictly needed anyway - any old config with
CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC=y would do.

Thanks,
    Paul
