It describes an example as below

             hwc->interrupts = 1
             return 0
//A context switch right after the NMI.
//In the same tick, perf_throttled_seq is not changed.

I'm not sure if it's accurate to call it sample/non sample context.
Because for large PEBS, it should always output samples here for any cases.

As my understanding, the sample context you mean is actually the same as 
interrupt context.
   - handle_pmi_common(): -- NMI
   - intel_pmu_pebs_sched_task(): -- Can only be invoked in !NMI
   - intel_pmu_pebs_disable(): -- Can only be invoked in !NMI
     (I think there is only one case which the function will be called
      in NMI, throttling triggered x86_pmu_stop(). For this case, the
      PEBS buffer has been drained. __intel_pmu_pebs_event() will not
      be touched.)
   - intel_pmu_auto_reload_read(): Can only be invoked in NMI via
     PERF_SAMPLE_READ. For other cases, it will be only invoked in !NMI.

The throttling here is to control the number of interrupts. In NMI 
context, we should check the throttling. Otherwise, it's unnecessary.

I think the in_nmi() test should be enough here.

What's cond?
Could you please elaborate?
