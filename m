Sorry, maybe I misunderstood what you suggested. Correct me if my 
understanding is wrong.

Now the perf list output is like:

pipeline:
   event1
   event2
uncore:
   event3
   event4

My understanding for your suggestion is, we need to add "deprecated", 
for example:

pipeline:
   event1
   event2
uncore:
   event4
deprecated:
   event3

In above example, I assume the event3 is deprecated.

So my worry is, the user's old script may not find the event3 if we move 
it from "uncore" to "deprecated". Maybe I'm worried a lot. :(

Thanks
Jin Yao
