Yes.  But for MFD devices, I do think it makes sense for the MFD parent
device to request the entire memory resource, and then split it.

And for drivers that actually are aware of the struct resource given,
both approaches work.  Throwing away the resource.parent information
and calling out request_mem_region() manually breaks the idea of
managing IORESOURCE_MEM as a tree structure.

Are we not supposed to be using the parent/child part of struct
resource?

Sounds fine with me.  I was afraid that it could cause problems with
existing drivers, where platform_get_resource() would work, but return
something else than desired.  That would probably have gone unnoticed by
now.  But can ofcourse be fixed if it occurs.

You are right, this is not adequately described in commit message.
But unless we are not supposed to allow parent/child memory resource
management, I don't think it is a workaround, but a fix.

But I can split it out in a separate patch.  Would be nice if I at least
can get the other part of the change merged.
