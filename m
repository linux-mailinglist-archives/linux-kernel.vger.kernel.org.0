One thing I've always wanted from binutils is the ability to pass a flag to
the assembler which means that it accepts all of the instructions that it
knows about for a given major architecture (a bit like the '-cpu max' option
to qemu). Even better would be the ability to supply a file at build time
specifying the encodings, so that we could ship that with the kernel and
avoid some of the mess we have in places like sysreg.h were we end up
fighting against the assembler when trying to define new system register
accessors.

The latter suggestion is a bit "pie in the sky", but do you think there is
any scope for the former with clang?
