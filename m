That assumes a feature is broken out of the gate and is putting the
cart before the horse.  If a feature is available, it should work.  If
you later find it to be unsatisfactory, sure go out of your way to add
ugly compiler-specific version checks or upgrade your minimally
supported toolchain; until then feature detection is much cleaner (see
again __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__).

I think compiler flags are orthogonal to GNU C extensions we're discussing here.

I don't think so.  Can you show me an example codebase that proves me wrong?

That's a very autoconf centric viewpoint.  Why doesn't the kernel take
that approach for __GCC_ASM_FLAG_OUTPUTS__?  Why not repeatedly invoke
$CC to find if every compiler __attribute__ is supported?  Do you
think it's faster for the C preprocessor to check for a few #ifdefs,
or to repeatedly invoke $CC at build or compile time to detect new
features?
