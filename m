The CMA driver that registers these nodes will have to be expanded to
export them using this framework as needed. We do something similar to
export SRAM nodes:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/21/575

Unlike the system/default-cma driver which can be centralized in the
tree, these extra exporters will probably live out in other subsystems
and so are added in later steps.
