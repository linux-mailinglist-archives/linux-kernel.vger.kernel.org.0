I think that the different view is because I look at this API
from the reader API side. It is called the following way:

prb_read_valid(, seq, )
  _prb_read_valid( , &seq, )
    prb_read( , *seq, )
        # id is read from address defined by seq
	rdesc = dr->descs[seq & MASK];
	id = rdesc->state_var && MASK_ID;

        desc_read_commited( , id, seq, )
	  desc_read( , id, )
	    # desc is the same as rdesc above because
	    # seq & MASK == id & MASK
	    desc = dr->descs[id & MASK];

Note that prb_read_valid() and prb_read() are addressed by seq.

It would be perfectly fine to pass only seq to desc_read_committed()
and read id from inside.

The name desc_read_committed() suggests that the important condition
is that the descriptor is in the committed state. It is not obvious
that seq is important as well.

From my POV, it will be more clear to pass only seq and rename the
function to desc_read_by_seq() or so:

  + seq is enough for addressing
  + function returns true only when the stored seq matches
  + the stored seq is valid only when the state is committed
    or reusable


Please, do not reply to this mail. Either take the idea or keep
the code as is. I could live with it. And it is not important
enough to spend more time on it. I just wanted to explain my view.
But it is obviously just a personal preference.

Best Regards,
Petr
