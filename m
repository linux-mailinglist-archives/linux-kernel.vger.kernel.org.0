Maybe there's a way that we can switch to this method, and leave the 
door open for an easy way to support firmware-level identifier again, if 
ever needed. I'm not too pushed - this was secondary to just allowing 
the PMCG driver know the associated SMMU model.

And, no, hi161x does not have any PMCGs.

So to support PMCGs that reference a Named Component or Root Complex, I 
thought that the IORT parsing code would have to do some secondary 
lookup to the associated SMMU, through the Named Component or Root 
Complex node.

What was your idea here?

Note: I do acknowledge that an overall issue is that we assume all PMCG 
IMP DEF events are same for a given SMMU model.

For DT, I would assume that we just use compatible strings would allow 
us to identify the PMCG model.

On a related matter, is there still a need to deal with scenarios of the 
PMCG being located within the SMMU register map? As you may remember, we 
did have this issue but relocated the PMCG to outside the SMMU register 
map in a later chip rev.

John
