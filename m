Got it, thanks! Now I see it would be more logical to have 3 patches
in the following order:
- i2c driver renaming
- additional regulator cell
- early init

If you don't mind - I'd wait for other people to comment on this
patch, collect all points, and then come up with v2 of this patch (and
whole series in fact).

Would certainly do!
