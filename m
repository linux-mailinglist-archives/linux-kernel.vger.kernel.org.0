I think we're still not taking on the same page.

My patch makes no attempt to make partial power down mode work.  My
patch attempts to make things work a little better when using
DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE.  There is no use testing my patch with
partial power down as it shouldn't have any impact there.

We must be looking at different code.  I'm looking at Linux's tree, AKA:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/dri=
vers/usb/dwc2/hcd.c#n3488

I took a mainline kernel ("v5.1-rc7-5-g83a50840e72a") and added
printouts in dwc2_port_suspend() next to where it set HPRT0_SUSP and
PCGCTL_STOPPCLK in dwc2_port_suspend().

[  454.906364] dwc2 ff540000.usb: I'm setting HPRT0_SUSP
[  454.906367] dwc2 ff540000.usb: I'm setting PCGCTL_STOPPCLK

...and just to confirm:

# grep '^power' /sys/kernel/debug/*.usb/params
/sys/kernel/debug/ff540000.usb/params:power_down                    : 0
/sys/kernel/debug/ff580000.usb/params:power_down                    : 0

So I'm really quite convinced that on mainline Linux with
DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE that dwc2_port_suspend() sets HPRT0_SUSP
and PCGCTL_STOPPCLK.

The purpose is to make _dwc2_hcd_suspend() work more correctly in the
case where power_down is DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE

Right.  I have been trying to say that my patch doesn't do anything at
all for partial power down.  I am simply trying to make
DWC2_POWER_DOWN_PARAM_NONE work more correctly.

I haven't run all the power consumption tests in quite a long time and
I'll try to get it hooked up tomorrow to confirm that my patch really
truly is still needed to help with power consumption.  I did confirm
that at least there are cases where _dwc2_hcd_suspend() is called and
my patch is what sets the important bits.
