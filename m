Hi Yuri,

I haven't reviewed the new implementation yet, just a few comments so
far:

I don't see how: src is always on the opposite side of the cut compared
to dst, and bits are copied one by one.

Also note that I originally designed this function for the single usage
it has, that is, with src being the same as dst, and this is the only
way it is used, so this case is rather well tested. Do you have any
specific case in mind?

Nice, indeed.

Also nice.

I'm not fond of it either, but this wasn't just "inspired" by
bitmap_shift_*: I wanted to maintain a consistent interface with those,
and all the other functions of this kind taking separate dst and src.

For the current usage, performance isn't exceedingly relevant. If you
have another use case in mind where it's relevant, by all means, I
think it makes sense to change the interface.

Otherwise, I would still have a slight preference towards keeping the
interface consistent.

By the way, I don't think it's possible to do that keeping the
memmove(), and at the same time implement the rest of this change,
because then we might very well hit some unexpected behaviour, using
bitmap_shift_right() later.

All in all, I don't have a strong preference against this -- but I'm
not too convinced it makes sense either.
