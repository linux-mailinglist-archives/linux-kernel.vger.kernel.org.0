Do you send an ipi to the other CPUs. I would just to be safe.

No, I think I got confused ;-), it's the patch out that I was worried
about, but when I was going through the scenario, I somehow turned it
into the patching in (which I already audited :-p). I was going to
reply with just the top part of this email, but then the confusion
started :-/

OK, yes, patching out should be fine, and you already covered the
patching in. Sorry for the noise.

Just to confirm and totally remove the confusion, the patch does:

	<func>:
	mflr	r0 <-- preempt here
	bl	_mcount

	<func>:
	mflr	r0
	nop

And this is fine regardless.
