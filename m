Subject: Running BOINC Project (SETI@home) for 48 Hours Killed My
Galax GeForce GTX 1650 4 GB GDDR5 GPU

Good day from Singapore,

I bought my Galax GeForce GTX1650 4 GB GDDR5 GPU on 29th September 2019 Sunday.

At the time of this writing, it is 5th October 2019 Saturday.

Over the past 48 hours, I have been running BOINC project (SETI@home)
on my Windows 10 Home Edition home desktop computer. This morning, my
home desktop computer suddenly gave me a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)
with the error code: "Windows System Exception".

I thought my Windows 10 had become corrupted. ***Every time Windows 10
boots up, it would show me a BLANK SCREEN after a few seconds.***

I have tried the following resolution methods for about 2 hours on a
Saturday morning but NOTHING worked.

1. I tried to perform Windows Startup Repair but it would not run.

2. I tried to start Windows in SAFE mode but it would show me a BLANK
SCREEN as well.

3. I tried to start Windows in SAFE mode with Networking but it would
show me a BLANK SCREEN as well.

4. I tried to start Windows with low video resolution but it would
show me a BLANK SCREEN as well.

5. I tried to start Windows with Driver Signature Signing disabled but
it would show me a BLANK SCREEN as well.

6. I tried to run "sfc /scannow" on a command prompt but it would not run.

7. I tried to uninstall Windows quality updates but it would still
show me a BLANK SCREEN.

8. I tried to uninstall Windows feature update but it would still show
me a BLANK SCREEN.

9. I tried to perform System Restore but Windows would still show me a
BLANK SCREEN.

In short, none of the resolution methods which I have tried above worked.

Exasperated, I tried to reset Windows 10 while retaining personal
data. After resetting Windows 10, I *successfully* booted into Windows
with a Basic Microsoft Display Adapter Driver. Then I tried to install
NVIDIA drivers. When NVIDIA drivers started to load, my Windows showed
me a BLANK SCREEN AGAIN. At this point, I realized that my Galax
GeForce GTX 1650 4 GB GDDR5 GPU has been killed/fried by BOINC project
(SETI@home).

On 5th October 2019 Saturday afternoon, I took my Galax GeForce GTX
1650 4 GB GDDR5 GPU to the 4th story computer shop in Sim Lim Square
in Singapore for a 7-day 1-to-1 exchange, citing that the Galax GPU
has malfunctioned. The shop keeper gave me a MSI GeForce GTX 1650
Ventus XS OC 4 GB GDDR5 GPU as replacement but I have to top up
SGD$10.

When I brought the replacement MSI GeForce GTX 1650 Ventus XS OC 4 GB
GDDR5 GPU home, I plugged it into my home desktop computer and Windows
10 booted up *SUCCESSFULLY*. I proceeded to reinstall NVIDIA drivers
again. Everything went well and everything is working fine now.

Conclusion: BOINC project (SETI@home) fried my Galax GeForce GTX1650 4
GB GDDR5 GPU after 48 hours. Now I am actually afraid of running
SETI@home again for fear of frying my replacement MSI GeForce GTX 1650
4 GB GDDR5 GPU again.

Question: Will BOINC project (SETI@home) be able to work towards
ensuring that it will not fry anyone's GPU again? I had my whole
Saturday wasted. It was only Saturday evening when I returned home and
got everything working again.

Thank you very much.
