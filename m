Thank you for tracing through this!

That can indeed happen.  However, in current -rcu, that would mean
that .deferred_qs is also set, which (if in_irq()) would prevent
the raise_softirq_irqsoff() from being invoked.  Which was why I was
asking the questions about whether in_irq() returns true within threaded
interrupts yesterday.  If it does, I need to find if there is some way
of determining whether rcu_read_unlock_special() is being called from
a threaded interrupt in order to suppress the call to raise_softirq()
in that case.

But which version of the kernel are you using here?  Current -rcu?
v5.2-rc1?  Something else?

							Thanx, Paul
