I can say it's partially both.

1. The hardware is designed keeping in mind multiple transport protocols:
   doorbell mode, single word and multiple work(only in newer versions)
   Using that hardware capability provides access to multiple channels
   to the software.

2. I can also view this as software defined mailboxes if we go by
   definition that each channel should have associated dedicated interrupt
   as Jassi mentions.

The main idea is that each bit in these 32-bit registers can be written
atomically without the need of read-modify-write enabling software to
implement multiple channels in lock-less way.

Correct.

As I tried to simply in my cover letter, I will try to explain in simpler
terms.

 1. This version of hardware has 3 blocks(one for secure and 2 non-secure)
    Each block has 3 sets of 32-bit registers(SET, CLEAR and STATUS)
    SET and CLEAR are write only and STATUS is read-only.

    Each block has a dedicated interrupt line.

2. The hardware was designed to cater 2 transport protocols. A single
   word transfer(non-zero) or each bit in doorbell mode.

3. The next version extends with each block having larger than 32-bit
   window(up to 124 words) allowing it to used it for multiple
   word as transport protocol. Mainly for some IoT usecase.

So what I am trying to convey here is MHU controller hardware can be
used choosing one of the  different transport protocols available and
that's platform choice based on the use-case.

The driver in the kernel should identify the same from the firmware/DT
and configure it appropriately.

It may get inefficient and sometime impossible to address all use-case
if we stick to one transport protocol in the driver and try to build
an abstraction on top to use in different transport mode.

Hope this clarify things little bit more.
