GregKH has already queued this for Linux-5.5 and you can see this
commit present in linux-next tree:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/drivers/platform/goldfish?h=next-20191022

Nopes, it's not RPC driver. In fact, all Goldfish virtual platform devices
are MMIO devices.

No, it's not overkill. All Goldfish virtual platform devices are quite simple
MMIO devices having bare minimum registers required for device
functioning.

The problem is VirtIO spec does not define any RTC device so instead of
inventing our own virtual RTC device we re-use RTC device defined in
Goldfish virtual platform for QEMU virt machine. This way we can re-use
the Linux Goldfish RTC driver.

BTW, I will send-out QEMU Goldfish RTC patches today or tomorrow
addressing nit comments from Alistair.
