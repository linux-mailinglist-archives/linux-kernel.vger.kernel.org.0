In iommu_insert_resv_region(), we are overlapping regions of the same
type. So iommu_get_group_resv_regions() should return both the relaxable
region and non relaxable one. I should test this again using a hacked
kernel though.

Fur sure, today, those regions are exposed as "direct". Isn't this
information relevant to the userspace as it would rather not use those
direct regions. We eventually chose to implement the check inside the
VFIO driver but I understood we wanted this info to be visible. Then it
is arguable whether we should expose the new relaxable type, at the pain
of making the UABI evolve.

That's not my current understanding. I think those RMRRs may be used
post-boot (especially the IGD stolen memory covered by RMRR). I
understand this depends on the video mode or FW in use by the IGD. But I
am definitively not an expert here.

Thank you Robin. Let's see if we can converge ...
