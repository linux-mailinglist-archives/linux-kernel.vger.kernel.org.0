Generally speaking there is no much difference at what moment the driver
is loaded and device is probed. First of all the L2-RAM latencies should be
setup by the system bootloader before RAM is detected and the memory controller
is enabled and run (though default value is normally Ok to use). In a worst case
if the bootloader did something wrong it may cause either the performance
degradation (up to 10% - 20% drop), or the system may get to be absolutely
unstable. In the later the kernel (and bootloader) may collapse at any moment,
most likely before the driver is loaded even at the very first possible stage.
Due to this uncertainty the upcoming l2-cache tuning stage doesn't really matter.

So this driver can be used either to tune the system performance up by updating
the system dtb while leaving the bootloader code unchanged, or by setting the
latencies from user-space to the corresponding sysfs nodes exported by
the driver.
