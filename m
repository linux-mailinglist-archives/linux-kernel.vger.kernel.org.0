This has been a long standing issue with clk framework. Some clk
providers work around it by marking clks like UART as special and keep
them on whenever earlycon is present on the commandline. Mike tried to
do something about this too[1] but that patchset only merged the
critical clk part and not the handoff part. How does this compare with
what Mike attempted many years ago?

It may also be a good first step to merely detect that a clk is enabled
at boot and to inform the framework that the clk is enabled and
synchronize the state of the clk out of boot with the state that the
framework is tracking. Essentially try to avoid the "when to turn it
off" problem and fix the "what state is the clk in at boot" problem. We
have clk providers that want to know this detail and currently
workaround it by reading the state in their prepare/enable ops and bail
out early, or read the enable state in their set_rate method and try to
make the rate change go through. It's a mess.

How do we know some consumer won't "put in their votes" after late init?
I suspect we should somehow scan the entire DT to determine what
consumers exist and then match those consumers up with the clks that
providers detect are on out of boot and then only remove the enable
state of a clk once all consumers have gotten and enabled their clks.

Please mention something about the new clk flag introduced and why it is
introduced. Also talk about orphan clks and why they're special.

Why are orphans special?
