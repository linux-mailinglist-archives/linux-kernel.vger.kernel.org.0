Right. This is entirely done in hardware with a GPU that has complete access to
the context bank registers. All the driver does is send the PTBASE to the
command stream see [1] and especially [2] (look for CP_SMMU_TABLE_UPDATE).

As for interacting with the io-pgtable directly I would love to do that but it
would need some new infrastructure to either pull the io-pgtable from the aux
domain or to create an io-pgtable ourselves and pass it for use by the aux
domain. I'm not sure if that is better for the layering violation.

Right now the GPU microcode still uses TLBIALL. I want to assign each new aux
domain its own ASID in the hopes that we could some day change that but for now
having a uinque ASID doesn't help.
