You can drop the first sentence from the commit message. The SoB below
is sufficient.

The purpose is to cap to the ACPI region when we partially overlap to
workaround BIOS's reporting corrupted ACPI tables so that we don't get
failure from devm_ioremap().

The only funky thing in that function is that it lets through a buffer
that is fully outside the ACPI region. There actually exists hardware
with this configuration.

This is not true. The driver deals with only one ACPI region ATM.

The driver gets command and response buffer metrics from the TPM2 ACPI
table, not from the ACPI region.

This cannot be categorized as a bug. It is simply as new type of hardware.
Can you explain in detail what type of hardware are you using?

With a quick spin w/o knowing the details of the hardware I'm dealing
with it you should probably reduce the fixup function as

static u64 crb_fixup_cmd_size(struct device *dev, struct resource *io_res,
			      u64 start, u64 size)
{
	if (start + size - 1 <= io_res->end)
		 return size;

	dev_err(dev,
		 FW_BUG "ACPI region does not cover the entire command/response buffer. %pr vs %llx %llx\n",
		 io_res, start, size);

	return io_res->end - start + 1;
}

Then call this inside the loop.

Looking at your change it does not make much sense to me.

There is a weird asymmetry in it:

1. The code loops through all found ACPI regions when looking for
   intersections with the command and response buffers.
2. The devm_ioremap() is done only to the last seen ACPI region. Why the
   multiple regions matter for fixup's but not in this case?
