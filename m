The frame shape typically only changes by doubling the number of 
columns, and the priority is given to PDM streams which use columns. 
It's hard to document this on a public mailing list, it'd require making 
references to a spec that's only available to MIPI members.

To the best of my knowledge, the algorithm follows a script that is used 
for both Windows and Linux. The code was initially written by Vinod and 
team, and I am not aware of simplifications.
There a simplifications that are possible, e.g. we don't support PDM for 
now and the notion of grouping is not needed, but we have to carefully 
balance 'optimization' with 'introducing bugs'. if this algorithm craps 
out then the entire bus operation is in the weeds.

If we really want people to experiment and get a feel for the 
performance of the algorithm, we should really provide a UI where the 
stream parameters can be entered and visually check what the algorithm 
is doing. I have a solution that shows the bits based on the stream 
parameters (need to make it available e.g. in Python), if we connected 
it with the automatic bit allocation it'd be very useful.

Resource management is indeed a bit vague. But frame shape calculator is 
not quite right. The algorithm will find the frame shape that is 
required for the current bandwidth, but will also allocate the bitSlots 
in that frame. In MIPI circles we talk about bitSlot allocation.
