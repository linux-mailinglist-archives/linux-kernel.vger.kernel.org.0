Good catch, but this just needs one more perf_event_open(),
right? :)

Ah, yes, this probably explains why it is harder to trigger than I expected.

Not sure if I follow you, but if there is no cgroup event, cgrp_cpuctx_list
should be empty, right?

From the stack traces I can't tell, what I can tell is that we use cgroup
events in most cases.

Hmm? perf_ctx_lock() is taken in perf_cgroup_switch(), so I think locking
is fine.

Thanks.
