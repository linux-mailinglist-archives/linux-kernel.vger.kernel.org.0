Maulik,

I'd appreciate if you could Cc me on all irqchip patches.

Loosing interrupt delivery in idle is not an acceptable behaviour. Idle 
!= suspend.

Indeed. Idle states shouldn't affect irq delivery. The irq_set_wake() 
call
deals with suspend, and idle is rather different from suspend.

Conflating the two seems pretty broken, and definitely goes against the
expected behaviour of device drivers. Is the expectation now that we are
going to see a flurry of patches adding irq_set_wake() calls all over 
the map?

That'd be terribly broken. We've had a similar discussion about a NXP
platform where only some interrupts could wake take the CPU out of idle.
The end result is that we don't idle on this system.

If the PDC can't take the CPU out of idle, then idle shouldn't be 
entered
when these broken interrupts are enabled.

Thanks,

         M.
