Yeah, it's sorta not documented on purpose. It's too easy to get wrong
and we've only used it inside a number of more convenient primitives as
an optimzation.

I suppose we could add it to the section on control dependencies; just
to scare more people :-)

Right, so the purpose of the barrier is to upgrade a LOAD->STORE order
(as provided by the ctrl-dep) to a LOAD->{LOAD,STORE} order as would be
provided by load-acquire.
