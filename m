Subject: [PATCH] lib: Fix Kconfig indentation
Date:   Thu, 21 Nov 2019 04:24:20 +0100
Message-Id: <1574306660-27099-1-git-send-email-krzk@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Adjust indentation from spaces to tab (+optional two spaces) as in
coding style with command like:
	$ sed -e 's/^        /\t/' -i */Kconfig

Signed-off-by: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>

Changes since v1:
1. Fix also 7-space and tab+1 space indentation issues.
