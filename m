Hi Lianbo,

For kexec/kdump patches, please remember to cc kexec list next time.
Also it is definitely kdump specific issue, I added Vivek and Eric in
cc.

The log is too simple,  I know you did some other tries to fix this, but
the patch log does not show why you can not correctly copy the 640k in
current kdump code, in purgatory here.

Also this patch seems works in your test, but still to see if other
people can comment and see if it is safe or not, if any other risks
other than waste the small chunk of memory.  If it is safe then kdump
can just drop the backup logic and use this in common code instead of
only do it for SME.
