What context is that happening in?  If the tracepoint-saves-CR2 patch
is in, then it should be fine if it nests inside of tracing, right?
And NMI needs to save and restore CR2 no matter what, since it can
happen before we can possibly save CR2.  For that matter, MCE should
save and restore CR2 as well.

All that being said, I do like the idea of moving all this crud (IRQ
tracing, CR2 handling, and context tracking) into C.  I haven't had
time to review that part of Peter's series yet, but I should get to it
soon.
