Adding John into CC. He takes care of printk() in RT kernel.

What is the motivation for the change, please?
Have you just noticed the inconsistency between normal and RT kernel?
Or was there any bug report?

We need to be careful to do not break user space. And this patch
modifies the existing behavior.

Who would set sequence 0, please?

IMHO, the patch is wrong.

devkmsg_open() initializes user->seq to a valid sequence number.
We should return -EPIPE when user->seq == 0 during devkmsg_open()
and the first messages got lost before the first read.

I agree.
