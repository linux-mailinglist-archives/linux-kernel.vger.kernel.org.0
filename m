I've lost the plot on this patch.  I have the v3 patch plus these fixes:

http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20191028221414.3685035-1-songliubraving@fb.com
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20191022191006.411277-1-songliubraving@fb.com
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20191030200736.3455046-1-songliubraving@fb.com

and there's a v4 which I can't correlate with the above.  And there has
been discussion about deferring some of the filemap_flush() changes
until later.

So I think it's best if we just start again.  Can you please prepare
and send out a v5 (which might be a 2-patch series)?
