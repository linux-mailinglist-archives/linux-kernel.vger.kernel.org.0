OK, this is a bit relieving. I thought that there are legitimate cases
when none of the hugetlb gets the HWPoison bit (e.g. when the page has 0
reference count which is the case here). That would be utterly broken
because we would have no way to tell the page is hwpoisoned.

Anyway, do you think the patch as I've posted makes sense regardless
another potential problem? Or would you like to resend yours which skips
over tail pages at once?
