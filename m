Agreed. The commit message should mention this though.

If a dts can be updated in a compatible way, we should do that rather
than carry inconsistencies into the schema.

That would be a bug. You're saying something like this doesn't work?:

oneOf:
  - minItems: 1
    maxItems: 3
    items:
      - const: a
      - const: b
      - const: c

Not sure which part you mean? json-schema is the vocabulary which has
a spec. The meta-schema then constrains what the json-schema structure
should look like. That's still evolving a bit as I try to improve it
based on mistakes people make. Then there's the intermediate .dt.yaml
format used internally. That's supposed to stay internal and may go
away when/if we integrate the validation into dtc.

Schema failures or dts failures? It is possible to get line numbers
for either, but that makes validation much slower. In the latter case,
the line numbers aren't too useful either given they are for the
.dt.yaml file and not the .dts source file (dtc integration would
solve that). Adding '-n' to dt-doc-validate or dt-validate will turn
them on though.

Yes, error messages need work. I have some idea how to improve them,
but haven't had time to implement. Too many binding reviews... You can
get more detail with '-v' option. It's *way* more verbose, but not
necessarily more useful.
