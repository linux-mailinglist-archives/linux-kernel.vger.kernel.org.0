Please consider the following information and cost estimate in
bytes for requiring page structs for PCI memory if used with
scatterlists. For example, a 128GB PCI memory address space
could require as much as 256MB of system memory just for
page struct backing. In a 1GB 64-bit system with flat memory
model, that consumes 25% of available memory. However,
not all of the 128GB PCI memory may be mapped for use at
a given time depending on the application. The cost of PCI
page structs is an upfront cost to be paid at system start.

pci memory start: 0x2000000000
pci memory size: 128GB  0x2000000000

pci page_size: 64KB  0x10000
pci page_shift: 16  0x10
pci pages: 2MB  0x200000
pci epc bitmap_size: 256KB  0x40000

pci page_size: 4KB  0x1000
pci page_shift: 12  0xc
pci pages: 32MB  0x2000000
pci epc bitmap_size: 4MB  0x400000

system page size: 4KB  0x1000
linux page struct size: 8B
pci page struct cost: 256MB  0x10000000
