I see.

Just want to make sure I understand it correctly:

sysfs_create_group() should not be called if cpuhp_setup_state() has
 error.

Otherwise, the sysadmin can change the MSR through the sysfs interface.
After that, a CPU is online and its MSR is not updated because cpu_online
is not installed. Then this online CPU has different MSR value from
the other CPUs.

Is that right?

Thanks.
