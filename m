So, with my series[1] applied, ld.bfd builds clean. With ld.lld, I get a
TON of warnings, such as:

(.bss.rel.ro) is being placed in '.bss.rel.ro'
(.iplt) is being placed in '.iplt'
(.plt) is being placed in '.plt'
(.rela.altinstr_aux) is being placed in '.rela.altinstr_aux'
(.rela.altinstr_replacement) is being placed in
'.rela.altinstr_replacement'
(.rela.altinstructions) is being placed in '.rela.altinstructions'
(.rela.apicdrivers) is being placed in '.rela.apicdrivers'
(.rela__bug_table) is being placed in '.rela__bug_table'
(.rela.con_initcall.init) is being placed in '.rela.init.data'
(.rela.cpuidle.text) is being placed in '.rela.text'
(.rela.data..cacheline_aligned) is being placed in '.rela.data'
(.rela.data) is being placed in '.rela.data'
(.rela.data..percpu) is being placed in '.rela.data..percpu'
(.rela.data..percpu..page_aligned) is being placed in '.rela.data..percpu'
...

But as you can see in the /DISCARD/, these (and all the others), should
be getting caught:

        /DISCARD/ : {
                *(.eh_frame)
+               *(.rela.*) *(.rela_*)
+               *(.rel.*) *(.rel_*)
+               *(.got) *(.got.*)
+               *(.igot.*) *(.iplt)
        }

I don't understand what's happening here. I haven't minimized this case
nor opened an lld bug yet.

Actually, it's rather opposed to the FGKASLR series, as for that, I need
some kind of linker script directive like this:

	/PASSTHRU/ : {
		*(.text.*)
	}

Where "PASSTHRU" would create a 1-to-1 input-section to output-section
with the same name, flags, etc.

ld.bfd's handling of orphan sections named .text.* is to put them each
as a separate output section, after the existing .text output section.

ld.lld's handling of orphan sections named .text.* is to put them into
the .text output section.

For FGKASLR (as it is currently implemented[2]), the sections need to be
individually named output sections (as bfd does it). *However*, with the
"warn on orphans" patch, FGKASLR's intentional orphaning will backfire
(I guess the warning could be turned off, but I'd like lld to handle
FGKASLR at some point.)

Note that cheating and doing the 1-to-1 mapping by handy with a 40,000
entry linker script ... made ld.lld take about 15 minutes to do the
final link. :(

Totally agreed. I just hope there's a good solution for this PASSTHRU
idea...
