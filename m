So your suggestion is to add a has_acpi_companion() check before
mctrl_gpio_init() is called in serial8250_register_8250_port() and
then only use the gpio related mctrl, if the GPIO's are really used?

I can certainly change patch 2/2 to do this. It would be great though,
if you (or someone else) could test this on such a ACPI based platform,
as I don't have access to such a board.

Thanks,
Stefan
