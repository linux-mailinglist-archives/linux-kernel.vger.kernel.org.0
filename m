[This email was generated by a script.  Let me know if you have any suggestions
to make it better, or if you want it re-generated with the latest status.]

Of the currently open syzbot reports against the upstream kernel, I've manually
marked 19 of them as possibly being bugs in the perf subsystem.  I've listed
these reports below, sorted by an algorithm that tries to list first the reports
most likely to be still valid, important, and actionable.

Of these 19 bugs, 4 were seen in mainline in the last week.

Of these 19 bugs, 2 were bisected to commits from the following people:

	Song Liu <songliubraving@fb.com>
	Kan Liang <kan.liang@linux.intel.com>

If you believe a bug is no longer valid, please close the syzbot report by
sending a '#syz fix', '#syz dup', or '#syz invalid' command in reply to the
original thread, as explained at https://goo.gl/tpsmEJ#status

If you believe I misattributed a bug to the perf subsystem, please let me know,
and if possible forward the report to the correct people or mailing list.

Here are the bugs:

I'm not confident this bug is really in the perf subsystem.  I also think it
might be in the fs/ext4 subsystem.

This bug has a syzkaller reproducer only.

syzbot has bisected this bug, but I think the bisection result is incorrect.

For some reason the original report email for this bug is missing from the LKML
archive at lore.kernel.org, so my script couldn't check whether anyone has
replied to it or not.  The Google Groups link above should still work, though. 
Also try searching for the bug title.
