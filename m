pages_correctly_probed() is a leftover from ancient times. It dates
back to commit 3947be1969a9 ("[PATCH] memory hotplug: sysfs and
add/remove functions"), where Pg_reserved checks were added as a sfety ne=
t:
	/*
	 * The probe routines leave the pages reserved, just
	 * as the bootmem code does.  Make sure they're still
	 * that way.
	 */
The checks were refactored quite a bit over the years, especially in
commit b77eab7079d9 ("mm/memory_hotplug: optimize probe routine"), where
checks for present, valid, and online sections were added.

Hotplugged memory is added via add_memory(), which will create the full
memmap for the hotplugged memory, and mark all sections valid and present=
.
Only full memory blocks are onlined/offlined, so we also cannot have an
inconsistency in that regard (especially, memory blocks with some section=
s
being online and some being offline).

1. Boot memory always starts online. Since commit c5e79ef561b0
   ("mm/memory_hotplug.c: don't allow to online/offline memory blocks wit=
h
     holes") we disallow to offline any memory with holes. Therefore,
   we never online memory with holes. Present and validity checks are
   superfluous.

2. Only complete memory blocks are onlined/offlined (and especially,
   the state - online or offline - is stored for whole memory blocks).
   Besides the core, only arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/memtrace.c
   manually calls offline_pages() and fiddels with memory block states.
   But it also only offlines complete memory blocks.

3. To make any of these conditions trigger, something would have to be
   terribly messed up in the core. (e.g., online/offline only some sectio=
ns
   of a memory block).

4. Memory unplug properly makes sure that all sysfs attributes were
   removed (and therefore, that all threads left the sysfs handlers). We
   don't have to worry about zombie devices at this point.

5. The valid_section_nr(section_nr) check is actually dead code, as it
   would never have been reached due to the
   WARN_ON_ONCE(!pfn_valid(pfn)).

No wonder we haven't seen any of these errors in a long time (or even
ever, according to my search). Let's just get rid of them. Now, all check=
s
that could hinder onlining and offlining are completely contained in
online_pages()/offline_pages().
