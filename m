So, I think I take that last part back. I just hit a case where I built
the kernel manually, made a copy of vmlinux to vmlinux.copy, and file(1)
said both were fine (and cmp(1) agreed they were identical). Then I went
off and did work elsewhere with a lot of I/O. When I came back to the
linux build dir, vmlinux was broken, exactly as before. So I now suspect
it to be some kind of "while the file is in the pagecache, everything is
fine, but when it's read back from disk it's broken".

My ext4 fs does have inline_data enabled, which could explain why the
corruption happens in the beginning. It's just very odd that it only
ever seems to trigger for vmlinux and not other files, but perhaps the
I/O patterns that ld and/or sortextable does are exactly what are needed
to trigger the bug.

I've done a long overdue kernel update, and there are quite a few
fs/ext4/ -stable patches in there, so now I'll see if it still happens.
And if anything more comes of this, I'll remove the kbuild and ppc lists
from cc, sorry for the noise.
