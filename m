We only currently have 8 of those in USB:
	- over current notification (the new one added)
	- gadget driver removed
	- gadget driver unregistered (these 2 are odd...)
	- phy charger state change (like other power sources provide)
	- typec alt mode change
	- typec data role change
	- typec power role change
	- typec vconn role change
	- typec power operation change

Only the over current notification is something that is "not normal",
and was just recently added because no one could think of a better way
to do it.

But now we have a better way to do it :)

Most of those are state changes, which is fine.  They are not error
conditions, correct?

You can write notifier libraries for any subsystem, no need to link
against any other type of subsystem (i.e. if you only care about USB
ones, you will not need keyutils.)

What other event do you get today that requires you to use libudev that
a notifier for USB events would not provide you?  Also, given that we
haven't written such code, we can work together to ensure that all of
the events you care about are present.

For USB, there is only one such odd event (as listed above).  For other
kobjects, we can work to implement state change notification as well.

Please respond to David's patch series if you have any questions/issues
about it.  I do not want to add random new USB event notifications
through KOBJ_CHANGE until we come to a decision as to what this new
event notification framework will look like.  If it is not possible for
USB to fit into that, then I will be glad to revisit this patch.

thanks,
