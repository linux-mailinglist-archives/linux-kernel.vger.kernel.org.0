Yes, this feature register only shows the physical presence on the unit
in hardware.

Yes, the same as above, this only shows their physical presence. For
AMUv1 - AMCGCR_ELO.CG0NC: the value of this field is set to 4.
AMCGCR_ELO.CG1NC will show the number of auxiliary counters implemented
in hardware.

Or you won't be able to access them at all. Lacking firmware support
accesses to AMU registers could be trapped in EL3. If access for EL1 and
EL2 is enabled from EL3, it's still possible that the counters
themselves are not enabled - that means they are not enabled to count
the events they are designed to be counting. That's why in this case the
event counter register could read 0.

But if we read 0, it does not necessarily mean that the counter is
disabled. It could also mean that the events is meant to count did not
happen yet.

I'm reluctant to do this especially given that platforms might choose to
keep some counters disabled while enabling some counters that might not
have counted any events by the time we reach cpu_enable. We would end up
mistakenly disabling the feature. I would rather leave the validation of
the counters to be done at the location and for the purpose of their
use: see patch 6/6 - the use of counters for frequency invariance.

I think it should be up to the user of that counter to decide if the
usecase is at CPU level or system level. My intention of this base
support was to keep it simple and allow users of some counters to
decide on their own how to validate and make use of either architected
or auxiliary counters.

For example, in the case of frequency invariance, given a platform that
does not support cpufreq based invariance, I would validate all CPUs for
the use of AMU core and constant counters. If it happens that some CPUs
do not support those counters or they are not enabled, we'd have to
disable frequency invariance at system level.

For some other scenarios only partial support is needed - only a subset
of CPUs need to support the counters for their use to be feasible.

But I believe only the user of the counters can decide, whether this is
happening in architecture code, driver code, generic code.

Right! This is more of a guideline: it can be a subset as well, if
platforms don't want some counters enabled. It can set the lower 4 bits
for enablement of all 4 architecture counters for v1, or more for future
versions with more architected counters.

Thanks,
Ionela.
