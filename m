> I understand your concern here. But I guess we are making too much assump=
tion on how enclaves are structured/packaged. My concern is, what if a SIGS=
TRUCT really has to be from memory? For example, an enclave (along with its=
 SIGSTRUCT) could be embedded inside a shared object (or even the "main" ex=
ecutable) so it shows up in memory to begin with.

Hmm.  That's a fair point, although opening /proc/self/exe could be
somewhat of a workaround.  It does suffer from a bit of an in-band
signaling problem, though, in that it's possible that some other
random bytes in the library resemble a SIGSTRUCT.

> I was not saying enclaves were exempt to good security practices. What I =
was trying to say was, EPC pages are *not* subject to the same attacks as r=
egular pages so I suspect there will be a desire to enforce different polic=
ies on them, especially after new SGX2 features/applications become availab=
le. So I think it beneficial to distinguish between regular vs. enclave vir=
tual ranges. And to do that, a new VM_SGX flag in VMA is probably a very si=
mple/easy way. And with that VM_SGX flag, we could add a new security_sgx_m=
prot() hook so that LSM modules/policies could act differently.

I'm not opposed to this, but I also don't think this needs to be in
the initial upstream driver.  VM_SGX also isn't strictly necessary --
an LSM could inspect the VMA to decide whether it's an SGX VMA if it
really wanted to.

That being said, do you have any specific behavior differences in mind
aside from the oddities involved in loading the enclave.

>
> And if you are with me on that bigger picture, the next question is: what=
 should be the default behavior of security_sgx_mprot() for existing/non-SG=
X-aware LSM modules/policies? I'd say a reasonable default is to allow R, R=
W and RX, but not anything else. It'd suffice to get rid of EXECMEM/EXECMOD=
 requirements on enclave applications. For SGX1, EPCM permissions are immut=
able so it really doesn't matter what security_sgx_mprot() does. For SGX2 a=
nd beyond, there's still time and new SGX-aware LSM modules/policies will p=
robably have emerged by then.

I hadn't thought about the SGX1 vs SGX2 difference.  If the driver
initially only wants to support SGX1, then I guess we really could get
away with constraining the EPC flags based on the source page
permission and not restricting mprotect() and mmap() permissions on
/dev/sgx/enclave at all.
