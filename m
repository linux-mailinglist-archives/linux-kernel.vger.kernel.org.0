Yes, that does make sense. This also allows the L1 hypervisor to
control which hypercalls can be nested.
As for cpuid, what about nested feature discovery such as in
gnttab_need_v2()?
(Though for this particular case, the hypercall should be fine.)

For 3-5, I'd like to prune them to provide a limited hypercall
registration ability -- this is meant to be used for the
xenhost_r0/xenhost_local case.
