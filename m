There's a few things wrong there; I really feel that if we call it nice,
it should be like nice. Otherwise we should call it latency-bias and not
have the association with nice to confuse people.

Secondly; the default should be in the middle of the range. Naturally
this would be a signed range like nice [-(x+1),x] for some x. but if you
want [0,1024], then the default really should be 512, but personally I
like 0 better as a default, in which case we need negative numbers.

This is important because we want to be able to bias towards less
importance to (tail) latency as well as more importantance to (tail)
latency.

Specifically, Oracle wants to sacrifice (some) latency for throughput.
Facebook OTOH seems to want to sacrifice (some) throughput for latency.
