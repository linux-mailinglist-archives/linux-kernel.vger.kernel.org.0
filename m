I agree that lockdep annotations are valuable. My comment was specific
to this one hunk, not all lockdep annotations in your patch. Please
consider my comment in the spirit of patch guidance (per
Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst) noting that all logical
changes should be in separate patches. This specific hunk is unrelated
to the bug being fixed in this patch but can surely be done in a
separate patch submitted together with this fix.

My comment was just specific to the one lockdep annotation added to an
area that was unrelated to the bugfix. I noticed that you removed all
annotations in your new version, that was not my intention. You could
surely keep the lockdep annotation that is in the new code path
introduced in this fix and a separate patch with the other lockdep
annotation would also be welcome (with accurate comment).

Thank you

Reinette
