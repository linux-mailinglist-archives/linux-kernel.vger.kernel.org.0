Agreed, in general we should be moving away from SHA1, but this change
only addresses calculating the boot_aggregate hash, not the bigger
issue of calculating multiple file hashes and extending the TPM banks
with the appropriate file hash values.  The boot_aggregate is the hash
of PCRs 0 - 7, which links the pre-boot event log with the IMA
measurement list.  I would think manufacturing a SHA1 hash collision
in this specific use case scenario would be more difficult.

Assuming changing the boot_aggregate hash algorithm doesn't break
userspace, instead of hard coding the algorithm, we probably should
use the Kconfig IMA_DEFAULT_HASH algorithm.
