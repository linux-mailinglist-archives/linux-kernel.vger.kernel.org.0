The timing of the emulation will be more accurate with 1000.  Of
course, for your purposes that doesn't matter.  Also, the driver will 
probably end up using a higher fraction of the total CPU time.

I really don't know the answer to that.  It seems probable that 100 is
okay and is less likely to lead to overload and stalls than 1000.

Leaving it at 100 should be okay for now.  Especially since we have 
decided to fix this particular problem in an independent way.

In general, I don't know how dummy-hcd will behave when a driver gets 
into a tight retry loop.  In theory, it might end up using so much CPU 
time that you get an rcu stall like the one we saw, but I don't 
understand exactly what happened in this case.  You'd think that with 
no more than six (or however many threads syzbot used) callbacks per 
jiffy, there would be plenty of time for normal threads to run.
