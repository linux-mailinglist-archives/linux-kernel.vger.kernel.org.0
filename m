It is up to Daniel/David to decide. Personally, I agree with you that
either "graphics" or "display" would be better at the admin guide.

Yeah, it is doable. I'm happy to write the rename patches and even try
to split some documents at the places I'm more familiar with, but, IMHO,
we should do some discussions before some of such renames.

For example, Daniel said that:

=46rom the conversions I've made so far, almost all driver subsystems
put everything under Documentation/<subsystem: kAPI, uAPI, admin info,
driver-specific technical info.

It should be doable to place kAPI and uAPI on different books, but there
will be lots of cross-reference links between them, on properly-written
docs.

However, other admin-guide stuff under drivers are usually in the middle
of the documents. For example, on media, we have some at the uAPI guide,
like the Device Naming item:

	https://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis-new/uapi/v4l/open.html#device-n=
aming

But splitting it from uAPI guide is not an easy task.

At the driver's specific documentation is even messier.

Ok, splitting is doable, but require lots of dedication, and I'm not
convinced if it would make much difference in practice.

Thanks,
Mauro
