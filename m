Which is why I have been fixing the issues which the 0day bot finds,
but then I get complaints about reving the patch set to quickly...

Right, which as I already said is why I'm fixing those issues.

In my experience once a patch-set has a maintainers attention,
quickly fixing any issues found usually is the right approach.
Because then usually it can get merged quickly and both the maintainer
and I can move on to other stuff. I'm sorry if you are finding this
annoying.

I am trying to fix this properly, the reason the 0daybot is
complaining is because of pre-existing bugs, not because of issues
with my original patch.

If I was not trying to fix this properly I would have long dropped
this patch to the floor and moved on.

TBH I'm quite unhappy that I'm being "yelled" at now (or so it
feels) while all I'm doing is trying to fix a long standing issue :(

No not ok, I'm doing my best to help make things better here and
in return I'm getting what feels as a bunch of negativity and that
is NOT ok!

Now as how to move forward with this, I suggest that:

1) We wait a bit to see if the 0daybot finds any more existing issues
which are exposed by my patch

2) Change my patch to check for missing symbols to use the approach
which Arvind has suggested

3) Check that "kexec -l <kernel>" + "kexec -e" still work

4) Post v6.

Does that work for you ?

Regards,

Hans
