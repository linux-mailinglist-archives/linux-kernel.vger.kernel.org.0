Ah. FYI, googling "LSDK" gives https://lsdk.github.io as one of the
first hits, and (apart from itself being a github url) that says on the
front page "Disaggregated components of LSDK are available in github.".
But yes, navigating to the Components tab and from there to lsdk linux
one does get directed at codeaurora.

Again, we don't want to run off an NXP kernel, we want to get the
necessary pieces upstream. For now, we have to live with a patched 4.19
kernel, but hopefully by the time we switch to 5.x (for some x >= 5) we
don't need to supply anything other than our own .dts and defconfig.

Thanks, this is exactly what I was hoping for. Even just getting these
first rather trivial patches (in that they don't attempt to build for
ARM, or change functionality at all for PPC) merged for 5.5 would reduce
the amount of out-of-tree patches that we (and NXP for that matter)
would have to carry. I'll take the above as a go-ahead for me to try to
post more patches working towards enabling some of the QE drivers for ARM.
