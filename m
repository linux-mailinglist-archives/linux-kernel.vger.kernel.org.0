Yes. I need to sort that out with Konstantin before the thing gets merged,
but we wanted to give it a wider audience in general.

Yes and no. That's a tricky field. We surely need some agreement with the
reporter/owner, but of course we want as much freedom here as we can
get. The past issues were always a pain when we had the need to get a
particular expert into the group.

Correct.

Yes, we handle that when it happens which is hopefully never.

We already talked to companies and the names should come forth before this
is finished.

I think so. That was written way before that mess happened.
