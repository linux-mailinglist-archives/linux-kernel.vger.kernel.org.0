The ITS driver doesn't care about the fact that an interrupt affinity
is 'managed' or not. And I don't think a low-level driver should, as
it will just follow whatever interrupt affinity it is requested to
use. If a managed interrupt has some requirements, then these
requirements better be explicit in terms of CPU affinity.

Clearly, they aren't your SAS interrupts. But the debug print do not
mean that these are the only interrupts that are targeting
CPU62. Looking at the 62nd column of /proc/interrupts should tell you
what fires (and my bet is on something like the timer).

Clearly, they aren't firing.

OK, we need to get back to what the actual requirements of a 'managed'
interrupt are, because there is clearly something that hasn't made it
into the core code...
