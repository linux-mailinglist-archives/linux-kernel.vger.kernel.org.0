I dont not see that as a soundwire issue. The external dependencies
should be handled as any device would do in Linux kernel with subsystem
specific things for soundwire mechanisms like wake-up


Intel has a big controller with HDA, DSP and Soundwire clubbed together,
I dont think we should burden the susbstem due to hw design

Thanks for sdw_master_device, that is required and fully agreed upon.
What is not agreed is the sdw_master_driver. We do not need that.

As we have discussed your proposal with Greg and aligned (quoting that
here) on following device model for Intel and ARM:

But you have gone ahead and kept the sdw_master_driver which does not fit
into rest of the world except Intel.

I think I am okay with rest of proposal, except this one, so can you
remove this and we can make progress. This issue is lingering since Oct!

We already have a DT driver for soundwire master! We dont need another
layer which does not add value!

these are added to handle intel DSP and sequencing issue, rest of the
world does not have these issues and does not needs them!

Yes these would be required, these can be added in sdw_master_device
too, I dont see them requiring a dummy driver layer..

This does not seem to belong to this patch.

should we not allocate the memory here for master_name?

why do we need master_name if we are setting this here?

who invokes this and when, can you add kernel-doc style documentation to
all APIs exported

why not use runtime_pm apis like pm_runtime_suspended()

If you look at existing headers the documentation is in C files for
APIs, so can you move them over.

When adding stuff please look at the rest of the code as an example.
