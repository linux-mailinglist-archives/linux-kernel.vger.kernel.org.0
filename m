I asked on the github thread if users seeing the problem could check
the new wqueue too big counter:
https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/6326

So far one person is seeing the counter increase when they see the
problem, and another that doesn't see the problem has the counter at
0. Obviously not a great sample size, but hopefully more will report.
If nothing else, someone is seeing the counter increase while trying
to connect to steam.
