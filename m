I'm confused; what are you arguing? The patch as proposed is just wrong,
it needs to go.

That doesn't make sense; even with CONFIG_PREEMPT=n we set
TIF_NEED_RESCHED. We'll just not react to it as promptly (only explicit
rescheduling points and return to userspace). Enabling the tick will not
make any difference what so ever.

Tick based preemption will not 'fix' the lack of wakeup preemption. If
the stop task wakeup didn't set TIF_NEED_RESCHED, the OTHER/CFS tick
will not either.

Right; so clearly we're not understanding what's happening. That seems
like a requirement for actually doing a patch.

Catch the whole thing in a function trace?

The chain that should instantly set TIF_NEED_RESCHED:

  stop_machine()
    stop_machine_cpuslocked()
      stop_cpus()
        __stop_cpus()
          queue_stop_cpus_work()
            cpu_stop_queue_work()
	      wake_up_q()
	        wake_up_process()


  wake_up_process()
    try_to_wake_up()
      ttwu_queue()
        ttwu_queue_remote()
	  <- scheduler_ipi()
	    sched_ttwu_pending()
	      ttwu_do_activate()

        ttwu_do_activate()
	  activate_task()
	  ttwu_do_wakeup()
	    check_preempt_curr()
	      resched_curr()

You could frob some tracing into __stop_cpus(), before
wait_for_completion(), at that point all the CPUs in @cpumask should
either be running the stop task or have TIF_NEED_RESCHED set.
