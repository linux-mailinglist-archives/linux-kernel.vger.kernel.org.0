Just to reiterate -- it would be good if multi_cpu_stop() could
automatically dump out useful information when it has been delayed too
long, where "too long" is probably a bit shorter than the RCU CPU stall
warning timeout.  Useful information would include the stack of the task
impeding multi_cpu_stop().

I hope to have an rcutorture-based repeat-by in a few days, give or take.

Thank you both!
