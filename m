You are working on one specific file, maybe foo.c.  Compile before
making changes, which will give you foo.o.  Rename that file to something
else.  Make your changes and compile again.  Do a diff with the previously
compiled file.  It should produce nothing, indicating no difference.

If this .o file doesn't change and you only changed this .c file, the
whole compiled driver won't change either.

--shortstat does not seem useful.  What you hope to see is that it
produces nothing.
