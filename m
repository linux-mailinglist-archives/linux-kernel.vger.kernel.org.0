Sure, I fully agree and am not a fan of the CMA DT overlays I've seen.

It was really just commentary on commit text as for CMA alone we have
a solution already. I agree on the need for zones.

Avoiding a call from arch code by just having a variable isn't really
better. I'd rather see a common, non DT specific variable that can be
adjusted. Something similar to initrd_start/end. Then the arch code
doesn't have to care what hardware description code adjusted the
value.
