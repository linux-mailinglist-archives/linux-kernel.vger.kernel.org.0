Yes. That's one of the most important and critical parts of syzkaller :)
The tests for different types of bugs are here:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/tree/master/pkg/report/testdata/linux/report

But have 3 for UBSAN, but they may be old and it would be useful to
have 1 example crash per bug type:

syzkaller$ grep UBSAN pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/*
pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/40:TITLE: UBSAN: Undefined behaviour
in drivers/usb/core/devio.c:LINE
pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/40:[    4.556972] UBSAN: Undefined
behaviour in drivers/usb/core/devio.c:1517:25
pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/41:TITLE: UBSAN: Undefined behaviour
in ./arch/x86/include/asm/atomic.h:LINE
pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/41:[    3.805453] UBSAN: Undefined
behaviour in ./arch/x86/include/asm/atomic.h:156:2
pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/42:TITLE: UBSAN: Undefined behaviour
in kernel/time/hrtimer.c:LINE
pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/42:[   50.583499] UBSAN: Undefined
behaviour in kernel/time/hrtimer.c:310:16

One of them is incomplete and is parsed as "corrupted kernel output"
(won't be reported):
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/pkg/report/testdata/linux/report/42

Also I see that report parsing just takes the first line, which
includes file name, which is suboptimal (too long, can't report 2 bugs
in the same file). We seem to converge on "bug-type in function-name"
format.
The thing about bug titles is that it's harder to change them later.
If syzbot already reported 100 bugs and we change titles, it will
start re-reporting the old one after new names and the old ones will
look stale, yet they still relevant, just detected under different
name.
So we also need to get this part right before enabling.

Yes, panic_on_warn we also need.

I will look at the patches again for Acked-by.
