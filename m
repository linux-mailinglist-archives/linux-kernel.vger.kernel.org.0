This is a critical bug which breaks memory hotplug, since KASLR is
enabled by default in upstream, and in our distros too. You can see that
Junichi posted the patch after NEC must have tested the code and found
the new issue. And Chao from FJ also worked out the patches to fix the bug. 
And I have tracking  bugs at hand from other important customers, related
to this fix too. The back porting of Chao's patches into our distros are
blocked by these two. We gonna miss another due date we promised to customers.

Thanks
Baoquan
