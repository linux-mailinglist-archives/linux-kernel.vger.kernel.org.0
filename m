... as a _result_ of a discussion and deciding not to upstream it,
but to still allow its use.  Fastfpe is faster than nwfpe (so has
a definite advantage for FP intensive applications) but we decided
we didn't want two FP emulation codes in the kernel.  However, if
someone wants to use it, it has to be built into the kernel, it
can't be modular.
