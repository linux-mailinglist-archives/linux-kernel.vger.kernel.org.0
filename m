In general I think we're already pretty good at adding and accumulating
documentation, but not so much cleaning up existing and outright
throwing out obsolete documentation.

'wc -l Documentation/process/*' says we already have 11k lines of
generic process documentation.

I would much rather see a streamlined and friendly guide to contributing
to the kernel than more rules, and driver/subsystem specific rules at
that. I would much rather get the feeling from submissions that the long
tail of contributors have actually read and understood the most relevant
parts of Documentation/process.

I'm pretty sure *I* haven't read all of Documentation/process.

My fear is that the entry profiles will only be helpful to the
contributors that already "get it". It may be helpful to the maintainers
in the sense that they can reply to patches with a pointer to the
relevant hoops to jump through.

---

Even so, if this gets merged, I'll probably add something helpful for
drm and/or i915 contributors. But what's the buy-in across the kernel?
If my grep serves me right, there are something like 2000+ entries in
MAINTAINERS. If 10% of them adds a profile, that's a fairly serious
amount of documentation. But can you actually expect more than a handful
of subsystems/drivers to add a profile? Then what's the coverage?

For reference, I've added or promoted adding the B: and C: entries to
MAINTAINERS. Various subsystems and drivers are really picky about where
and how they want bugs reported; in particular some folks only accept
email. Yet networking is the only one to indicate the email preference
in MAINTAINERS. And adding that is a one line change. (There are 19 B:
entries and 7 C: entries in total.)
