What is this backtrace for? It's completly useless as it merily shows
that the warning triggers. Also even if it'd be useful then it wants to
be trimmed properly.

Believe is not really relevant in engineering.

The problem has nothing to do with virt or bare metal. It's a genuine
issue.

There's lots of 'we' in that text. We do nothing really. Please describe
things in neutral and factual language.

Also there is another way to trigger this: Offline all non-isolated CPUs
in the mask and then bring one online again.

Ming, I really have to ask why these two situations were not tested
before the final submission of that isolation patch. Both issues have
been discussed during review of the different versions. So the warning
should have triggered back then already....

While the comment is not longer correct, removing it is lame. This
should have an explanation why managed interrupts can end up here.

No need to resend. I fixed it up already.

Thanks,
