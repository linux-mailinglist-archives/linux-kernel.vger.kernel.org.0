I doubt you'd have pre-built distribution kernels with kmemleak enabled.

We had a similar situation with the early log buffer (before slab is
initialised), initially 400 which was good enough for my needs (embedded
systems) but others had entirely different requirements. A configurable
(cmdline, Kconfig) option would make it easier for people to change,
especially if coupled with a meaningful suggestion in dmesg.

Another option is to use the early log as an emergency pool after
initialisation instead of freeing it (it's currently __initdata) and
drop the mempool idea. I may give this a go, at least we only have a
single Kconfig option.
