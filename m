Hi Takashi,
I think I understand. That might work, but it would definitely require
my other patch in v2. The contributing factors to that are:
1. The count of widgets coming out of snd_hdac_get_sub_nodes() can change.
2. hda_widget_sysfs_init() races with at least one (and in my head I
just make it multiple) calls to snd_hdac_refresh_widgets().
3. codec->{num_nodes, start_nid, widgets} are all essentially one data
structure that needs to be protected.

Without my other patch in v2 [1], num_nodes and start_nid are not
updated at the same time as the widgets array.

The patch you suggest may work as long as the lock surrounds all of 1)
the read in snd_hdac_get_sub_nodes(), 2) the updating of widgets
array, and 3) updating start_nid, num_nodes.

However, by doing it the way you suggest we're effectively saying "if
codec->widgets doesn't exist, then reinit does nothing". I worry that
a future caller might try to do something that requires the widgets to
have actually been refreshed after calling refresh_widgets(), but end
up crashing because they had won the race against sysfs_init(), and
refresh_widgets() did nothing except set codec->num_nodes. Which seems
weird, you'd expect a function named refresh_widgets() would keep the
whole data structure consistent, and that sysfs_reinit() would return
having actually re-initialized sysfs. I was trying to preserve those
semantics with my patch, rather than introduce an implicit ordering
dependency between refresh_widgets() and sysfs_init().

Ok. Please do consider the other patch in that series [1], as I
believe it is needed no matter which way we do this patch.
