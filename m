And actually work on cases you previously called academic and which now
matter to you because your employer has a suddent interest in SEV.
Academic really is in the eye of the beholder (and of those who pay
the bills).

And the only thing we need to support the fault handler is to add an
offset to the dma_mmap_* APIs.  Which I had planned to do for Christian
(one of the few grapics developers who actually tries to play well
with the rest of the kernel instead of piling hacks over hacks like
many others) anyway, but which hasn't happened yet.

This is pretty demanding.  If you "need" a way forward just work with
all the relevant people instead of piling ob local hacks.
