But the problem does not exist in the current kernel as yet till the reworked
versions of the other two patches in this series get merged. This patch was
after arm64 hot-remove enablement in V1 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/3/28)
but after some discussions it was decided to be moved before hot-remove from
V2 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/14/5) onwards as a prerequisite patch instead.

It was deliberate for 5.3 as a preparation for upcoming reworked arm64 hot-remove.
