Really, it's a chicken & egg thing. If people who make userspaces
never have an option to design around the correct behavior, they'll
continue to rely on the broken behavior. But if we give them a way to
compile their kernels with the correct behavior, eventually some
userspaces will run fine with it. "But they should just use
getrandom()!" you shout. Yes, and maybe the code most userspace
builders provide does do this. But people like to plug-in plenty of
third party things into their userspaces, and I think there's some
value in a userspace being able to say, "we've dealt with the
/dev/urandom situation, and we now do the right thing, so we can
enable this option, and now the code you run on our userspace will
give good randomness."

More concretely, distros might ship an init system that allows
enabling this option without creating issues. Systemd might improve.
OpenRC and runit-based distros appear to exist. Some folks do very
custom stuff. If they manage to make it work with the correct urandom
behavior, then that's a good situation for everything else to build
on, and for providing better guarantees for third party software that
runs on that distro. But none of this is possible without the ability
to compile the kernel with the correct behavior.
