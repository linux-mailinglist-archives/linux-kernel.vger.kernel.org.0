Hardware security modules, such as nCipher’s Solo products, retain key material (i.e. secrets) within the secure boundary of the device, and implement various forms of access control to restrict use of that key material.

So this should tie into the correct crypto/key apis that the kernel has
and not create a brand new user/kernel api, right?

Please work with the crypto kernel developers to get this right, I can't
take this until they agree that this code and api is correct.
