Those could be due to the configuration selected by HW and SW cannot 
override them, so traditionally we have never polled for CLK_OFF for 
these clocks.

The USB phy is managed by the USB driver and clock driver is not aware 
if USB driver models the phy as a clock. Thus we do want to keep a 
dependency on the parent and not poll for CLK_ENABLE.

Even if I write these registers during probe, the late init check 
'clk_core_is_enabled' would return true and would be turned OFF, that is 
the reason for marking them CRITICAL.
