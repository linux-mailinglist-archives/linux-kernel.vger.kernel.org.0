I mentioned this in the commit log, but maybe I wasn't very clear:

Basically, there are calls of native_write_cr4() made very early in
secondary CPU init that would hit the "eek missing bit" case, and using
the cr4_init_shadow() trick mentioned by Linus still wasn't early
enough. So, since feature detection for these bits is "done" (i.e.
secondary CPUs will match the boot CPU's for these bits), it's safe to
set them "early". To avoid this, we'd need a per-cpu "am I ready to set
these bits?" state, and it'd need to be read-only-after-init, which is
not a section that exists and seems wasteful to create (4095 bytes
unused) for this feature alone.

Yup, that's actually exactly what I had tried. Should I try to track down
the very early callers and OR in the bits at the call sites instead? (This
had occurred to me also, but it seemed operationally equivalent to ORing
at the start of native_write_cr4(), so I didn't even bother trying it).
