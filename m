I hope you mean "not realistic", at least when it comes to explicit
preempt/irq disabling rather than spinlock variants that don't disable
preempt/irqs on PREEMPT_RT.

The defer_qs_iw_pending stuff isn't in 5.2-rt.  Still, given patch 4/5 (and
special.b.deferred_qs on mainline) this shouldn't present a deadlock concern
(letting the test run a bit now to double check) so this patch could
probably be limited to the "example #1" sequence.

rcutorture crashes on RT without this patch (in particular due to the
local_bh_disable misordering).
