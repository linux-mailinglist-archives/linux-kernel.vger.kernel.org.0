Shouldn't we do tty_port_link_device() before uart_add_one_port() to
remove that race?  Once you register the console, yes, tty_open() can
happen, so the driver had better be ready to go at that point in time.

This feels like it should be fixed by the caller, not in the tty core.
Any reason that can not happen?
