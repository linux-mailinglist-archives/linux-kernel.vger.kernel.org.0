I believe it would be nice to have them for all pin descriptions, but
having them
for the peripherals that only have one muxing option probably wouldn't have any
effect, as they would be set and referenced by default in the dtsi.

> But how does this play along with overlays? Shouldn't at least those interface pins that are exposed on headers stay in each .dtb? Can we actually make this decision in the SoC .dtsi file?

In upstream dtc, I sent a patch to make it ignore the flag if you
compile the dts
with overlay support, i.e. with the -@ flag.

> And should there be a dtc command line option to ignore those tags, or even to apply this tag (virtually) to every node?

That would probably end up trimming peripherals out, even enabled ones?
