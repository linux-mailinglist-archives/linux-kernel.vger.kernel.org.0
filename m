It's bounded by the amount left unused from the previous period. So
theoretically a process could use almost twice its quota. But then it
would have nothing left over in the next period. To repeat it would have
to not use any that next period. Over a longer number of periods it's the
same amount of CPU usage.

I think that is more fair than throttling a process that has never used
its full quota.

And it removes complexity.
