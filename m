See my other mail. This is mostly to not touch MMIO pages and=20
ZONE_DEVICE pages ... well and /dev/mem mapped pages.

If you can't offline memory with holes, you can also not online memory=20
with holes AFAIKS :)

Bootmem is online, and memory you can hotplug (initially offline) cannot=20
have any holes.
