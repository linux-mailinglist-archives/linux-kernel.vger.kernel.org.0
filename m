I don't mean the buffer clks, but the XO resource specifically. It's the
representation to the RPM that deep sleep/deep idle should or shouldn't
turn off XO and achieve "XO shutdown". Basically it can never be off
when the CPU is active because then the CPU itself wouldn't be clocked,
but when the CPU isn't active we may want to turn it off if nothing is
using it during sleep to clock some sort of wakeup logic or device that
is active when the CPU is idle.

Cool. Yeah seems better to just indicate that the reference clks are
clocked by something else and fix that problem now.
