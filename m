Don't we get a set of segments with the regular kexec syscall? These could equally be
hashed and measured, and logged via IMA and/or extending the TPMs measurements.

(obviously this would include the command-line and maybe purgatory, which makes it less
predictable, but these are still the binary blobs that were given privileged access to the
system).

Hmm, this is why the reserved memory gets freed.

What happens to stuff that happens between kexec-load and boot?
There is a comment:
| /* segment size can't change between kexec load and execute */

But I can't see anywhere that enforces that. I guess those measurements will go missing,
and the TPM value will not match after kexec.



Thanks,

James
