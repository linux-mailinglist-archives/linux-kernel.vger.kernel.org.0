Yep.  More specifically, the EPCM is consulted if and only if the access
is allowed by the page tables.

I agree on ignoring SECINFO.

If we do literally nothing, then I'm pretty sure mapping an enclave will
require PROCESS__EXECMEM.  The mmap() for the actual enclave is done
using an anon inode, e.g. from /dev/sgx/enclave.  Anon inodes are marked
private, which means inode_has_perm() will always return "success".  The
only effective check is in file_map_prot_check() when default_noexec is
true, in which case requesting PROT_EXEC on private inodes requires
PROCESS__EXECMEM.

Rather the do surgery on SELinux, why not go with Cedric's original
proposal and propagate the permissions from the source VMA to the EPC
VMA?  The enclave mmap() from userspace could then be done with RO
permissions so as to not run afoul of LSMs.  Adding PROT_EXEC after
EADD would require PROCESS__EXECMEM, but that's in line with mprotect()
on regular memory.  It also punts the EMODPE hiccup to userspace, e.g.
any enclave that wants to do fancy things with PROT_EXEC needs
PROCESS__EXECMEM.

The only downside I see is that SGX would be doing a bit of magic with
enclave VMAs.

No?  I don't understand why you want to special case enclaves from an
LSM perspective.  Enforcing LSM policies on the source provides the
same security for enclaves as it does for normal code, no more, no less.
