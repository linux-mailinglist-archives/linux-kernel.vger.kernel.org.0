Right, we've done that since roughly forever in copy_thread():

int copy_thread(unsigned long clone_flags, unsigned long usp,
		unsigned long kthread_arg, struct task_struct *p)
{
	...
	/* Copy registers */
	sp -= sizeof(struct pt_regs);
	childregs = (struct pt_regs *) sp;
	if (unlikely(p->flags & PF_KTHREAD)) {
		/* kernel thread */
		memset(childregs, 0, sizeof(struct pt_regs));
		childregs->gpr[1] = sp + sizeof(struct pt_regs);
                ...
		p->thread.regs = NULL;	/* no user register state */

We have the regs on the stack too (see above), but we're explicitly
NULL'ing the link from task->thread.

Looks like on arm64 and x86 there is no link from task->thread, instead
you get from task to pt_regs via task_stack_page().

That actually seems potentially fishy given the comment on
task_stack_page() about the stack going away for exiting tasks. We
should probably be NULL'ing the regs pointer in free_thread_stack() or
similar. Though that race mustn't be happening because other arches
would see it.

Or are we just wrong and kthreads should have non-NULL regs? I can't
find another arch that does the same as us.

cheers
