Well, that's an unexpected turn.  I'm not disagreeing with that decision
but since my initial pull request was done one year ago (almost to the
day!), it's a bit disappointing to see that in the end I'm back to
square one :-)

I guess that the PR I mentioned in the cover letter can also be dropped,
as it's not really usable by the kernel client (at least not until it
fully supports all the features up to SERVER_OCTOPUS).

Anyway, thanks everyone for the review.

Cheers,
