FWIW reboot problems on RK3399 have been tracked down to issues in 
upstream ATF, and are unrelated to the PMIC.

As mentioned elsewhere[1], although this is what the BSP kernel seems to 
do, and in practice it's unlikely to matter for the majority of devboard 
users like you and me, I still feel a bit uncomfortable with this 
solution for systems using ATF as in principle the secure world might 
want to know about orderly shutdowns, and this effectively makes every 
shutdown an unexpected power loss from secure software's point of view.
