Thanks very much for the confirmation.

Thanks the hint, At the beginning, I noticed that we don't have
DOMAIN_ATTR_DMA_USE_FLUSH_QUEUE, thus I thought flush_iotlb_all is
unnecessary.

After grep, iommu_flush_tlb_all also is called in the x_direct_mapping,
then we still need this.

If putting it in a new patch(switch flush_iotlb_all to
mtk_iommu_tlb_flush_all), then the Fixes tag(commit id: 4d689b619445) is
needed?
