Hmmm, sorry about that. Here is what I propose as a changelog:

---
rbtree: avoid generating code twice for the cached versions (tools copy)

As was already noted in rbtree.h, the logic to cache rb_first (or rb_last)
can easily be implemented externally to the core rbtree api.

This commit takes the changes applied to the include/linux/ and lib/
rbtree files in commit 9f973cb38088, and applies these to the
tools/include/linux/ and tools/lib/ files as well to keep them synchronized.

The files are not a straight copy, but are very close. I opened the
tools/include/linux rbtree files, cut out the parts that were modified
in commit 9f973cb38088, then pasted the corresponding replacements
from that commit. Then I diffed the exported commits against each
other for a sanity check - they differ only in their context and in
irrelevant detail (for example whether some removed function had some
EXPORT_SYMBOL on them).
