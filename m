I'll take this as an opportunity to learn something: what would cause
the task state to be set to running other than a the waited for event
or the timeout?

That's the bog standard mainline kernel behavior for the sugov kthread.
The comments in the code say this is done to be able to preempt all
other tasks as to not delay the frequency switching. There's quite a
bit of special casing of the sugov task with SCHED_FLAG_SUGOV in the
deadline scheduler code. This flag isn't carried over to the boosted
thread, maybe that's an issue?

But even if we hit throttling I would have expected the situation to
clear after some time. That's not what I'm seeing: once the user task
is stuck, it's stuck for hours. I would say indefinitely, but it's hard
to empirically prove that. ;)

> Perhaps put in some trace_printk()s and see what exactly is happening.

My hope was that someone would could guide me a little with an educated
guess, to make those trace_printks more helpful. The lockup is hard to
trigger and there's other unrelated system activity going on, even when
the relevant user task is stuck, so randomly sprinkling debug
statements will generate lots of output to filter down.

Lucas
