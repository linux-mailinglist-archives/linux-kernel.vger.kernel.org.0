Thank you for pointing this out, I was not aware of it. I understand that you
are against "#ifdeffery" in this case, but isn't it the case of adding at least
__maybe_unused? This would prevent people from reporting it over and over again
and you to have to push them back :) Let me know what do you think, in case I am
happy to change my patch accordingly.
