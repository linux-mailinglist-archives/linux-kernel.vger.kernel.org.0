This is incorrect: the fallback allocation here is only if the initial 
allocation with __GFP_THISNODE fails.  In that case, we were able to 
compact memory to make a local hugepage available without incurring 
excessive swap based on the RFC patch that appears as patch 3 in this 
series.  I very much believe your usecase would benefit from this as well 
(or at least not cause others to regress).  We *want* remote thp if they 
are immediately available but only after we have tried to allocate locally 
from the initial allocation and allowed memory compaction fail first.

Likely there can be discussion around the fourth patch of this series to 
get exactly the right policy.  We can construct it as necessary for 
hugetlbfs to not have any change in behavior, that's simple.  We could 
also check per-zone watermarks in mm/huge_memory.c to determine if local 
memory is low-on-memory and, if so, allow remote allocation.  In that case 
it's certainly better to allocate remotely when we'd be reclaiming locally 
even for fallback native pages.

I haven't seen such a patch series, is there a link?
