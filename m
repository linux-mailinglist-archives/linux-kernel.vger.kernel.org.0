Ok, let me retry if necessary (but I do remember I end up with deadlocks 
last try).

Can this synchronize_rcu() be triggered by guest? If yes, there are 
several other MMU notifiers that can block. Is vhost something special here?

The current synchronize_rcu()  can force a expedited grace period:

void synchronize_rcu(void)
{
         ...
         if (rcu_blocking_is_gp())
return;
         if (rcu_gp_is_expedited())
synchronize_rcu_expedited();
else
wait_rcu_gp(call_rcu);
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(synchronize_rcu);

No faster but no IPI.

Yes, that's possible but should be done on top.

Thanks
