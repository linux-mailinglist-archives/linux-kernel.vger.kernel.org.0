Hi Boris,

Thank you for your kind code review. Please find my comments inline.

OK. I got it. rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts,printf}().

Actually this fix covers all the cases of an audit of the calling paths
of rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts,printf}(), to make sure we only have the
lockdep_assert_held() in places where we are sure that it must be held.
Please find more background details as below.

I would like to provide more of the background details in the commit
comment in v2 patch:

-------------------
x86/resctrl: Fix potential lockdep warning

rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts,printf}() call lockdep_assert_held() to assert
that rdtgroup_mutex is held.

During internal review of some other changes we found that there are
code paths that call rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts}() when the rdtgroup_mutex
is not held.

An audit of calling sequences identified two different cases in
rdtgroup_kn_lock_live() which both returning NULL:
1.'rdtgrp' returned from kernfs_to_rdtgroup() is NULL, rdtgroup_mutex
is not held.
2.'rdtgrp' is being deleted, rdtgroup_mutex is held.

Checking all call sites of rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts,printf}() found two
code paths where rdtgroup_mutex is not held: rdtgroup_cpus_write() and
mkdir_rdt_prepare().

Fix by removing rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts}() in these two paths. Just
returning error should be sufficient to report to the user that the
entry doesn't exist any more.
