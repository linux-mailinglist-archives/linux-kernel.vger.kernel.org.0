Since I have a few kernel repos that I use for both upstream work and
work targeting AOSP trees, I usually have the gerrit commit hook
enabled in my tree (its easier to strip with sed then it is to re-add
after submitting to gerrit), and at least the commit-msg hook I have
will usually append a Change-Id: line at the end of the commit
message, usually after the signed-off-by line.

Even in the example in the README from:
  https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/android-mainline
shows how one might have the change-id and other AOSP tags added after
the existing sob-chain. So it doesn't seem to be that rare.

Some other examples from the android-mainline tree:
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/5fba1b18cfc72e264e5f3ce49020ed322aa6ac9f

Suggestions for a better approach? I can't say I'm very familiar with
checkpatch's code.

So, I try to add Sign-off-by to all the patches I send as it certifies
that I wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an
open-source patch - not as "ok to merge" criteria.

More vendor code then I'd like is usually not intended to be merged
upstream, but it's still important that folks sign off their patches.
