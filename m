Yes.

600+ bytes is a bit much.  I guess it's OK in this situation.

This is not exactly a thing of beauty :( Presumably there might still
be situations where the irq-off times remain excessive.

Why are we actually holding zone->lock so much?  Can we get away with
holding it across the list_for_each() loop and nothing else?  If so,
this still isn't a bulletproof fix.  Maybe just terminate the list
walk if freecount reaches 1024.  Would anyone really care?

Sigh.  I wonder if anyone really uses this thing for anything
important.  Can we just remove it all?
