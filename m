So what your asking is that only domain experts are to review
patches in the subsystems you maintain.  That's absurd, and among the
least inclusive statements I've heard in a while.  No wonder we have
an issue attracting new reviewers/maintainers to the fray.

At the moment, your assertion isn't based on the documented meaning.
So you're enforcing rules based on what you think it should mean,
rather than what it actually means (according to the current
and up-to-date documentation).

That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it.  But frankly that's
all it is at the moment.  If you wish to push this meaning onto
others, you need to start a conversation and/or submit patches for
review.

What is an empty {Acked,Reviewed}-by?  We have no provision for
indicating time taken to review.  As maintainers we have to make the
call on how many 'credits' to award the {Acked,Reviewed}-by based on
our experiences of that person.  I have reviewers I trust and
reviewers who are new to me.  My trust levels of a patch increase a
given amount depending on who they are and how many I receive.  That
level is seldom zero though!

Yes, that's bad.

Don't forget these reviewers you speak of, they are only "unknown" to
you.  They will have; friends, co-workers, employers, potential
employers, community colleagues, etc.  Their interest in a patch,
driver or sub-system may not be known to you, but may be intrinsic to
their role else where.  Who are you (we) to decide who is unimportant
when it comes to our areas of responsibility?  Or who should and
should not gain credit for their efforts?

It's about given credit where credit is due.

There is no such thing as an empty {Acked,Reviewed}-by - you made that
up.  Unless someone is gaming the Git statistics and giving out *-bys
willy-nilly, it means they have put some effort into reviewing a
patch.

Cheapens the headers?  Total nonsense!  Any review, even by non-domain
experts only serves to strengthen the likelihood that the patch is of
the required quality.

I'm sorry to say, but I find your views dated, elitist and arrogant.

Agreed.  Late reviews are generally not credited.

No, you don't know.  You can never know.  That's why you have to give
the benefit of the doubt in most cases.  How much credit you actually
give to the review is your decision as the maintainer - it should not
be your decision to dismiss it completely based on your (our)
ignorance of who this person might be.

Actually my SoBs would have been more important, but that's by the
by.

Granted, some (not all, not most, not even many) people write lots of
trivial patches, submit reviews which have not been thought out
properly, game Git statistics, etc.  They should be dealt with in the
appropriate manor.  However until proven guilty, reviewers should be
guided and encouraged to do continue doing so.  These are our future
maintainers and should be nurtured.  You absolutely should not ignore
their efforts.  Doing so will only make them feel undervalued and will
likely discourage them from further contributions.

That's not a question of developer history.  If you'd conducted your
due diligence on me (just using this patch as an example), you would
have seen that I have a solid 'developer history'.  What you're
judging on is your own opinion based on your experiences alone.  As I
said before, people shouldn't be ignored/discouraged based on our
ignorance of their existence.

Deciding not to apply a *-by because you have no way to gauge the
level quality of the review, due solely to a gap in your own knowledge
is an awful policy.

This discussion is starting to take up a lot of my time now, so I'd
like it to come to a close.  I guess the summary is; if you wish to
continue being; discouraging, exclusive and elitist, you continue
doing things your way.  If you wish other contributors to adhere to
your meanings of the various *-by tags, you'll have to conduct a
discussion and update the documentation accordingly.  I'd certainly be
happy to change the way I use them, but only if reflected clearly in
the documentation.

Have a lovely day Ted.
