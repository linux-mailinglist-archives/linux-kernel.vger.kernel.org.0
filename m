Ok, so, this is not a problem.

I hope that such patch is not going to be part of mainline kernel as it
would break lot of things. UEFI Secure Boot and kernel lock down are two
different things. It would be really suspicious that for "workarounding"
broken functionality would be needed to turn of totally unrelated option
in firmware SETUP.

The following question is up to the hwmon maintainers. Guenter, should
we start creating whilelist of machines which support those SMM calls
for enabling / disabling BIOS auto mode? And maintaining this whilelist
in kernel dell-smm-hwmon driver?

I mean protection to disallow calling SET_FAN operation when auto mode
is enabled.
