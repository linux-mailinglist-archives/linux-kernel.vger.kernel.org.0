When using the netlink interface you get the NBD_CMD_LINK_DEAD first
then the configs_refs goes to zero right?

nbd_disconnect_and_put -> sock_shutdown -> nbd_mark_nsock_dead

then later we do the final nbd_config_put?

Maybe it would be best to add a new netlink event to signal what has
happened, because the above nl and stat algorithm seems like a pain. The
NBD_CMD_LINK_DEAD will be sent, then userspace has to possibly poll the
status to check if this was caused due to nbd_genl_disconnect instead of
a downed link due to something like a command timeout, because the
refcount may not be down when userspace gets the NL event.

Or, I guess the admin/tool process could just send a msg to the daemon
process to tell it to do the netlink disconnect request.
