That's not really a limitation. I should probably not have mentioned as it it seems to
have made things even more unclear. I disabled HS400 before introducing the new tuning on
purpose. Any comment regarding hs400 does not belong in patch 7 IHMO. If you want
to add comment regarding hs400, I think it belongs here

Thanks for effort but all this just maintain the blur around HS400 on amlogic.

Let me rephrase it:
Tuning (phase or resampling) is meant to compensate the clock round trip in UHS
and HS200 modes. In HS400, this should be taken care of by the data strobe.
But we have not been to enable this reliably enable this on amlogic chipset ...

... and I believe we are back to the original commit message.

That's my understanding of the hs400 problem.
