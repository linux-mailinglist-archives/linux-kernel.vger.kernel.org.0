 Mount options

   This option overrides the security measure restricting file access
   to the user mounting the filesystem.  This option is by default only
   allowed to root, but this restriction can be removed with a
   (userspace) configuration option.
 
-'max_read=N'
-
+**max_read=N**
   With this option the maximum size of read operations can be set.
