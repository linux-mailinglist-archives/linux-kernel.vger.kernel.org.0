So it's not switching with the clock, the circuit somehow keeps the
switch latched?

It does feel like it might be simpler to just handle this as a quirk in
the PHY or ethernet driver, this feels like an awful lot of work to
add a sleep on what's probably only going to ever be one system.

Hopefully not a *lot* of duplication.  The GPIOs are handled in the core
because they're really common and used by many regulator devices, the
same will I hope not be true for clocks.

I guess my question here is what the trip through the regulator API buys
us - it's a bit of a sledgehammer to crack a nut thing.
