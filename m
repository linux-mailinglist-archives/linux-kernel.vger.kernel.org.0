Subject: [PATCH] uapi: Add the BSD-2-Clause license to ndctl.h
Date:   Fri, 25 Oct 2019 10:55:53 -0700

Allow ndctl.h to be licensed with BSD-2-Clause so that other
operating systems can provide the same user level interface.
---

I've been working on nvdimm support in FreeBSD and would like to
offer the same ndctl API there to ease porting of application
code. Here I'm proposing to add the BSD-2-Clause license to this
header file, so that it can later be copied into FreeBSD.

I believe that all the authors of changes to this file (in the To:
list) would need to agree to this change before it could be
accepted, so any signed-off-by is intentionally ommited for now.
Thanks,

Scott
