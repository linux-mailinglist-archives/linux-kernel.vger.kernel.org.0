Indeed :-/

At least I can report that I was able to reproduce a probable variant of 
the bug Tetsuo reported on a regular PC as well, with this command:

  dd if=/dev/mem of=/dev/null status=progress conv=noerror bs=100M

The 'noerror' is needed to skip unreadable holes early in the memory map.

What I noticed is that while reading regular RAM is reasonably fast even 
in very large chunks, accesses become very slow once they hit iomem - and 
delays even longer than the reported 145 seconds become possible if 
bs=100M is increased to say bs=1000M.

With your patch applied these large read chunks are still possible and 
not interruptible within read_mem(), and because the source of the 
slowdown is the iomem access and memcpy()s, not the paging overhead, the 
new page fault code doesn't even trigger and the delays remain.

I.e. this hypothesis is not true, on my testbox at least - and with my 
different testcase:

With Tetsuo's approach the delays are fixed, because the fatal signal is 
noticed within the 4K chunks of read_mem() immediately:

[pid  1674] 1566662105.052485 write(1, "ZZZZ\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 104857600) = 104857600 <0.000008>
[pid  1674] 1566662105.052512 read(0, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 104857600) = 104857600 <17.006740>
[pid  1674] 1566662122.059306 write(1, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 104857600) = 104857600 <0.000009>

[pid  1674] 1566662122.059372 write(2, "3145728000 bytes (3.1 GB) copied", 323145728000 bytes (3.1 GB) copied) = 32 <0.000009>
[pid  1674] 1566662122.059411 write(2, ", 18.214699 s, 173 MB/s", 23, 18.214699 s, 173 MB/s) = 23 <0.000008>

[pid  1674] 1566662123.082491 +++ killed by SIGKILL +++

Note how the first 100MB chunk took 17 seconds, the second chunk was 
interrupted within ~2 seconds after I sent a SIGKILL.

Find below a variant of Tetsuo's patch, that uses a more regular signal 
return pattern that you suggested in your other mail:

Except that I think the regular pattern here is not 'break' but 'goto 
failed' - 'break' would just result in a partial read and 'err' gets 
ignored.

I also agree that we should probably allow regular interrupts to 
interrupt /dev/mem accesses - while the 'dd' process is killable, it's 
not Ctrl-C-able.

If I change the fatal_signal_pending() to signal_pending() it all behaves 
much better IMHO - assuming that no utility learned rely on 
non-interruptibility ...

The second patch is attached below the first one.

Independently of this I also agree with Tetsuo that a cond_resched() 
might be in order to break up this loop on non-preempt kernels. The third 
patch below implements this variant.

Is this closer to what you had in mind?

Thanks,

	Ingo
