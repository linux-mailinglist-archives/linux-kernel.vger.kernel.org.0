OK...  BTW, I'd been trying to recall the reasons for the way
__futex_atomic_op2() loop is done; ISTR some discussion along
the lines of cacheline ping-pong prevention, but I'd been unable
to reconstruct enough details to find it and I'm not sure it
hadn't been about some other code ;-/

What we have there (fault handling aside) is
loop:	eax = *uaddr;
	v = eax | oparg;
	lock cmpxchg v, *uaddr
	if (!zf)
		goto loop;
	oldval = eax;
Why do we bother with reload?  That cmpxchg is, after all,
	t = *uaddr;
	zf = (t == eax);
	*uaddr = zf ? v : t;
	eax = t;
so what would be wrong with doing
	eax = *uaddr;
loop:	v = eax | oparg;
	lock cmpxchg v, *uaddr
	if (!zf)
		goto loop;
	oldval = eax;
instead?
