Are you sure it is not working? -EPROBE_DEFER is normal(ish) it just means
that the i2c-controller driver for the bus has not initialized yet.

If you are building the i2c_designware or acpi_lpss drivers as module, or i=
f
you are building the intel_cht_int33fe code into the kernel, then this
is more or less expected to happen.

You can do "ls /sys/bus/i2c/devices" to check if it did succeed on
later re-probe attempts (the fuel-gauge device should be there if
things succeeded).

And you should probably do one more version, suppressing the dev_err
on -EPROBE_DEFER like e.g. this snippet from the typec code:

         if (fusb302_irq < 0) {
                 if (fusb302_irq !=3D -EPROBE_DEFER)
                         dev_err(dev, "Error getting FUSB302 irq\n");
                 return fusb302_irq;
         }

Regards,

Hans
