Sure, its not a trivial change, but I still think it would be superior to try and get it
right.Â  But I certainly have no more influence than the prior sentence.

I see this as unfortunate, and a propagation of a weak original design which stems from a
time when inline C functions were not even available.

  If serial8250_set_IER() function returned the prior value, it could be saved on the stack and still be an indication of difference from the current hardware for the temporary situation at hand.

Then, the compiler would have had a better chance of optimizing out the return value when it is not needed, because it would be a mere reading of the prior value from the struct.

I know I expressed some concern about using *3* functions, set, clear, and restore before, when 2 might suffice.  However we've seen other situations where a clear and restore are used, such as interrupt flags.
( "set" is a mere lower level common gateway to the hardware in our context.)  So down the road, a clear() and restore() may give you the option to do some locking and unlocking, which I know you don't currently think you need.  Pardon me for un-weighting my concern for 3 functions.

It is certainly a major improvement.  To be honest, I will probably simply comment out the console support in the inline function when and if I ever upgrade my code. I like that its inline, and that its in a single function.
