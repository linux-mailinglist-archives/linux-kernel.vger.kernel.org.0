What required bits would that be? The pointer to the fgraph_ops,
because we need that to pass to the calling function.

When we hit a fgraph_ops, how do we know if it was freed or not? We
can't just blindly reference it.

The idea of the array, is that we can maintain state in a single
location of when the fgraph_ops is freed. If we return from a function,
we have an index and a counter, and if the counter doesn't match with
what's in the array, then we know that the fgraph_ops is no longer
around and we just drop it.

The reason for the array, is to keep track of if the fgraph_ops has
been freed or not. Otherwise, when we unregister the fgraph_ops, we
would need to search all shadow stacks, looking for it to unreference
it.

Believe me, I rather not have that array, but I couldn't come up with a
better solution to handle freeing of fgraph_ops.
