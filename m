It's something generic that should be handled by the core iirc. We
might be missing the few things to enable it though, but that's
irrelevant to the DT itself.

If a node doesn't have a phandle pointing to it, it will be ignored at
compilation time.

I know I did it for libfdt at some point, so I guess dtc would work
too, but I'm not really sure. Rockchip is also using it iirc, so
there's interest in supporting it in U-Boot anyway.

Pin groups will take a lot of space in the dtb, and the DT parsing
will take some measurable time, so if we can get rid of the unused pin
groups, that's great :)

If the DT is compiled with overlays, that property is ignored iirc and
the node will be output in the compiled DT, because while if you don't
have overlays support you can tell if something points to that node,
you can't with overlays since those references might be stored
elsewhere.

Most of the nodes are (reference) leaves in a DT though. Pretty much
all the device nodes have no references pointing to them, just like
most of the buses, the CPU nodes, etc. And I'm pretty sure you want to
keep them :)
