Fine by me.

You need to add a comment for this.

In this case you must check first that both set and get are supported.

You only checked that the operation can be done, you cannot know in
advance if it will actually succeed.

I know, that's fine here.

If there are 5 modes, you need to set 5 to chip->read_retries, not 6.

If only 4 modes are used, there is probably a bug in the core that
must be fixed, please do not workaround it in the driver!
