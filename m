I was able to reproduce this failure on pre-7.1 versions of GCC.  It
seems that when:
1. code is using doubles
2. setting -mpreferred-stack-boundary=3 -mno-sse2, ie. 8B stack alignment
than GCC produces that error:
https://godbolt.org/z/7T8nbH

That's already a tall order of constraints, so it's understandable
that the compiler would just error likely during instruction
selection, but was eventually taught how to solve such constraints.

Thanks for the report.  Your testing these patches is invaluable, Shirish!

Seemingly only for older versions of GCC, pre 7.1.

I don't think it requires the incoming stack to be 16B aligned for
sse2, I think it requires the incoming and current stack alignment to
match. Today it does not, which is why we observe GPFs.

Hmmm...I would have liked to remove it outright, as it is an ABI
mismatch that is likely to result in instability and non-fun-to-debug
runtime issues in the future.  I suspect my patch does work for GCC
7.1+.  The question is: Do we want to either:
1. mark AMDGPU broken for GCC < 7.1, or
2. continue supporting it via stack alignment mismatch?

2 is brittle, and may break at any point in the future, but if it's
working for someone it does make me feel bad to outright disable it.
What I'd image 2 looks like is (psuedo code in a Makefile):

if CC_IS_GCC && GCC_VERSION < 7.1:
  set stack alignment to 16B and hope for the best

So my diff would be amended to keep the stack alignment flags, but
only to support GCC < 7.1.  And that assumes my change compiles with
GCC 7.1+. (Looks like it does for me locally with GCC 8.3, but I would
feel even more confident if someone with hardware to test on and GCC
7.1+ could boot test).
