To be fair, I think the only blame here is that MS let qcom get away
with some things in their ACPI and UEFI implementation..  I think
we'll need to shift to ACPI eventually for these laptops, in order to
keep up.  DT isn't a thing that would scale with the volume of x86
laptops that exist, and if aarch64 laptops get there too, we'll need
ACPI.  Lets face it, the # of different dt devices supported upstream
is a drop in the bucket compared to number of *actually physically
different* x86 devices supported by upstream.  (And I don't mean
individual models of laptops, but different production runs where they
picked a different panel or trackpad or whatever.)

But we have a lot of upstream work to get there to support how ACPI
works on these things:

 * The new Platform Extension Plugin (PEP) model for device power
   control
 * untangling drm bridge hookup from DT
 * untangling drm panel hook from DT
 * figuring out how to deal with mis-matches between dt device
   model and ACPI device model

There is some early work for ACPI support for these devices, but
realistically I think it is going to take a better part of a year to
get there.  Until then we rely on DT.

That isn't to say my proposal doesn't make a ton of sense.  We also
need to solve this problem for DT based devices, and I think
/chosen/panel-id makes a *ton* of sense for those devices.

not really a solution that is going to scale

again, a kernel (or bootloader) side massively intrusive re-write the
dt approach isn't going to scale.  If you keep it simple, ie.
/chosen/panel-id I can see a possibility to move my patch from
drivers/firmware/efi into an earlier stage.  But if it has to re-write
graph, that falls apart as soon as a new device comes along with a
different bridge, or perhaps some vendor decides to use dsi directly
and forego the bridge.

usually (from what I've seen so far) there are a few gpios to probe to
decide which panel you have.  So after a few lines of gpio banging you
can either ask fw engineers to set appropriate node in chosen.. or
re-write of_graph bindings.  I think the former has a chance of
gaining traction on android devices.. latter not so much.  You are
really making too big of an ask for fw engineers ;-)

I want a solution that is achievable ;-)
