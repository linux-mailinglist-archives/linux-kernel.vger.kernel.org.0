Yes. Printing from hardlockup watchdog is only special case.
Without it irq-work will flush per-cpu buffer right after enabling irq.

Yes. Softlockuo watchdog is a timer. It could use normal printk and
flush per-cpu buffers. Any periodically executed code could do that
but softlockup is most logical place for that.

There is forward signal from softlockup to hardlockup wathdogs in
per-cpu counter hrtimer_interrupts (increment means cpu in't in
hardlockup). This patch adds backward signal from hardlockup to
softlocup detector that some cpus are in hardlockup.

Hmm. This seems obvious from names of variables and called function.
Both watchdogs use same patterns: monotonic counter and side variable
with snapshot to detect changes or stalls.
