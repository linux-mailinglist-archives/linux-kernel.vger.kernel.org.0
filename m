For something like latency-<whatever>, I don't see the point of having
such a wide range. The nice range is probably more than enough - and before
even bothering about the range, we should probably agree on what the range
should represent.

If it's niceness, I read it as: positive latency-nice value means we're
nice to latency, means we reduce it. So the further up you go, the more you
restrict your wakeup scan. I think it's quite easy to map that into the
code: current behaviour at 0, with a decreasing scan mask size as we go
towards +19. I don't think anyone needs 512 steps to tune this.

I don't know what logic we'd follow for negative values though. Maybe
latency-nice -20 means always going through the slowpath, but what of the
intermediate values?

AFAICT this RFC only looks at wakeups, but I guess latency-nice can be
applied elsewhere (e.g. load-balance, something like task_hot() and its
use of sysctl_sched_migration_cost).
