I've reverted CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS to "is not set" for now as the
easiest option. We've got 35% coverage of binder.c again.

By "restore coverage" I meant that even if the IPC codepaths are
nearly the same tests knew to open /dev/binderN and these disappeared,
so no test could open any binder device and get any coverage in binder
code.

If anybody wants to try to test both, you are very welcome ;)
If you are hinting that I should do it, a single person can't test all
2000 subsystems in kernel, and testing each of them requires quite
some domain expertise. This really requires involvement of developers
of the code. I am sure there is lots to improve in the IPC codepaths
as well.
