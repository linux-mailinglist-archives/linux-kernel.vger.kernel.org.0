It's now my turn to get back on this topic.

I just put my noise back into this and for what I understand of the
clk subsystem, I think the situation you describe could be pictured
like this:

IMHO the fact that the first and third blocks are the same does not
interfere with device links.

Honestly, I cannot be 100% sure it won't break on qcom designs, maybe
the best would be to have someone to test. I don't have the relevant
hardware. Do you? It would be really helpful!

There is an entire PCIe series blocked, waiting for these device links
to be merged so it would help a lot if someone could test.

Thank you very much,
Miquèl
