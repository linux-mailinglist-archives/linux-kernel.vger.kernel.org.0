Sorry about that, will fix it.

Ouch! Sorry about that WARN_ON()! I could drop the warning and
make this :

	if (!system_supports_fpsimd() ||
	    (vcpu->arch.host_thread_info->flags & _TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE))
		vcpu->arch.flags &= ~(KVM_ARM64_FP_ENABLED |
				      KVM_ARM64_FP_HOST);

to make sure we never say fp is enabled.

What do you think ?

Cheers
Suzuki
