Do you know if any data is received during the delay? In theory that
shouldn't be the case since RTS is deasserted, just double-checking.

What happens if you add a longer delay (e.g. 1s) before/after setting
the host baudrate?

Yeah, that was another source of frame reassembly errors that we were
seeing on SDM845.

Balakrishna, please post these kind of replies on-list, so that
everybody can benefit from possible solutions or contribute to the
discussion.

Interesting.

FTR, this is the full UART pin configuration for cheza (SDM845):

&qup_uart6_default {
        /* Change pinmux to all 4 pins since CTS and RTS are connected */
        pinmux {
                pins = "gpio45", "gpio46",
                       "gpio47", "gpio48";
        };

        pinconf-cts {
                /*
                 * Configure a pull-down on 45 (CTS) to match the pull of
                 * the Bluetooth module.
                 */
                pins = "gpio45";
                bias-pull-down;
        };

        pinconf-rts-tx {
                /* We'll drive 46 (RTS) and 47 (TX), so no pull */
                pins = "gpio46", "gpio47";
                drive-strength = <2>;
                bias-disable;
        };

        pinconf-rx {
                /*
                 * Configure a pull-up on 48 (RX). This is needed to avoid
                 * garbage data when the TX pin of the Bluetooth module is
                 * in tri-state (module powered off or not driving the
                 * signal yet).
                 */
                pins = "gpio48";
                bias-pull-up;
        };
};

Does this correspond to what you tried on the Lenovo Miix 630?

Unfortunately I don't have a clear suggestion at this point, debugging
the original problem which lead to 2faa3f15fa2f ("Bluetooth: hci_qca:
wcn3990: Drop baudrate change vendor event") involved quite some time
and hooking up a scope/logic analyzer ...

I also suspect RTS is involved, and potentially the configuration of
the pulls. It might be interesting to analyze the data that leads to
the frame assembly error and determine if it is just noise (wrong
pulls/drive strength?) or received with a non-matching baud-rate.

The 50ms delay doesn't really cause any harm, but ideally we'd
understand what exactly is going on.
