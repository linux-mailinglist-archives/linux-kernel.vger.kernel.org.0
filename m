I was actually thinking to the ->write_page(_raw)() helpers, but
yeah, in the case of ->exec_op() it's different. However, for these
helpers as don't use ->exec_op(), we need another way to flag the
operation as destructive.

But actually we could let the driver toggle the pin for any operation.
If we want to be protected against spurious access, not directly ordered
by the controller driver itself, then we don't care if the operation is
actually destructive or not as long as the pin is deasserted during our
operations and asserted otherwise.
