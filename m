Is this complication something you can explain? I don't know what v4
and v5 are meant here.

I'm looking right now at getting Panfrost working on T720 with 64-bit
descriptors, with the ultimate goal of making Panfrost
64-bit-descriptor only so we can have a single build of Mesa in
distros.

Mmaps seem to work with this patch, thanks.

The main complication I'm facing right now seems to be that the SFBD
descriptor on T720 seems to be different from the one we already had
(tested on T6xx?).
