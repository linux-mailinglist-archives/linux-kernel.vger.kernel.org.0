Did you actually run it through Sphinx to see what you get?  If I
understand the effect you're after, you want something like this:

  The datasheet and reference manual are publicly available on
  STM32MP157_.

  .. _STM32MP157: https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32mp157.html

IOW you have to actually *use* the label you are setting up.  That's a fine
way to do it, I guess, though I'm not really convinced it's better than
just putting the URL in directly.

Thanks,
