Thanks for the clarification.

Do you have any logs showing this condition? I am interested because
from your description it seems like p1/p2 shouldn't be usually those
which trigger the oom, right? That suggests that it should be mostly p3,
... pn to be in the kernel triggering the oom and therefore they
shouldn't vanish.
