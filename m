Since all instructions (with the possible exception of RET) are
unconditional branch instructions: NOP, JMP, CALL. It makes no read
difference to the argument below.

( I'm thinking RET might be special in that it reads the return address
from the stack and therefore must emit the whole IP into the stream, as
we cannot know the stack state )

Given a start point (from a start or sync packet) we scan the
instruction stream forward until the first conditional branch
instruction. Then we consume the next available branch decision bit to
know where to continue.

So yes, we need to have a correct text image available for this to work.

The thing is, as I argued, the instruction state between PRE and POST is
ambiguous. This makes it impossible to decode the branch decision
stream.

Suppose CPU0 emits the PRE event at T1 and the POST event at T5, but we
have CPU1 covering the instruction at T3.

How do you decide where CPU1 goes and what the next conditional branch
is?
