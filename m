Yes. That's exactly my point. A hwrng that's suspended will fail here
and it's better to just not try until it's guaranteed to have resumed.

I haven't looked at them. Are they being called from suspend/resume
paths? I don't think anything for the userspace API can be a problem
because those tasks are all frozen. The only problem would be some
kernel internal API that TPM API exposes. I did a quick grep and I see
things like IMA or the trusted keys APIs that might need a closer look.

Either way, trying to hold off a TPM operation from the TPM API when
we're suspended isn't really possible. If something like IMA needs to
get TPM data from deep suspend path and it fails because the device is
suspended, all we can do is return an error from TPM APIs and hope the
caller can recover. The fix is probably going to be to change the code
to not call into the TPM API until the hardware has resumed by avoiding
doing anything with the TPM until resume is over. So we're at best able
to make same sort of band-aid here in the TPM API where all we can do is
say -EAGAIN but we can't tell the caller when to try again.
