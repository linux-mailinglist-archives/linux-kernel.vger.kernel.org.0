I did have a look at that possibility, but I didn't see how that could
work without potentially affecting userspace users of the syslog ABI.
AFAICS the suggested change in msg_print_text() can be done in one of
three ways:

 (1) msg_print_text() adds the '\0' and includes this length both when
     it estimates the size (NULL buffer) and when it actually prints:

     If we do this:
     - kmsg_dump_get_line_nolock() would have to subtract 1 from the len
       since its callers expected that len is always smaller than the
       size of the buffer.
     - The buffers given to use via the syslog interface will now include
       a '\0', potentially affecting userspace applications which use
       this ABI.
 
 (2) msg_print_text() adds the '\0', and includes this in the length
     only when estimating the size, and not when it actually prints.

     If we do this:
     - SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD tries uses the size estimate to give
       userspace a count of how many characters are present in the
       buffer, and now this count will start differing from the actual
       count that can be read, potentially affecting userspace
       applications.

 (3) msg_print_text() adds the '\0', and does not include this length
     in the result at all.

     If we do this:
     - The original kmsg dump issue is not solved, since the last line
       is still lost.

The fix is not attempting to fix a buffer overflow, theoretical or
otherwise.

It's a fix for a bug in functionality which has been observed on our
systems:  We use pstore to save the kernel log when the kernel crashes,
and sometimes the log in the pstore misses the last line, and since the
last line usual says why we're panicing so it's rather important not to
miss.

I'm not quite sure I follow.  The current code does fail to include the
*entire* last line.

The memcpy on line #1294 is never executed for the last line because we
stop the loop because of the check on line #1289:

  1270  static size_t msg_print_text(const struct printk_log *msg, bool syslog, char *buf, size_t size)
  1271  {
  1272          const char *text = log_text(msg);
  1273          size_t text_size = msg->text_len;
  1274          size_t len = 0;
  1275  
  1276          do {
  1277                  const char *next = memchr(text, '\n', text_size);
  1278                  size_t text_len;
  1279  
  1280                  if (next) {
  1281                          text_len = next - text;
  1282                          next++;
  1283                          text_size -= next - text;
  1284                  } else {
  1285                          text_len = text_size;
  1286                  }
  1287  
  1288                  if (buf) {
  1289                          if (print_prefix(msg, syslog, NULL) +
  1290                              text_len + 1 > size - len)
  1291                                  break;
  1292  
  1293                          len += print_prefix(msg, syslog, buf + len);
  1294                          memcpy(buf + len, text, text_len);
  1295                          len += text_len;
  1296                          buf[len++] = '\n';
  1297                  } else {
  1298                          /* SYSLOG_ACTION_* buffer size only calculation */
  1299                          len += print_prefix(msg, syslog, NULL);
  1300                          len += text_len;
  1301                          len++;
  1302                  }
