I don't think this is a good check to make.

In fact most cryptography folks say taking out more than 256bit is
never going to make sense, that's why BSD getentropy() even returns an
error if you ask for more than 256bit. (and glibc's getentropy()
wrapper around getrandom() enforces the same size limit btw)

On the BSDs the kernel's getentropy() call is primarily used to seed
their libc's arc4random() every now and then, and userspace is
supposed to use only arc4random(). I am pretty sure we should do the
same on Linux in the long run. i.e. the idea that everyone uses the
kernel syscall directly sounds wrong to me, and designing the syscall
so that everyone calls it is hence wrong too.

On the BSDs getentropy() is hence unconditionally blocking, without
any flags or so, which makes sense since it's not supposed to be
user-facing really so much, but more a basic primitive for low-level
userspace infrastructure only, that is supposed to be wrapped
non-trivially to be useful. (that's at least how I understood their
APIs)

aes128 is very common today. It's what baseline security is.

I have the suspicion crypto folks would argue that 128…256 is the only
sane range for cryptographic keys...
