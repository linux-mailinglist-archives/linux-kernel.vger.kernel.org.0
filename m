I don't think this is fundamentally different from the direct write
codepath. It's just that the source of the write is another OSD rather
than being sent in the request.

If you look at ceph_direct_read_write(), then it does this:

      /*
       * To simplify error handling, allow AIO when IO within i_size
       * or IO can be satisfied by single OSD request.
       */

So, that's another possibility. Do the requests synchronously when they
will result in a change to i_size. Otherwise, you can do them in
parallel.

In practice, we'd have to recommend that people truncate the destination
file up to the final length before doing copy_file_range, but that
doesn't sound too onerous.
