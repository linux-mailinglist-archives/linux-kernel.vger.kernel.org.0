I ran 500 iterations of cpuset_hotplug_test.sh on the branch, it passed.

I also cherry-picked commit 6426bfb1d5f0 ("cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug synchronous")
into v5.6-rc1 and ran 100 iterations and it passed too.

While investigating the problem, I could reproduce it all the way back to v5.0.
Stopped there so earlier versions could still have the problem.

Do you think it's worth porting the change to stable trees? Admittedly the
problem should be benign, but it did trigger an LTP failure.

I can check 4.19 and 4.14 stable trees (which at least in Android world are
still relevant) if you agree it makes sense to put a fix in stable.

Thanks
