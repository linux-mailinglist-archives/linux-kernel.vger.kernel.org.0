Why not? It can set up a 32-bit code segment descriptor, far-branch
into it, and then execute SYSCALL. I can't see anything preventing
this in the logic involved in descriptor adjustment system calls. In
fact it looks to be at least partly the opposite - fill_ldt()
disallows creation of 64-bit code segments (oddly enough
fill_user_desc() then still copies the bit back, despite there
apparently being no way for it to get set).

Fine with me, changed.
