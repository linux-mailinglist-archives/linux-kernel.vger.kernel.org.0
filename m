I agree. Both the patchset tries to classify a tasks for some purpose for better latency.
TurboSched requires the classification of whether the task is jitter and should not be given
enough resources/frequency. This is a boolean value.
Whereas, latency-nice is a range. So does that mean that a max-latency-nice task is a jitter?

I was thinking of not doing jitter packing on a core occupying
min-latency-nice (i.e, latency sensitive) task (until there are other busier cores).

Given this, we can expose a single per-task attribute to the user by a syscall, right?

Definitely.
