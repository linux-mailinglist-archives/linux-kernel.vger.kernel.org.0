Looks like that happens because the clocks are only registered at
the component bind phase, rather than the probe phase. And to bind
all the components, the DSI controller wants the DPHY available,
which isn't because it's still waiting for the clock.

So you could try moving the bits that register the clocks in the
TCON TOP driver to the probe function, and see if that solves
the circular dependency issue.
