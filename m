Once offline, the memmap is garbage. When onlining again:

a) memmap will be re-initialized
b) online_page_callback_t will be called for every page in the section. 
The driver can mark them offline again and not give them to the buddy.
c) section will be marked online.

The driver that marked these pages to be skipped when offlining is 
responsible for registering the online_page_callback_t callback where 
these pages will get excluded.

This is exactly the same as when onling a memory block that is partially 
populated (e.g., HpyerV balloon right now).

So it's effectively "re-initializing the memmap using the driver 
knowledge" when onlining.

> Should we allow to try_remove_memory to succeed with these pages?

I think we should first properly offline them (mark sections offline and 
memory blocks, fixup numbers, shrink zones ...). The we can cleanly 
remove the memory. (see [PATCH RFC v3 8/9] mm/memory_hotplug: Introduce 
offline_and_remove_memory())

Once offline, the memmap is irrelevant and try_remove_memory() can do 
its job.

Returning them to the buddy is problematic for various reasons. Let's 
have a look at __offline_pages():

1) start_isolate_page_range()
-> offline pages with a reference count of one will be detected as 
unmovable -> BAD, we abort right away. We could hack around that.

2) memory_notify(MEM_GOING_OFFLINE, &arg);
-> Here, we could release all pages to the buddy, clearing PG_offline
-> BAD, PF_offline must not be cleared so dumping tools will not touch
    these pages. I don't see a way to hack around that.

3) scan_movable_pages() ...

4a) memory_notify(MEM_OFFLINE, &arg);

Perfect, it worked. Sections are offline.

4b) undo_isolate_page_range(start_pfn, end_pfn, MIGRATE_MOVABLE);
     memory_notify(MEM_CANCEL_OFFLINE, &arg);

-> Offlining failed for whatever reason.
-> Pages are in the buddy, but we already un-isolated them. BAD.

By not going via the buddy we avoid these issues and can leave 
PG_offline set until the section is fully offline. Something that is 
very desirable for virtio-mem (and as far as I can tell also HyperV in 
the future).

Makes sense. It really boils down to "offline" vs. "allocate" use cases.

So maybe instead of "SKIP_FOO" something like "MEMORY_OFFLINE". ?
