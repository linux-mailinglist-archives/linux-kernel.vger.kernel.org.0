GDB does rely on at least some behavior.  If I tell gdb to call a
function on my behalf, doesn't it save the old state, call the
function, and then restore the state?  Surely it expects the restore
operation to actually restore the state.

No clue.  But at least if this type of use is mostly interactive, then
users should be that badly affected.

It also helps that very, very few 64-bit applications use nonzero
segments at all.  They used to because of a kernel optimization to
automatically load a segment if an FS or GSBASE less than 4GB was
requested, but that's been gone for a while.  Calling
set_thread_area() at all in a 64-bit program requires considerable
gymnastics, and distributions can and do disable modify_ldt() outright
without significant ill effects.

So we're mostly talking about compatibility with 32-bit programs and
exotic users like Wine and DOSEMU.

I think there's a general impedance mismatch between gdb and the
kernel/hw here.  On Linux on a 64-bit machine, there's isn't really a
strong concept of a "32-bit process" versus a "64-bit process".  All
tasks have 64-bit values in RAX, all tasks have R8-R15, all tasks have
a GDT and an LDT, etc.  "32-bit tasks" are merely tasks that happen to
be running with a compatibility selector loaded into CS at the time.
Tasks can and do switch freely between compatibility and long mode
using LJMP or LRET.  As far as I can tell, however, gdb doesn't really
understand this and thinks that 32-bit tasks are their own special
thing.

This causes me real problems: gdb explodes horribly if I connect gdb
to QEMU's gdbserver (qemu -s) and try to debug during boot when the
inferior switches between 32-bit and long mode.

As far as FSGSBASE goes, a "32-bit task" absolutely can set
independent values in FS and FSBASE, although it's awkward to do so:
the task would have to do a far transfer to long mode, then WRFSBASE,
then far transfer back to compat mode.  But this entire sequence of
events could occur without entering the kernel at all, and the ptrace
API should be able to represent the result.  I think that, ideally, a
64-bit debugger would understand the essential 64-bitness of even
compat tasks and work sensibly.  I don't really expect gdb to be able
to do this any time soon, though.

Indeed.  But I never understood how this behavior could be implemented
with the current ABI.  As I understand it, gdb only ever sets the
inferior register state by using a single ptrace() call to load the
entire state, which means that the kernel does not know whether just
FS is being written or whether FS and FSBASE are being written.

What actual ptrace() call does gdb use when a 64-bit gdb debugs a
64-bit inferior?  How about a 32-bit inferior?

What would the actual API be?

I think it could make sense to add a whole new ptrace() command to
tell the tracee to, in effect, MOV a specified value to a segment
register.  This call would have the actual correct semantics in which
it would return an error code if the specified value is invalid and
would return 0 on success.  And then a second ptrace() call could be
issued to read out FSBASE or GSBASE if needed.  Would this be useful?
What gdb commands would invoke it?

Right.  But how does the kernel tell the difference?

In my test cases, I use mmap() with MAP_32BIT to avoid this issue.
