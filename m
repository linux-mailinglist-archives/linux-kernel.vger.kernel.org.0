The throughput drop is probably caused caused by kmemleak slowing down
all memory allocations (including skb). So that's expected. You may get
similar drop with other debug options like lock proving, kasan.

That's the kmemleak disabling path. I don't have the full log but I
suspect by setting a small pool size, kmemleak failed to allocate memory
and went into disabling itself. The clean-up above tries to remove the
allocated metadata. It seems that it takes significant time on your
platform. Not sure how to avoid the soft lock-up but I wouldn't bother
too much about it, it's only triggered by a previous error condition
disabling kmemleak.

A small memory pool for kmemleak just disables it shortly after boot, so
it's no longer in the way and you get your throughput back.

Yes for the throughput. Not sure about the soft lock-up. Do you have the
full log around the lock-up?
