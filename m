One of them may have introduced a crash.  If there is a bad reference
count manipulation elsewhere, then fixing one could cause a later
incorrect one to make a double free.

On the other hand, I don't know if the one that seemed to cause a crash
really caused a crash.  It was detected by syzkaller, and it is also
possible that git bisect ended up at the wrong place.

In any case, forgetting an of_node_put will normally just waste a little
memory, so probably stable kernels don't care.
