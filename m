No, my output is probably not within standard perf report. They are
totally 6 columns but only one column ('Sampled Cycles%') needs to be 
sorted. Other columns are not sorted. They only output some information.

For sort_entry, maybe the sorted column ('Sampled Cycles%') can use 
sort_entry, but others may not need it. So I don't know if I really need 
the sort_entry for my case.

I just feel maybe I still misunderstand what you have suggested. :(
