Thanks Andrew! Things definitely moved along after the patchseries got
into -next :D

By my count I think all my patches outside of the tests patch have
been acked or reviewed. When you have a chance I have a couple of
questions:

1. For the non-tests patch, anything pending on those preventing
eventual submission to linus's tree?
2. For the tests patch, I only have a Tested-by from Sandipan. Is that
good enough? If the worst comes to worst and I don't get a review on
that patch I would rather (if possible) that 'tests' patch can be
dropped while I nag folks for a review, rather than block submission
of the entire patch series. I ask because it's been out for review for
some time and it's the one I got least discussion on so I'm not sure
I'll have a review by the time it's needed.

Thanks again!
