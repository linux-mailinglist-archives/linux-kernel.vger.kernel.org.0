Quite contrary.

When is_register == true we know that a) the caller is install_breakpoint()
and b) the original insn is NOT int3 unless this page was alreadt COW'ed by
userspace, say, by gdb.

If is_register == false we only know that the caller is remove_breakpoint().
We can't know if this page was COW'ed by uprobes or userspace, we can not
know if the insn we are going to replace is int3 or not, thus we can not
assume that verify_opcode() will fail and save us.
