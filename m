Presumably the ucsi driver is drivers/usb/typec/ucsi/ucsi_acpi.c? Is
that right? And on ACPI based systems is this I/O memory or just some
carved out memory region that is used to communicate something to the
ACPI firmware? From looking at the ucsi driver it seems like it should
be mapped with memremap() instead of ioremap() given that it's not
actual I/O memory that has any sort of memory barrier or access width
constraints. It looks more like some sort of memory region that is being
copied into and out of while triggering some DSM. Can it at least be
memremap()ed with MEMREMAP_WT?

It also looks like this sort of problem has come up before, see commit
1f9f9d168ce6 ("usb: typec: ucsi: acpi: Workaround for cache mode
issue"). Ugh.

I've been wanting to change memremap() to be a "just give me memory"
type of API but haven't finished that task. It got hung up on mapping
memory specially for UEFI framebuffers to match whatever the UEFI mmap
table tells us.
