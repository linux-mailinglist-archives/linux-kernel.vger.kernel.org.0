I am not sure if that is acceptable, i mean what to do when GFP_ATOMIC
gets failed in atomic context? Or we can just consider it as out of
memory and another variant is to say that headless object can be called
from preemptible context only.

What do you mean here, Joel? "grow an rcu_head on the stack"?

If the current context is preemptable then we can inline synchronize_rcu()
together with freeing to handle such corner case, i mean when we are run
out of memory.

As for "task_struct's rcu_read_lock_nesting". Will it be enough just
have a look at preempt_count of current process? If we have for example
nested rcu_read_locks:

<snip>
rcu_read_lock()
    rcu_read_lock()
        rcu_read_lock()
<snip>

the counter would be 3.
