Hm right ... I only looked at this starting with console_unlock.

One thing to keep in mind is that the kernel is already dying, and
things will come crashing down later on (I've seen this only in dmesg
tails capture in pstore in our CI, i.e. the box died for good). I just
want to make sure that the useful information isn't overwritten by
more dmesg splats that happen as a consequence of us somehow trying to
run things on an offline cpu. Once console_unlock has completed in
your above backtrace and the important stuff has gone out I'm totally
fine with the kernel just dying. Pulling the wake_up_process out from
under the semaphore.lock is enough to prevent lockdep from dumping
more stuff while we're trying to print the important things, and I
think the untangling of the locking hiararchy is useful irrespective
of this lockdep splat. Plus Peter doesn't sound like he likes to roll
out more printk_deferred kind of things.

But if you think I should do the printk_deferred thing too I can look
into that. Just not quite sure what that's supposed to look like now.
