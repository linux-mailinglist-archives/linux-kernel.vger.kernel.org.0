We started from separated REQ_OP_ASSIGN_RANGE in v1, but then we decided
to use a modifier because this looks better and scatters less over
I/O stack. See "[PATCH RFC 0/3] block,ext4: Introduce REQ_OP_ASSIGN_RANGE
to reflect extents allocation in block device internals" series for the details.
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/1/7/1616 and neighbouring messages).

Last version of the patchset is v5 and it's here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/1/22/643
