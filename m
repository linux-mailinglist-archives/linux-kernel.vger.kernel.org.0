There are advantages and disadvantages either way.  The advantage of the
per-CPU pool is that you don't have to worry about something like lock
contention causing even more pain during an OOM event.  One potential
problem wtih the per-CPU pool can happen when callbacks are offloaded,
in which case the CPUs needing the memory might never be getting it,
because in the offloaded case (RCU_NOCB_CPU=y) the CPU posting callbacks
might never be invoking them.

But from what I know now, systems built with CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=y
either don't have heavy callback loads (HPC systems) or are carefully
configured (real-time systems).  Plus large systems would probably end
up needing something pretty close to a slab allocator to keep from dying
from lock contention, and it is hard to justify that level of complexity
at this point.

Or is there some way to mark a specific slab allocator instance as being
able to keep some amount of memory no matter what the OOM conditions are?
If not, the current per-CPU pre-allocated cache is a better choice in the
near term.
