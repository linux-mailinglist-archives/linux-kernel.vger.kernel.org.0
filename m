No, it doesn't. It relies heavily on how nested clusters are interpreted
too, so it is quite fragile.

We have had this discussion a couple of times over the last couple of
years. The story, IIRC, is that when we introduced capacity awareness in
the wake-up path (wake_cap()) we realised (I think it was actually you)
that we could use select_idle_sibling() in cases where we know that the
search space is limited to cpus with sufficient capacity so we didn't
have to take the long route through find_idlest_cpu(). Back then, big
and little were grouped by clusters so it was "safe" to use
select_idle_sibling() on cpu or prev_cpu if they have sufficient
capacity.

With DynamiQ the true topology on many systems is just one cluster and
hence using select_idle_sibling() there means search space includes all
cpu types which isn't "safe" if you have a task requiring more capacity
than can be offered by any cpu in the system. We need to use the
find_idlest_cpu() path on more cases than we do today.

All the code is there I think, we just have to tweak some conditions. I
can try to come up with a simple fix we can discuss and refine as
necessary.
