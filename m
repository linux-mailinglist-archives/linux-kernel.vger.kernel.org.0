Subject: [PATCH RFC] mtd: ubi: Add fastmap sysfs attribute

From: Zhihao Cheng <chengzhihao1@huawei.com>

The UBI device can be attached to a MTD device via fastmap by set
CONFIG_MTD_UBI_FASTMAP to 'y' (If there already exists a fastmap on the
UBI device). To support some debugging scenarios, attaching process by
fastmap can be confirmed in dmesg. If the UBI device is attached by
fastmap, logs like following will appear in dmesg:

  ubi0: attached by fastmap

If multiple UBI devices are attached to multiple MTD devices at the same
time, how to distinguish which UBI devices are successfully attached by
fastmap? Extracting attaching information for each UBI device one by one
from dmesg is a way. A better method is to record fastmap existence in
sysfs, so it can be obtained by userspace tools.

This patch exposes fastmap on sysfs. Suppose you attach an UBI device to a
MTD device by fastmap: if fastmap equals to '1', that is, the fastmap
generated before last detaching operation is confirmed valid. Else, there
may be some problems with old fastmap. Besides, userspace tool can also
check whether the fastmap updating triggered by other operations (such as
resize volume) is successful by reading this sysfs attribute.
