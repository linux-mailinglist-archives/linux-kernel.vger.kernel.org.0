I was developing driver for yet-another ROHM PMIC when I hit the
phenomena you have been discussing here (I think) :) I used regulator-boot-on
flag from DT in my test setup and then did a test consumer who does

regulator_get()
regulator_enable()
regulator_disable() pair.

As this 'test consumer' was only user for the regulator I expected the
regulator to be disabled after call to regulator_disable. But it was
not.

It seems to me that the use_count is incremented for boot-on regulators
before first call to regulator_enable(). So when the consumer does first
regulator_enable() the use_count will actually go to 2. Hence the
corresponding regulator_disable() won't actually disable the regulator
even though the consumer is actually only known user.

I did unbalanced regulator_disable() - which does disable the regulator
but it also spills the warning.

I did instrument the regmap helpers and regulator_enable/disable to
dump out the actual i2c accesses and use_counts. Regulator enable prints
use_count _before_ incrementing it.


Check enable state after regulator_get (calls regulator_is_enabled)

Hmm.. What is the intended way to explicitly tell the OS to drop the
reference? I would assume we should still use same logic as with other
regulators - if last user calls regulator_disable() we should disable
the regulator? (I may not understand all this well enough though)

Here I am again just a man in the middle as I am "only a component vendor"
and lack of complete system information. But I _think_ some of the users
of BD71827 and BD71847 PMICs do use setup where regulator-boot-on is
used to enable certain BUCKs to power some graphics chip at start-up. At
later stage it should be possible to cut the power in order to do power
saving or decrease heating when graphichs are not needed. So I think it
would be nice to fix this somehow.

How should we handle cases where we want OS to enable regulator at
boot-up - possibly before consumer drivers can be load?
