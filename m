So after reading most of the first patch (and it look _much_ better than
previous times), I'm left wondering *why* ?!

That is, why do we need this complexity, as compared to that
CPU serialized approach?

What do we hope to gain by doing a multi-writer buffer? Yes, it is
awesome, but from where I'm sitting it is also completely silly, because
we'll want to CPU serialize the serial console anyway (otherwise it gets
to be a completely unreadable mess).

By having the whole thing CPU serialized we looose multi-writer and
consequently the buffer gets to be significantly simpler (as you know;
because ISTR you've actually done this before -- but I cannot find here
why that didn't live).

In my book simpler is better here. printk() is an absolute utter slow
path anyway, nobody cares about the performance much, and I'm thinking
that it should be plenty fast enough as long as you don't run a
synchronous serial output (which is exactly what I do do/require
anyway).

So can we have a few words to explain why we need multi-writer and all
this complexity?
