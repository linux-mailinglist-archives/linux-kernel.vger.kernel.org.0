And if the IOVA space is consumed to the point that we've fallen back to 
that desperate last resort, what do you think the chances are that a 
significant number of percpu magazines will be *empty*? Also bear in 
mind that in that case we've already walked the rbtree once, so any 
notion of still being fast is long, long gone.

As for CPU hotplug, it's a comparatively rare event involving all manner 
of system-wide synchronisation, and the "optimisation" of shaving a few 
dozen CPU cycles off at one point *if* things happen to line up 
correctly is taking a cup of water out of a lake. If the domain is busy 
at the time, then once again chances are the magazines aren't empty and 
having an extra check redundant with the loop condition simply adds 
(trivial, but nonzero) overhead to every call. And if the domain isn't 
busy, then the lock is unlikely to be contended anyway.

Sorry, but without convincing evidence, this change just looks like 
churn for the sake of it.

Robin.
