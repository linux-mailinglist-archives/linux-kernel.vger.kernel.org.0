Agreed, it is not really compatible with the current fast-path policies.
I would start with just hacking it in to evaluate the potential
improvements to have an idea about what is on the table.

As you say, it could live somewhere slightly out the way like the EAS
path, but I'm not sure if actually fits well under EAS. EAS is disabled
for symmetric CPU capacities, which is probably the systems that will
benefit the most. Also, as mentioned already in this thread, I don't see
how the idea brings any energy savings?
