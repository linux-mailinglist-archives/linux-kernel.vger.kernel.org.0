Kbuild support two file names, "Makefile" and "Kbuild"
for describing obj-y, obj-m, etc.

If both exist in the same directory, "Kbuild" takes precedence.

This is useful where we want to use "Makefile"
for other purposes.

For external modules, we use "Makefile" as a start point,
so we often want to  describe obj-m in "Kbuild" instead of "Makefile".


Similarly, arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile is very special
in that it is included from the top-level Makefile,
and specify arch-specific compiler flags etc.

We can use arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kbuild
to specify obj-y, obj-m.
The top-level Makefile does not need to know
the directory structure under arch/$(SRCARCH)/.

This is logical separation.

There are lots of arch-specific build settings.
We definitely need a place to describe them,
hence arch/$(SRCARCH)/Makefile.

For example, arch/x86/Kbuild is quite useful
since there are many directories in arch/x86.

riscv does not have many directories for now since it is a new architecture,
but it will be useful when it will have more directories.

No, I do not think so.
