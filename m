Great :) In the meantime, I've done some experiments creating an I2C 
driver based on tpm_tis_core, see 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11049363/ Please have a look at that 
and provide your feedback (and/or use it as a basis for further 
implementations).

It turned out not to be that different in the end, see the code 
mentioned above and my comment here: 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/11049365/

> 2. Handling I2C CRC - relevant only to I2C bus hence not supported today by TIS core

That is completely optional, so there is no need to implement it in the 
beginning. Also, do you expect a huge benefit from that functionality? 
Are bit flips that much more likely on I2C compared to SPI, which has no 
CRC at all, but still works fine?

> 3. Handling Chip specific issues, since I2C implementation might be slightly different across the various TPM vendors

Right, that seems similar to the cr50 issues 
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/7/17/677), so there should probably be a 
similar way to do it.

> 4. Modify tpm_tis_send_data and tpm_tis_recv_data to work according the TCG Device Driver Guide (optimization on TPM_STS access and send/recv retry)

Optimizations are always welcome, but I'd expect basic communication to 
work already with the current code (though maybe not as efficiently as 
possible).
