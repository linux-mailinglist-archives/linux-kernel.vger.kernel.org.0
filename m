Hm yes, we already have iommu_fault_page_request::private_data for that.
I think I used to stash flags in iommu_private (is_stall and
needs_pasid), so that the SMMUv3 driver doesn't need to go fetch them
from the device structure, but I removed them. If VT-d doesn't need
iommu_private either, maybe we can remove it entirely?

In any case I agree that device drivers should only need to know about
evt->fault.

By the way, does private_data need to go back through the
iommu_page_response() path? The current series doesn't do that.

That's already the case: we decided in thread [1] to track recoverable
faults in the IOMMU core, in order to check that the response is sane
and to set a quota and/or timeout. (I didn't include your timeout
patches here because I think they need a little more work. They are on
my sva/api branch.)

I already dropped iommu_private from the iommu_page_response structure.
In patch 4 iommu_page_response() retrieves the fault event and pass the
corresponding iommu_private back to the IOMMU driver.
