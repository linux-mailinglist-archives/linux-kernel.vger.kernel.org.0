This solves it all at one site. If we're going to sprinkle CR2
save/restore over 'all' sites we're bound to miss some and we'll be
playing catch-up forever :/

That misses the context tracking tracepoint, which is also before we
load CR2.

And this misses the perf unwinder, which we can reach if we attach perf
to the tracepoint. We can most likely also do user accesses from
kprobes, which we can similarly attach to tracepoints, and there's eBPF,
and who knows what else...

Do we really want to go put CR2 save/restore around every single thing
that can cause a fault (any fault) and is reachable from a tracepoint?
That's going to be a long list of things ... :/

Or are we going to put the CR2 save/restore on every single tracepoint?
But then we also need it on the mcount/fentry stubs and we again have
multiple places.

Whereas if we stick it in the entry path, like I proposed, we fix it in
one location and we're done.
