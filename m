There are several things at play here.
1. syzkaller has notion of "resources". A resource is something that's
produced by one system call and consumed by another, like a file
descriptor.
E.g. see this for userfault fd:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/698773cb4fbe8873ee0a2c37b86caef01e2c6159/sys/linux/uffd.txt#L8-L12
This allows syzkaller to understand that there is something called
fd_uffd that is produced by userfaultfd() and then needs to be passed
to ioctl$UFFDIO_API().
So for close it knows that it needs to get the fd somewhere first.

2. For syscalls are not explicitly tied by any resources, it will just
try to combine them randomly.

3. There is coverage-guided reinforcement learning. When it discovers
some sensible combinations of syscalls (as denoted by new kernel code
coverage) it memorizes that program for future mutations to get even
more interesting and more sensible programs. This is allows syzkaller
to build more and more interesting programs by doing small incremental
steps (this is the general idea of coverage-guided fuzzing).
