How is B (low $EPS) C (low 3-$EPS) where $EPS->0 so much different
from the above. You prioritize C over B, D over B in both cases under
global memory pressure.

I am pretty sure you have a lot of experiences from the FB workloads.
And I haven't ever questioned that. All I am trying to explore here is
what the consequences of the new proposed semantic are. I have provided
few examples of when an opt-out from memory protection might be
practical. You seem to disagree on relevance of those usecases and I can
live with that. Not that I am fully convinced because there is a
different between a very tight resource control which is your primary
usecase and a much simpler deployments focusing on particular resources
which tend to work most of the time and occasional failures are
acceptable.

That being said, the new interface requires an explicit opt-in via mount
option so there is no risk of regressions. So I can live with it. Please
make sure to document explicitly that the effective low limit protection
doesn't allow to opt-out even when the limit is set to 0 and the
propagated protection is fully assigned to a sibling memcg.

It would be also really appreciated if we have some more specific examples
of priority inversion problems you have encountered previously and place
them somewhere into our documentation. There is essentially nothing like
that in the tree.

Thanks!
