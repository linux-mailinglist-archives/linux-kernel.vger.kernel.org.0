Hmm.. I agree that current hard code method is not flexible enough, and I
proposed below patch last year to adjust interval according to space usage, it
looks Jaegeuk partially agreed with that, and pointed out we need to distinguish
low/high-end storage to decide interval. And also you point out that btrfs
introduces mount option "ssd" to let user give the device type, and we can
distinguish with that. :P

But I pended below patch based on Jaegeuk's and your idea due to other work...
