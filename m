Here you are looking at the old code. After that there are several of =0A=
changes related to suspend/resume functions.=0A=
=0A=
This is the link to the code with changes. Latest version of those =0A=
functions.=0A=
=0A=
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/dri=
vers/usb/dwc2/hcd.c#n4489=0A=
=0A=
Your changes are sitting on that latest version of code. Not the old =0A=
version of it.=0A=

I think you did this tests on the old version of the code=0A=
=0A=
I have tested the flow myself with the mainline Kernel on =0A=
"torvalds/master" and not HPRT0_SUSP nor PCGCTL_STOPPCLK are not being set.=
=0A=
=0A=
So here you need to review those things again.=0A=
