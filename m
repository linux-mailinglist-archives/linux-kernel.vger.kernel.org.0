If there is interest, please provide feedback, ideally also in the 
circle where I started spec discussions and QEMU implementation.

Nope, in fact there are only primitive demo backends for block and 
console available that make use of UIO, see

http://git.kiszka.org/?p=linux.git;a=blob;f=tools/virtio/virtio-ivshmem-block.c;h=c97aa5076a6d22ccd01862f3e4db0e12641825c3;hb=refs/heads/queues/ivshmem2

and

I was hoping to find something useful in ACRN but didn't succeed. So I 
hacked up these two (basically in two evenings, that's why these two are 
copy&paste). For the future, when the transport is more stable, looking 
into a vhost mapping could be beneficial, specifically for networking. 
Another direction could be https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-virtio.

Great, looking forward!

Yes, there is definitely interest, for various reasons. One can be cache 
coloring. We are also considering to look into this boot mode in the 
context of the just started RISC-V port. And there might be a case on 
x86 again, but the boot environment is still not clear to me there 
(likely not UEFI).

If you have a prototype for ARM64 and U-Boot, that would be great to see 
it, maybe let more people play with it. Eventually, I want to start 
discussing requirements and potentially required new interfaces.
