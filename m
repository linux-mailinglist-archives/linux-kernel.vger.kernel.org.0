I'm seeing similar things running post v5.1 on ARAnyM (Atari emulator):

    EXT4-fs (sda1): mounting ext3 file system using the ext4 subsystem
    ...
    EXT4-fs error (device sda1): ext4_get_branch:171: inode #1980:
block 27550: comm jbd2/sda1-1980: invalid block

and userspace hung somewhere during initial system startup, so I had to
kill the instance.

Notes:
  - It's always the same block,
  - Block device is an image file, accessed using
    arch/m68k/emu/nfblock.c, which did not receive any recent (bvec)
    updates.
  - There are no reported errors for the device containing the image
    file on the host,
  - Given Arthur sees the issue on a different class of machines, it's
    unlikely the issue is related to a problem with the block device
    (driver). It may still be an issue with the block layer, though,
  - Both Arthur and I are mounting an ext3 file system using the ext4
    subsystem.

Thanks!
