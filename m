What I typically do is this:
  1. If the changes due to review are minor, I just add my SoB below the
     original SoB,
  2. If the changes are not insignificant, I also add a line "[geert: Did foo]"
     in between the original SoB and mine,
  3. If the patch needed a complete rewrite, I assume ownership, and add
     "Based on/inspired by ..." to the patch description to give credit.

Hope this helps (and is acceptable for other people ;-)
