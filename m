Subject: [PATCH 00/35] irqchip/gic-v4: GICv4.1 architecture support

[Apologies for posting this during the merge window, I'm fighting against
 another deadline which is incompatible with the -rc1 time frame]

This rather long series expands the existing GICv4 support to deal with the
new GICv4.1 architecture, which comes with a set of major improvements
compared to v4.0:

- One architectural doorbell per vcpu, instead of one doorbell per VLPI

- Doorbell entirely managed by the HW, with an "at most once" delivery
  guarantee per non-residency phase and only when requested by the
  hypervisor

- A shared memory scheme between ITSs and redistributors, allowing for an
  optimised residency sequence (the use of VMOVP becomes less frequent)

- Support for direct virtual SGI delivery (the injection path still involves
  the hypervisor), at the cost of losing the active state on SGIs. It
  shouldn't be a big deal, but some guest operating systems might notice
  (Linux definitely won't care)

On the other hand, public documentation is not available yet, so that's a
bit annoying..

The series is roughly organised in 5 parts:

(1) A bunch of reworks to make the checking of some features more
    straightforward,
(2) VPE table allocation, new flavours of VMAPP/VMOVP commands
(3) v4.1 doorbell management
(4) Virtual SGI support
(5) Plumbing of virtual SGIs in KVM

Note that patch #1 has been previously posted, and forms the base of this
work. This has had *very little* testing on a fairly early model, and some
behaviours are unexpected (the VSGI feature clearly misbehaves). But it is
in a shape that should make it possible to review and even debug. Consider
this an opportunity to influence the shape of this code at an early stage!
