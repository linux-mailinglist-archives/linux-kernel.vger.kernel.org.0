My first step is indeed to add "== DYNTICK_IRQ_NONIDLE".

Well, comparing to 0x2 is probably cheaper than comparing to
0x4000000000000000 on most architectures.  Probably not a really big
deal, but this is after all the interrupt-entry fastpath.  Or is the
compiler trickier than I am giving it credit for?  (Still, seems like
comparing to 0x2 is one small instruction and to 0x4000000000000000 is
one big instruction at the very least, and probably several instructions
on many architectures.)

But to your point, if it is absolutely necessary to turn on the tick
at interrupt entry, then the larger comparison cannot be avoided.

Yes, but let's see what is possible.  ;-)
