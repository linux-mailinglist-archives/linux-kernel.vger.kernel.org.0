I dunno. I would have to think about this much more. The whole
expectation that node 0 is always around is simply broken. But also
list_lru_memcg_aware looks very suspicious. We should have a flag or
something rather than what we have now.

I am still not sure I have completely understood the problem though.
I will try to get to this during the week but Vladimir should be much
better fit to judge here.
