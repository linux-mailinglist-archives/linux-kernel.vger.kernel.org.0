For the sqthread setup, there's no notion of "do this many". It just
grabs whatever it can and issues it. This means that the mm assign
is really per-sqe. What we did before, with the batching, just optimized
it so we'd only grab it for one batch IFF at least one sqe in that batch
needed the mm.

Since you've killed the batching, I think the logic should be something
ala:

if (io_sqe_needs_user(sqe) && !cur_mm)) {
	if (already_attempted_mmget_and_failed_ {
		-EFAULT end sqe
	} else {
		do mm_get and mmuse dance
	}
}

Hence if the sqe doesn't need the mm, doesn't matter if we previously
failed. If we need the mm and previously failed, -EFAULT.
