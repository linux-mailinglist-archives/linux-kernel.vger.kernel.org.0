We have stopped adding "invisible" fields to the list. So, you
can drop the changes to cpu-feature-registers.txt.

nit: I would rather omit the implementation details (esp variable names)
in the documentation. It may become a pain to keep this in sync with the
code changes. You could simply mention, "we keep track of the 
availability of the feature" per CPU. If someone wants to figure out
how, they can always read the code.

For the sake of one kernel runs everywhere, do we need some other
mechanism to disable the AMU. e.g kernel parameter to disable amu
at runtime ?
