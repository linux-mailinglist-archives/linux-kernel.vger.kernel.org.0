I am trying to reproduce the lock locally, and installed an opensuse
Tumbleweed in a VM. When forwarding a Unifying receiver to the VM, I
do not see the lock with either my vanilla compiled kernel and the rpm
found in http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Kernel:/HEAD/standard/x86_64/

Next step is install Tumbleweed on bare metal, but I do not see how
this could introduce a difference (maybe USB2 vs 3).

Yes. I have an other revert never submitted that I need to push, so I
guess I can do a revert session today.

I think I'll also buy one device with hopefully the C52F receiver as
the report descriptors attached in
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203619 seems different to
what I would have expected.
