Yeah, I was thinking that we just go with these patches and then fix
the IPI issue when someone starts complaining ;-)

Anyway, is this series ready to go? I can pull them in (I guess I
should get an ack from Thomas or Ingo as they are x86 specific). I'm
currently working on code that affects the same code paths as this
patch, and would like to build my changes on top of this, instead of
monkeying around with major conflicts.
