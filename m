Mathieu, Thanks a lot for the explanation, it makes complete sense. It
sounds from Chris's reply that tcmalloc already checks
__rseq_abi.cpu_id and is not dlopened/closed. Considering these, it
seems to already handle things properly - CMIIW.

Chris, Brian, is there any other concern to upgrading of tcmalloc
version in ChromeOS? I believe there was some concern about detection
of rseq kernel support. A quick look at tcmalloc shows it does not do
such detection, but I can stand corrected. One more thing, currently
tcmalloc does not use rseq on ARM. If I recall, ARM does have rseq
support as well. So we ought to enable it for that arch as well if
possible. Why not enable it on all arches and then dynamically detect
at runtime if needed support is available?

Thanks,
Joel
