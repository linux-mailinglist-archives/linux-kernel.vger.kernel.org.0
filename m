Yes, please do so.  Please work off of either the staging-next or even
better, staging-testing as that contains the latest patches.  I apply
patches to the -testing branch first, and if that passes the 0-day bot,
I then merge them to -next.

Given that there are a lot of people working on this codebase right now
(as it needs so much obvious work), I would recommend using -next and
getting used to rebasing your changes :)

I take patches as they are submitted, so sometimes people do step on
each other's toes, that's normal.  But I think you are the only one
touching the i2c driver at the moment so it shouldn't be that bad.

This is beyond the "first patch" work, this is now in the "being an
active developer" workflow :)

thanks,
