(I apologize for dropping the ball on this, I'm intended to do RFCv2 in
a nearby future)

Regarding this particular hint (let's call it 'no nonarchitectural
coresharing' for now) I don't see much value in communicating change to
guest when it happens. Imagine our host for some reason is not able to
guarantee that anymore e.g. we've migrated to a host with less pCPUs
and/or special restrictions and have to start sharing. What we, as a
guest, are supposed to do when we receive a notification? "You're now
insecure, deal with it!" :-) Equally, I don't see much value in
pre-acking such change. "I'm fine with becoming insecure at some point".

If we, however, discuss other hints such 'pre-ACK' mechanism may make
sense, however, I'd make it an option to a 'challenge/response'
protocol: if host wants to change a hint it notifies the guest and waits
for an ACK from it (e.g. a pair of MSRs + an interrupt). I, however,
have no good candidate from the existing hints which would require guest
to ACK (e.g revoking PV EOI would probably do but why would we do that?)
As I said before, challenge/response protocol is needed if we'd like to
make TSC frequency change the way Hyper-V does it (required for updating
guest TSC pages in nested case) but this is less and less important with
the appearance of TSC scaling. I'm still not sure if this is an
over-engineering or not. We can wait for the first good candidate to
decide.
