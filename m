Hi all, this is Philip who maintains the 0-Day CI test service.
Thanks for anyone who subscribing to the service. We will have a
major lab construction during next few days, thus need to pause
the service until Jun 11. Sorry for any inconvenience caused by
this, we will try our best to have it online as early as possible.

Thanks
