I am very much against that for the following reason:

 - the current REQ_OP_DISCARD is purely a hint, and implementations can
   (and do) choose to ignore it
 - REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES is an actual data integrity operation with
   everything that entails

Going back to mixing these two will lead to a disaster sooner or later.
