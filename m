Sorry if I sounded like evading, I was just saying that it would be nice to
work on some specific issue or bug report and then figure out what is needed
from there, instead of trying to predict what data is useful. Of course, I
think predicting and dumping data is also useful, but I was just wondering if
you had some specific issue in mind that we could work off of (you did
mention the CPU stopper below so thank you!)

Agreed, these are all good.

In case you have a LKML link to a thread or bug report to this specific
cpu_stopper issue, please do pass it along.

Happy to work on this with Byungchul, thanks,
