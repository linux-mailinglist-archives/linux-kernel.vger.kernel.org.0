Thanks - I did a few more fixes and updates to the comments, this is how 
it ended up looking like (full patch below):

/*
 * 'group_type' describes the group of CPUs at the moment of load balancing.
 *
 * The enum is ordered by pulling priority, with the group with lowest priority
 * first so the group_type can simply be compared when selecting the busiest
 * group. See update_sd_pick_busiest().
 */
enum group_type {
	/* The group has spare capacity that can be used to run more tasks.  */
	group_has_spare = 0,
	/*
	 * The group is fully used and the tasks don't compete for more CPU
	 * cycles. Nevertheless, some tasks might wait before running.
	 */
	group_fully_busy,
	/*
	 * SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY only: One task doesn't fit with CPU's capacity
	 * and must be migrated to a more powerful CPU.
	 */
	group_misfit_task,
	/*
	 * SD_ASYM_PACKING only: One local CPU with higher capacity is available,
	 * and the task should be migrated to it instead of running on the
	 * current CPU.
	 */
	group_asym_packing,
	/*
	 * The tasks' affinity constraints previously prevented the scheduler
	 * from balancing the load across the system.
	 */
	group_imbalanced,
	/*
	 * The CPU is overloaded and can't provide expected CPU cycles to all
	 * tasks.
	 */
	group_overloaded
};

I also added your Acked-by, which I think was implicit? :)

Thanks,

	Ingo

Subject: [PATCH] sched/fair: Add comments for group_type and balancing at SD_NUMA level

Add comments to describe each state of goup_type and to add some details
about the load balance at NUMA level.
