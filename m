Tell us how you really feel about ION :)

This is a central allocator, it is not tied to any one device. If we
knew the one device ahead of time we would just use the existing dma_alloc.

We might be able to solve some of that with late mapping after all the
devices attach to the buffer, but even then, which device's CMA area
would we chose to use from all the attached devices?

I can agree that allocating from per-device CMA using Heaps doesn't make
much sense, but for global pools I'm not sure I see any way to allow
devices to select which pool is right for a specific use. They don't
have the full use-case information like the application does, the
selection needs to be made from the application.
