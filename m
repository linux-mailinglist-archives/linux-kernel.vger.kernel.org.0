Do not consider this an authorative response but based on what I know
of the physical topology, it is not unreasonable to use 32 in the SLIT
table. There is a small latency when accessing another die on the same
socket (details are generation specific). It's not quite a local access
but it's not as much as a traditional remote access either (hence 16 being
the base unit for another die to hint that it's not quite local but not
quite remote either). 32 is based on accessing a die on a remote socket
based on the expected performance and latency of the interconnect.

To the best of my knowledge, the magic numbers are reflective of the real
topology and not just a gamification of the numbers for a random OS. If
anything, the fact that there is a load balancing issue on Linux would
indicate that they were not picking random numbers for Linux at least :P
