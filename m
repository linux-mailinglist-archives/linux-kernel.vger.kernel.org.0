One question I would have is if this is really the desired behavior we
are looking for?

By proactively splitting the THP you are likely going to see a
performance regression with the virtio-balloon driver enabled in QEMU.
I would suspect the response to that would be to update the QEMU code
to  identify the page size of the shared memory ramblock. At that
point I suspect it would start behaving the same as how it currently
handles anonymous memory, and the work done here would essentially
have been wasted other than triggering the desire to resolve this in
QEMU to avoid a performance regression.

The code for inflating a the balloon in virtio-balloon in QEMU can be
found here:
https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/hw/virtio/virtio-balloon.c#L66

If there is a way for us to just populate the value obtained via
qemu_ram_pagesize with the THP page size instead of leaving it at 4K,
which is the size I am assuming it is at since you indicated that it
is just freeing the base page size, then we could address the same
issue and likely get the desired outcome of freeing the entire THP
page when it is no longer used.
