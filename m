I did a casual review, so for whole series with the small nitpicks I had, and any feedback by others, kbuild and the arm mess being fixed up:

Reviewed-by: Maarten Lankhorst <maarten.lankhorst@linux.intel.com>

However, according to reviewer's statement of oversight:

While I have reviewed the patch and believe it to be sound, I do not (unless explicitly stated elsewhere)
make any warranties or guarantees that it will achieve its stated purpose or function properly in any given situation.
