Yes and no.   If we wanted to minimize the amount of wrapping around the
vDSO's ENCLU then we wouldn't have the exit handler shenanigans in the
first place.  The whole process has been about balancing the wants of each
use case against the overall quality of the API and code.

Up until Nathaniel joined the party, the only stakeholder in terms of the
exit handler was the Intel SDK.  There was a general consensus to pass
registers as-is when there isn't a strong reason to do otherwise.  Note
that Nathaniel has also expressed approval of that approach.

So I think the question that needs to be answered is whether the benefits
of using %rcx instead of %rax to pass @leaf justify the "pass registers
as-is" guideline.  We've effectively already given this waiver for %rbx,
as the whole reason why the TCS is passed in on the stack instead of via
%rbx is so that it can be passed to the exit handler.  E.g. the vDSO
could take the TCS in %rbx and save it on the stack, but we're throwing
the baby out with the bathwater at that point.

The major benefits being that the vDSO would be callable from C and that
the kernel could define a legitimate prototype instead of a frankenstein
prototype that's half assembly and half C.  For me, those are significant
benefits and well worth the extra MOV, PUSH and POP.  For some use cases
it would eliminate the need for an assembly wrapper.  For runtimes that
need an assembly wrapper for whatever reason, it's probably still a win as
a well designed runtime can avoid register shuffling in the wrapper.  And
if there is a runtime that isn't covered by the above, it's at worst an
extra MOV.
