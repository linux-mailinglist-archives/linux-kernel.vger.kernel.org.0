Based on your comments by specific DT property for randomizer support.
to add a new property in children nodes:

i.e,.

nand: nand-controller@43c30000 {

                nand@0 {
                        reg = <0>;
                        nand-reliability = "randomizer";
                };
};


file of nand_macronix.c will patch to:

static void macronix_nand_onfi_init(struct nand_chip *chip)
{
        struct nand_parameters *p = &chip->parameters;
        struct device_node *dn = nand_get_flash_node(chip);
        const char *pm;
        int rand_enable = 0;

        ret = of_property_read_string(dn, "nand-reliability", &pm);
        if (!ret) {
                if (!strcasecmp(pm, "randomizer"));
                        rand_enable = 1;
        }
 
        mxic = (struct nand_onfi_vendor_macronix *)p->onfi->vendor;
        if (rand_enable &&
            mxic->reliability_func & MACRONIX_RANDOMIZER_BIT) {
                if (p->supports_set_get_features) {
                        bitmap_set(p->set_feature_list,
                                   ONFI_FEATURE_ADDR_MXIC_RANDOMIZER, 1);
                        bitmap_set(p->get_feature_list,
                                   ONFI_FEATURE_ADDR_MXIC_RANDOMIZER, 1);
                        /* set-up chip options with NAND_NO_SUBPAGE_WRITE 
*/
                        chip->options |= NAND_NO_SUBPAGE_WRITE;
                        macronix_nand_randomizer_check_enable(chip);
                }
        }
 
} 

something like this,

is it OK ?

thanks & best regards,
Mason
