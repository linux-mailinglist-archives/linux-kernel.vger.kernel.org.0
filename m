I know, and I'm not going to argue for a mere division either. I think I
made my point.

Right, my reply was a bit too terse. What I meant is that with patch 8 the
value of env->imbalance is irrelevant when dealing with misfit tasks - we
only check the task's utilization in detach_tasks(), we don't do any
comparison of the task's signals with env->imbalance.

Whether we set the imbalance to the load value and set it to 0 in
detach_tasks() or set it to 1 and decrement it in detach_tasks() gives the
same result. That's why I was saying it conceptually fits with the
migrate_task logic, since we can set the imbalance to 1 (we only want to
migrate one task).
