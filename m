This is very well spotted! I really didn't think of GFP_NOFS although
xfs in the mix could give me some clue.

This deserves more information about the fix. Why is it OK to trigger
OOM for GFP_NOFS allocations? Doesn't this lead to pre-mature OOM killer
invocation?

You can argue that memcg charges have ignored GFP_NOFS without seeing a
lot of problems. But please document that in the changelog.

It is 3da88fb3bacfaa33 that has introduced this heuristic and I have to
confess I haven't realized the side effect on the memcg side because
OOM was triggered only from the GFP_KERNEL context. So I would point
to 3da88fb3bacfaa33 as introducing the regression albeit silent at the
time.

I would say
Fixes: 3da88fb3bacfaa33 # necessary after 29ef680ae7c21110

Other than that I am not really sure about a better fix. Let's see
whether we see some pre-mature memcg OOM reports and think where to get
from there.

With updated changelog
