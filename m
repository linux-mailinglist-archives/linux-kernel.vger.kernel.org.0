IMHO, the most tricky part of numlist API is handling of IDs.
The IDs are there to avoid ABA races when reusing the nodes.

I want to say that this API is useful only when the nodes are reused.
All other users would want anything easier.

This would be append only list. Again the is no need for IDs
and other complexities.

It might be also because nobody else needed structure with
our numlist semantic. I guess that lockless read/write
structures are usually implemented using RCU.

The API is complicated because of the callbacks. It depends on a logic
that is implemented externally. It makes it abstract to some extent.

My view is that the API would be much cleaner and easier to review
when the ID handling is "hardcoded" (helper functions). It could be
made abstract anytime later when there is another user.

There should always be a reason why to make a code more complicated
than necessary. It seems that the only reason is some theoretical
future user and its theoretical requirements.

It might be done a generic way when there is a user with another need.

Honestly, I have big troubles to imagine another reasonable mapping
between id and pointer than masking. We are talking about lockless
code. Anything more complicated might become a nightmare.

The ID is used in all three APIs. Then it might be only a matter of
taste where it is stored.

I still feel that struct nl_node is better place because:

    + already includes next_id
    + includes seq that identifies the structure another way
    + id describes the node

I still need to think more about the other APIs. Well, id
substitutes a pointer here. It is like struct list_head
pointer. It is normal that it is passed as parameter
by a list API user.

Symmetry is really important. It is often sign of a good design.

Simple and straightforward code is another important thing at
this stage. The code is complicated and we need to make sure
that it works. Any optimizations and generalization might
be done later when needed.
