Since CPU model number is one of the early bits of disclosure
in order to get support upstream in time for launch, safe to
assume that some products will not want to advertise everything
that far ahead.

Your other patch series shows that you aren't afraid
of a little churn. So sure, we can go with _NP for now
and fix it up later.  It's not like some OEM is going
to make a CPU selection based on the #define name that
we gave it in Linux :-)
