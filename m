Right.

Correct.

The new place is the final piece of bringup, it is right before where
the freshly woken CPU will drop into the idle loop and start scheduling
(for the first time).

Right, that is right before we run what used to be the CPU_STARTING
notifiers. This is in fact (on x86) before the CPU is marked
cpu_online(). It has to be before cpu_startup_entry(), before this is
ran with IRQs disabled, while cpu_startup_entry() demands IRQs are
enabled.

That makes two of us, afaict we have RCU up and running when we get to
the idle loop.
