I provided two reasons below why we need one
[1] ASoC use of dev->driver
[2] PM hooks.

I would kindly ask that you re-check these points and reply on each, 
thank you. I did not remove them from my reply so that you don't have to 
go back to the previous emails.

no, it's not related to references, it's using the name, see [1]. And 
it's not related to the 'dai driver' which is a separate entity 
unrelated to devices.

the parent-child relationship was used in all cases, I don't understand 
why things would be different, you still need to add hooks in the 
'driver' for the pm of the 'master' child device, be it a platform 
device or not.

I suggested a minimal way of using the 'device_driver' directly in 
https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/pull/1755

I don't understand how a platform device can be PCI/ACPI/OF? what did

Sorry no, your reply just confused me completely.

The recommendation from Greg was "remove platform devices". Here's the 
quote from his May 9, 2019 reply:

"So soundwire is creating platform devices?  Ick, no!  Don't do that,
create a "real" device that is the root of your bus and attach that to
the platform/pci/whatever device that is the parent of that device's
resources."

If your suggestion is to keep platform devices as currently done, then I 
will kindly ask that you speak with Greg and let me know what the 
agreement is.

The second part of your reply gets more confusing, you are suggesting 
that "Intel code will call sdw_add_bus_master() and we would create a 
sdw_master_device for it and add the representation". That is in direct 
contradiction with the notion of using platform devices. And it would by 
construction break the Qualcomm controller code just merged weeks ago. 
Are you suggesting I start changing Qualcomm code? Or that we add a new 
function that does device creation+bus addition in one shot?

And last you didn't acknowledge my two technical points as to why a 
driver is needed for this sdw_master_device.

So I am back to scratching my head on what the direction is? I just do 
not understand your line of thought.

Maybe we need to stop the long sentences and use this decision flow:

a) is the master device a platform device (Yes/No)?
b) if No for a) then
b.1) is the master device created within sdw_add_bus_master()
b.2) is the master device created before calling sdw_add_bus_master()

Can you please clarify what your desired choices are on this last paragraph?

Thanks
-Pierre
