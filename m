Would it be possible to work around that by scheduling
a work item that drops the active_mm?

After all, a work item runs in a kernel thread, so by
the time the work item is run, either the kernel will
still be running the mm you want to get rid of as
active_mm, or it will have already gotten rid of it
earlier.
