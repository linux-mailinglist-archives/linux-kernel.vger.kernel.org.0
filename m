Sorry? Do you expect me to come up with answer to these questions?

I certainly dispute that. If you're able to support all of this in the
kernel, you're most probably able to do it in u-boot, and that's the 
right
place to do it (and that can be a pretty simple u-boot if you use the
original one as a first-stage loader).

I'm not trying to undermine your effort in supporting these platforms
in mainline. This is certainly commendable. But you're unfortunately
pushing in a direction that we've tried hard to move away from for
a good 8 years.

Look at what we did on the Allwinner front: we got a terrible piece of
crap, and turned it into one of the best supported platform, because
we've put the effort where it mattered. I personally wrote PSCI support
and HYP enablement in u-boot, addressing in one go most of the issues 
you
mention here. It didn't take that much time, and it is now there for 
you
to make use of.

Thanks,

         M.
