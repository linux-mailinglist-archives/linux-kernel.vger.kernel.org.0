I will remove the speculation since the slightly extra time is understandable
and not concerning. I hope we agree on that.

I think you mean, slower -> less efficient (due to taking up more grace
period cycles per second in the no batching case). I will update it
accordingly.

Makes sense, and this comes down to 200-220MB range with the additional list.

It was a reasoning like this, added it as a comment:

	/* While measuring kfree_rcu() time, we also end up measuring kmalloc()
	 * time. So the strategy here is to do a few (kfree_alloc_num) number
	 * of kmalloc() and kfree_rcu() every loop so that the current loop's
	 * deferred kfree()ing overlaps with the next loop's kmalloc().
	 */

Will post it soon with other patches on top of -rcu dev.
