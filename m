Do you know of any publicly-available documentation that describes the
"uncorrected" and "corrected" addresses? I got that qfprom address for
the HDMI from here:

https://github.com/AICP/kernel_lge_hammerhead/blob/n7.1/arch/arm/boot/dts/msm8974-mdss.dtsi#L101

I assume the downstream kernel probably doesn't have the corrected
address anywhere else?
