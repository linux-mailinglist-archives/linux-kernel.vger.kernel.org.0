More 4K video rendering speeds with my brand new SGD$230 Galax GeForce GTX1=
650 4 GB GDDR5 video card with hardware encoder:

[1] 2 hours 31 mins of 4K video took 2 hours 50 mins to render

[2] 2 hours 26 mins of 4K video took 2 hours 44 mins to render

[3] 2 hours 27 mins of 4K video took 3 hours 24 mins to render

[4] 2 hours 48 mins of 4K video took 3 hours 15 mins to render

[5] 1 hour 40 mins of 4K video took 4 hours to render (anomaly)

[6] 1 hour 53 mins of 4K video took 2 hours 7 mins to render

[7] 1 hour 37 mins of 4K video took 1 hour 48 mins to render

[8] 1 hour 46 mins of 4K video took 2 hours 3 mins to render

[9] Forgot to record details

[10] Forgot to record details

Previously, for the past many many many years, 2 hours of 4K video took MOR=
E THAN 10 hours to render with my old, ultra cheapo Sapphire AMD Radeon HD =
6450 video card in my 5th generation Intel Core i7-5820K home desktop compu=
ter. Since the year 2015 or perhaps even much earlier, it used to take me a=
 very very very long time to upload combined and rendered videos to YouTube=
 after recording them. Because of my poor finances I couldn't afford to upg=
rade to a 10th generation Intel Core processor computer system or buy a far=
 more expensive gaming video card (typically costing SGD$1000 or more), eve=
n though I am a good university graduate from the National University of Si=
ngapore (NUS) with a Diploma in Computer Networking from Singapore Polytech=
nic.

With effect from 29 September 2019 Sunday, this lingering problem has been =
resolved with my brand new SGD$230 Galax GeForce GTX1650 4 GB GDDR5 video c=
ard with hardware encoder.

Subject: Galax GeForce GTX1650 EX-1 Click OC PCI-E 4 GB GDDR5 128Bit Video =
Card Improves 4K Video Rendering Speeds by LEAPS AND BOUNDS!

Good day from Singapore,

I have just bought a Galax GeForce GTX1650 EX-1 Click OC PCI-E 4 GB GDDR5 1=
28Bit with/Display Port/HDMI/DVI-D/CoolingFan video card for SGD$230 (after=
 some bargaining) at a 4th story computer shop in Sim Lim Square in Singapo=
re,Singapore on 29th September 2019 Sunday Singapore Time.

Prior to buying the above-mentioned video card, I was using the Sapphire AM=
D Radeon HD6450 video card. Rendering a 2-hour 4K video with this ultra che=
apo video card (GPU acceleration of video processing TURNED OFF) took MORE =
THAN TEN (10) hours!

The technical specifications of my ancient and primitive home desktop compu=
ter are:

[01] 5th Generation Intel Core i7-5820K Extreme Edition Processor with 6 co=
res and 12 threads @ 3.30 GHz

[02] MSI X99A SLI Krait Edition Motherboard LGA2011-3 Socket with Intel X99=
 chipset

[03] 32 GB DDR4 Memory (Mixture of 4 sticks of Crucial and Kingston DDR4 me=
mory sticks)

[04] Windows 10 Home Edition version 1803 64-bit

[05] Vegas Movie Studio 15.0 Platinum video rendering software

As of 30th September 2019 Monday Singapore Time, Intel Corporation has alre=
ady released 10th Generation Intel Core processors. I am truly very sorry t=
hat I am not able to afford upgrading from 5th Generation Intel Core proces=
sor systems to 10th Generation Intel Core processor systems. Hence I have t=
o make do with buying Galax GeForce GTX1650 EX-1 Click OC PCI-E 4 GB GDDR5 =
128Bit video card for SGD$230 at the moment.

After removing the Sapphire AMD Radeon HD6450 video card from my home deskt=
op computer, I installed the brand new Galax GeForce GTX1650 EX-1 Click OC =
PCI-E 4 GB GDDR5 128Bit video card immediately. Upon booting up Windows 10 =
Home Edition, I quickly turned on GPU Acceleration of Video Processing in V=
egas Movie Studio 15.0 Platinum. I would choose all 4K video rendering temp=
lates with "NVIDIA NVENC".

From Wikipedia:

[QUOTE] Nvidia NVENC is a feature in its graphics cards that performs video=
 encoding, offloading this compute-intensive task from the CPU. It was intr=
oduced with the Kepler-based GeForce 600 series in March 2012.[1][2]

The encoder is supported in many streaming and recording programs, such as =
Wirecast, Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) and Bandicam, and also works with=
 Share game capture, which is included in Nvidia's GeForce Experience softw=
are.[3][4][5]

Consumer targeted GeForce graphics cards officially support no more than 2 =
simultaneously encoding video streams, regardless of the count of the cards=
 installed, but this restriction can be circumvented on Linux and Windows s=
ystems by applying an unofficial patch to the drivers[6]. Professional card=
s support between 2 and 21 simultaneous streams per card, depending on card=
 model and compression quality.[1] [/QUOTE]

And WOW! Rendering a 2 hour 19 minute 4K Ultra HD video (taken with my Sams=
ung NX500 4K camera) with Galax GeForce GTX1650 EX-1 Click OC PCI-E 4 GB GD=
DR5 128Bit video card took only 3 hours and 30 minutes!!! This is a vast an=
d tremendous improvement from the past of taking MORE THAN 10 hours to rend=
er a 2-hour 4K video without any GPU Acceleration of video processing!

What do you think would happen if I am able to afford upgrading to a 10th G=
eneration Intel Core home desktop computer?

Greetings from Singapore!
