Hi Greg,

Actually, there are two reasons why we've chosen the "Segment:Root Bus" 
notion to
represent Root port to IO PMU mapping:
1. it meets feature requirements to uniquely identify each Root Port on 
the system
2. that notion - "Segment:Root Bus" - is already used by the kernel to 
represent
Root ports is sysfs; see commit 37d6a0a6f4700 and example below taken for
Intel Xeon V5 (Skylake Server):

# ls /sys/devices/ | grep pci
pci0000:00
pci0000:17
pci0000:3a
pci0000:5d
pci0000:80
pci0000:85
pci0000:ae
pci0000:d7

Having full conventional PCI address in the form of 
"Segment:Bus:Device.Function"
is just not required to distinguish one Root Bus from the other.
But if there is any other agreement regarding the way how PCI Root ports are
supposed to show up in the sysfs then please let us know.

Thanks,
Roman
