Shall we revert c894e33ddc1910e14d6f2a2016f60ab613fd8b37 and then Alan
could send a patch providing the desired behaviour in ->set_uhs_signaling()
of the relevant driver e.g.

void ???_set_uhs_signaling(struct sdhci_host *host, unsigned int timing)
{
	if (timing == MMC_TIMING_SD_HS || timing == MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS)
		timing = MMC_TIMING_UHS_SDR25;
	sdhci_set_uhs_signaling(host, timing);
}
