Technically speaking, hub_tt_work is used by the hub driver, not by 
usb-storage.  :-)

Yes, it needs to use a work queue with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM set.  
Unfortunately, I don't think we can use hub_wq for this purpose (we
could end up with a work item waiting for another work item later on in
the same queue, not good).
