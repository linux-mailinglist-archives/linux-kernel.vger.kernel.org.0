The resources are pinned by the reference count. Making a special case
will certainly mess up the existing code.

It is actually a problem for systems that are mostly idle. Only the
kernel->kernel case needs to be updated. If the CPUs isn't busy running
user tasks, a little bit more overhead shouldn't really hurt IMHO.
