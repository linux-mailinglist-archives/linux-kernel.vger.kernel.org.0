Okay. The GUP functions are not properly documented for my taste. There
is no indication whether or not the mm_sem has to be acquired prior
invoking it. Following the call chain of get_user_pages() I ended up in
__get_user_pages_locked() `locked = NULL' indicated that mm_sem is no
acquired and then I saw this:
|                 if (!locked)
|                         /* VM_FAULT_RETRY couldn't trigger, bypass */
|                         return ret;

kind of suggesting that it is okay to invoke it without holding the
mm_sem prefault. It passed a few tests and then
	https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1556657902.6132.13.camel@lca.pw

happened. After that, I switched to the locked variant and the problem
disappeared (also I noticed that MPX code is invoked within ->mmap()).

I need to poke at that. I has been removed but then KVM folks complained
that they kind of depend on that if it has been exposed to the guest. We
need to fade it out slowlyâ€¦

oki.

yes, because size >= fpu_user_xstate_size

no, we first check the range and then write. It is later checked again
after the size has been extended.
