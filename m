This is the thing that can't really be done with PL011.  The only way to
trigger a TX FIFO interrupt is to fill the TX FIFO and wait for it to
drain back to the threshold.

SBSA UART is particularly dumb in this regard: you can't disable the
FIFOs, change the irq trigger thresholds or do anything else that might
help here.

Historically, the PL011 was configured for maximum speed and put in
loopback mode to send some initial dummy chars and bootstrap the
interrupt state machine, but this has problems with some newer variants,
and doesn't work at all with SBSA uart.

I think it's the spin_lock_irq(&uap->port.lock) done by serial_core
around pl011_start_tx() that we're relying on here.

This protects us against most potential races.

The trickiest path is when we are in pl011_int() having temporarily
released the lock, and pl011_start_tx() gets called on another cpu.

One thing that makes me uneasy is that there is one thing other than
pl011_int() than can clear uap->im &= ~UART011_TXIM: pl011_stop_tx() is
also called from uart_stop(), which the TTY layer may call at random
times for flow control reasons.

pl011_int() can miss this change and and write the FIFO a final time,
but pl011_start_tx_pio() can now race even with my patch (because TXIM
is now clear) and overfill the FIFO.

This problem arises from the cached interrupt status bits becoming
stale while the lock is released.

We might be able to solve this just be reordering pl011_int() so that
the un-locky rx handing code is done after the TX handling.

Does this make sense?

Ack!  These things are properly fiddly to get right.  Please do try to
shoot holes in the code :)

I am still trying to resurrect my understanding of how this code
works...
