That is the actual problem! Some aux devices does not have dais.

Problem is that aux devices(amplifier) are dai less but connected via 
SoundWire. So question is how do we attach those SoundWire streams to 
SoundWire master stream?

My Idea was to get handle to the SoundWire stream from controller dai 
and adding these aux SoundWire slave devices as slave to them in machine 
driver. This was much less intrusive than other solutions.

Is there a better way to associate a dai-less codecs to SoundWire master 
stream?

In this particular board setup. Soundwire master is allocating the 
stream runtime for each of it dais, and this runtime is used in machine 
driver to attach Auxdev Soundwire slaves.

Other setups where the codec has dai should work as expected!

Am open for any suggestions on dealing with dai less setups like what we 
have on our board.
