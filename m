In my case it's mostly #1. The two IOASID sets (SVA and AUX) are managed
by different modules (iommu-sva and arm-smmu-v3). Since we don't do
scalable IOV, the two sets are shared_ioasid and private_ioasid, with
either an mm or NULL as private data (but we might need to store a
domain for private IOASIDs at some point). So at the moment passing a
NULL set to ioasid_find() would work for us as well.

However in a non-virtualization scenario, a device driver could define
its own set and allocate an IOASID for its own use, associating some
private structure with it. If it somehow causes a PRQ on that IOASID,
the IOMMU driver shouldn't attempt to access the device driver's private
structure. So I do think we need to be careful with global
ioasid_find(). Given that any driver in the system can use the
allocator, we won't be able to keep assuming that all objects stored in
there are of one type.

Thanks for the explanation, I think I understand a little better after
taking a closer look at your v4.

Sure, let's revisit this later

Thanks,
