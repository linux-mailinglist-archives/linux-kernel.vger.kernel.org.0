I assumed the vga writing only take effect when earlyprintk is provided.
eg. earlyprintk=ttyS0, then x86 early decompress code will write to both
vga and ttyS0.  So if one does not use earlyprintk, he/she still get
nothing.  But if one provides earlyprintk, then he/she should provide a
correct param he want, instead of blindly assume kernel will write to
vga even if he use ttyS0.

Thanks
