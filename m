The flag is very easy to understand but the interface is not,
especially the assumption that add_timer_on() must be used to
guarantee a correct behavior.

For example, currently if we setup a pinned timer but later on we call
mod_timer() upon the pinned timer, the mod_timer() will still try to
run the timer on the current processor and migrate the timer if
necessary.  In other words, the suggested way to arm a pinned timer
should be add_timer_on() always.  mod_timer() can be used in this case
only if current processor is the one that we want to pin the timer on.

Document it a bit with the definition of TIMER_PINNED so that all
future users will use it correctly.
