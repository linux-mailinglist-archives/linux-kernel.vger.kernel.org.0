Well the recommendation was to add a device, so adding sdw_master_device
was the right approach. But we don't need to add driver as well.

Yes ASoC does require the DAI driver as it holds a reference to it. That
was the reason we have a platform device and a platform driver for
"int-sdw".

Would it make sense to keep this as is and then export the init and
startup APIs which can be invoked by SOF part for hardware
initialization. So driver loading is a separate step from hardware
initialization and sequencing.

Also you continue with the benefit of parent-child relations for this
device :) and pm should be simpler.

Btw this helps if ever in future you have a separate instance of sdw
controller that can be just hooked to acpi/pci/whatever device part and
driver works without big plumbing

So there are two things, lets discuss them independently. One is the
device behind the controller object. I think I have given a
recommendation above to keep the existing platform device for "int-sdw".
This device can be PCI/ACPI/OF/Platform, we typically should not worry
about it.

Second is we create the bus instance and that also create the
sdw_master_device to represent the soundwire master device in sysfs,
since this would be done by soundwire core (as I suggested), it would be
independent of which type of driver is invoking this. In fact this needs
to be completely independent of the driver calling this.

Intel code will call sdw_add_bus_master() and we would create a
sdw_master_device for it and add the representation. So would the qcom
code (btw with this, we wont need to do anything on qc code and it
'should just work (tm)'.

The vision I am thinking is that sdw_master_device is a representation
of master for everyone independent of the platform it is being used.

Let me know if this helps
