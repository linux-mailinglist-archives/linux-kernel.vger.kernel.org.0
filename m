I agree with your argument in the case where both read-side and write-side
are protected by the same lock: READ/WRITE_ONCE are useless then. However,
in the scenario we have here, only the write-side is protected by the lock
against concurrent updates, but reads don't take any lock.

If WRITE_ONCE has any use at all (protecting against store tearing and
invented stores), it should be used even with a lock held in this
scenario, because the lock does not prevent READ_ONCE() from observing
transient states caused by lack of WRITE_ONCE() for the update.

So why does WRITE_ONCE exist in the first place ? Is it for documentation
purposes only or are there actual situations where omitting it can cause
bugs with real-life compilers ?

In terms of code change, should we favor only introducing WRITE_ONCE
in new code, or should existing code matching those conditions be
moved to WRITE_ONCE as bug fixes ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
