Thanks for your comments.

In the case you said, the number of loops required to traverse all
nodes is similar to traversing all zones.

I have two main reasons to explain that this series of patches is
beneficial.

1. When node has more than one zone, it will take fewer cycles to
traverse all nodes. (for example, ZONE_MOVABLE?)

2. Using zonelist to traverse all nodes is inefficient, pgdat must be
obtained indirectly via zone->zone_pgdat, and additional judgment must
be made.

E.g
1) Using zonelist to traverse all nodes

	last_pgdat = NULL;	
	for_each_zone_zonelist(zone, xxx) {
		pgdat = zone->zone_pgdat;
		if (pgdat == last_pgdat)
			continue;

		last_pgdat = pgdat;
		do_something(pgdat);
	}

2) Using nodelist to traverse all nodes

	for_each_node_nodelist(node, xxx) {
		do_something(NODE_INFO(node));
	}
