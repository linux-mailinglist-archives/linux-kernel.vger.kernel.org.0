Thanks for the detailed response.


In current implementation of v1, I am not doing any read barrier, Hence, 
using the non-relaxed will add unneeded memory barrier.

I have no strong objection moving to the non-relaxed version and have an 
unneeded memory barrier, as this path is not "hot" one.


Beside of avoiding the unneeded memory barrier, I would be happy to keep 
common behavior for our drivers:

e.g.

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/irqchip/irq-al-fic.c#L49


So what do you think we should go with? relaxed or non-relaxed?
