Subject: [PATCH 01/23] perf vendor events s390: Add new deflate counters for IBM z15
Date:   Tue, 17 Mar 2020 18:32:37 -0300

From: Thomas Richter <tmricht@linux.ibm.com>

Add support for new deflate counters:

- Counter 247: cycles CPU spent obtaining access to Deflate unit
- Counter 252: cycles CPU is using Deflate unit
- Counter 264: Increments by one for every DEFLATE CONVERSION CALL
	    instruction executed.
- Counter 265: Increments by one for every DEFLATE CONVERSION CALL
	    instruction executed that ended in Condition Codes
	    0, 1 or 2.

Also adjust the some crypto counter description to latest documentation.
