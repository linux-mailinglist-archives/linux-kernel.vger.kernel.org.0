> Why isn't this based off of 'struct driver'?

It's not a real driver, in a sense that there's no underlying
device. None of the usual driver stuff applies. It's still a set of
callbacks, though. Should this be an elaborate comment, should I replace
the word "driver" with something else?

I'd really like to avoid shoehorning the whole 'struct device' + 'struct
driver' here.

Thanks,
