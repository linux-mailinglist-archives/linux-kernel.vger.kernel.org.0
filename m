I'm lost with the constraints we want to set.

We can still support fork() if we take a step back from v20 and require
the mmap(). Given the recent comments, I'd guess that is the best
compromise i.e. multiple processes can still share an enclave within
the limitations of ancestor hierarchy. Is this the constraint we agree
now upon? Some emails are a bit contradicting in this sense.

Dropped off here completely. What if the mmap() is done before any of
the EADD operations?

This looks flakky and error prone. You'd better have some "shadow VMAs"
and check that you have such matching size of the VMA you try to mmap()
and check flags from that.

Who would call this function anyhow and when?

Would be better to first agree on constraints. I have zero idea within
which kind of enviroment this snippet would live e.g.

- mmap() (before, after?)
- multi process constraint (only fork or full on versatility)
