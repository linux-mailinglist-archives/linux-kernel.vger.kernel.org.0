Who is "they" and what is needed to support this device and why wait a
full year?

That's not the issue here.  The issue is that we keep adding the same
huge driver files to the kernel tree, over and over, with no real change
at all.  We have seen almost all of these files in other realtek
drivers, right?  Why not use the ones we already have?

But better yet, why not add proper support for this hardware and not use
a staging driver?
