One thing imported need to be mentioned here, user kernel kexec into
kdump kernel using the fast path, which does very few things, and
leave all the PCI devices untouched. If they are on, or doing DMA,
will just keep doing that, nothing will stop them.

In most cases the on going DMA seems harmless though, as kdump kernel
only live in reserved crash memory.

Yes everything else all correct. On the machine I can reproduce it,
system just hanged, even serial console is dead with no output.

That is just what is happening. When kdump kernel try to reboot, it
only cleared bus mastering bit of the Root Port, ignoring enabled
device under it, because it's not the kdump kernel that enabled the
device, it's the first kernel enabled it, and kdump kernel don't know
it.

Maybe if we can solve the problem by properly shutdown the devices in
right order, then better don't disable any error handling features? Or
kernel might miss some real hardware issue.
