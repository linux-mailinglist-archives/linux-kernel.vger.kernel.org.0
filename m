That's the Sub-NUMA Clustering, right? I thought that manifested as a
separate NUMA node in Linux. Not exactly right from a topology point of
view, but close enough. Still, you're right in that identifying the LLC
specifically would not necessarily be the way to go. FWIW, I have one
machine with SNC enabled and didn't notice anything problematic in the
versions of the patch released to date.

Ok, even though they're older, it's enough counter-examples to be concerned
about. I'm definitely dropping the LLC considerations for the moment :)

Even so, I think it should not be part of the initial patch. I would only
be happy if I had enough different machine types to prove that specific
special casing is required and we cannot simply rely on standard load
balancing of the domains below SD_NUMA.

Not quite -- I had a minimum allowed imbalance of 2 tasks -- mostly for
very small NUMA domains. By v3, it was not necessary because the value
was hard-coded regardless of the number of CPUs. I think I'll leave it
out because I don't think it's worth worrying about the imbalance between
NUMA domains of less than 4 CPUs (do they even exist any more?)

Allowing just 1 extra task would work for netperf in some cases except when
softirq is involved. It would partially work for IO on ext4 as it's only
communicating with one journal thread but a bit more borderline for XFS
due to workqueue usage. XFS is not a massive concern in this context as
the workqueue is close to the IO issuer and short-lived so I don't think
it would crop up much for load balancing unlike ext4 where jbd2 could be
very active.

If v4 of the patch fails to meet approval then I'll try a patch that
allows a hard-coded imbalance of 2 tasks (one communicating task and
one kthread) regardless of NUMA domain span up to 50% of utilisation
and see what that gets. One way or the other, I would like to get basic
NUMA balancing issue out of the way before even looking at NUMA balancing
and whether it needs to be adjusted based on the load balancing rewrite.
NUMA balancing already has some logic that fights load balancer decisions
and I don't want to make that worse, I would be delighted if we could
even delete that migration retry check that overrides the load balancer
because it always was a bit nasty.
