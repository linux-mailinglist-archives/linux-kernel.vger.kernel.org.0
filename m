That suggests that the reclaim couldn't meet the given reclaim target
but later attempts just made it through. Is this due to amount of dirty
pages or what prevented the reclaim to do its job?

While I am not against the reclaim retry loop I would like to understand
the underlying issue. Because if this is really about dirty memory then
we should probably be more pro-active in flushing it. Otherwise the
retry might not be of any help.
