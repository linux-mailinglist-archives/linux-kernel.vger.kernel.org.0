Thanks of this information.
At my end on archlinux I also tried to update my initramfs to
add support for *pwm-meson* to but it did not work for me.

Well I have tied to add this command  *initcall_debug* to kernel command prompt.
Here is the console log,  but I did not see any init kernel timer logs

Kernel command line: console=ttyAML0,115200n8
root=PARTUUID=45d7d61e-01 rw rootwait
earlyprintk=serial,ttyAML0,115200 initcall_debug printk.time=y

It look like some clk issue after I added the *clk_ignore_unused* to
kernel command line
it booted further to login prompt and cpufreq DVFS seem to be loaded.
So I could conclude this is clk issue.below is the boot log

Kernel command line: console=ttyAML0,115200n8
root=PARTUUID=45d7d61e-01 rw rootwait
earlyprintk=serial,ttyAML0,115200 initcall_debug printk.time=y
clk_ignore_unused

Yep yesterday my focus was to disable PWM feature and get boot up-to
login prompt
But not I have to look into clk feature.

*Many thanks for your valuable inputs, I learned a lot of things.*
