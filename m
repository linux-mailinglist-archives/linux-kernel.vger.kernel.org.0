Yes, as I said in my reply to Aneesh, that is the other way I thought
when fixing it.
The reason I went this way is because it seemed more reasonable and
natural to me that pfn_valid() would just return the next active
sub-section.

I just though that we could leverage the fact that we can deactivate
a sub-section before scanning for the next one.

On a second thought, the changes do not outweight the case, being the first
fix enough and less intrusive, so I will send a v2 with that instead.
