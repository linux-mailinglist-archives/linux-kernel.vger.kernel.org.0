Maybe. It costs some extra code for another argument push and a bunch
of cycles to process the %s at run time though (if triggered).

The profile timer setup is not commonly used, so in most typical
builds there is no scope for coalescing the same string. So in the end
most builds will be a few bytes larger with the separated strings.

But really that is not the point. It just seems simpler and clearer to
me to put the string in place - all in one.

I expect it will never fail this early in boot.
But how will you know if it really is EBUSY if you don't print it out?

Hmm, in my experience the much more common pattern is:

Where the pr_err() could be one of pr_err, printk, dev_err, ...
