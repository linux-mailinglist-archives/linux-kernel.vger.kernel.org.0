Yes. Several months ago we got reports that LMKD got very aggressive
killing more processes in situations which did not require that many
kills to recover from memory pressure. After investigation we tracked
it to the bulk killing which would kill too many processes during a
memory usage spike. When killing gradually the kills would be avoided,
so we had to get back to a more balanced approach. The conceptual
issue with bulk killing is that you can't cancel it when device
recovers quicker than you expected.
