Sorry, I did not explain this explicitly. When we change a new PWM
configuration, the PWM controller will make sure the current period is
completed before changing to a new period. Once setting the MOD
register (since we always set MOD firstly), that will tell the
hardware that a new period need to change.

The reason MOD must be configured before DUTY is that, if we
configured DUTY firstly, the PWM can work abnormally if the current
DUTY is larger than previous MOD. That is also our hardware's
limitation.

Make sense, I will change to:

struct pwm_state *cstate =3D pwm->state;

So you mean just return pwmchip_remove(&spc->chip); ?
