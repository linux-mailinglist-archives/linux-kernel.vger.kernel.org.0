Don't you find perf list is swamped with all the uncore events?

For Huawei platform, I find this:
./perf list pmu | grep "Kernel PMU event" | grep hisi | wc -l
648

That's because we have so many instances of the same PMUs, not because 
there are many events per PMU.

TBH, I would like to delete all the events from the hisi uncore kernel 
drivers, now that they're supported in the perf tool, but I think that 
would constitute an ABI breakage.

Maybe there is a way to hide them, but I couldn't find it.
