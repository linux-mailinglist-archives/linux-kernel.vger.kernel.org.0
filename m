I *think* this is plumbed much more directly to userspace:

$ cat /proc/$$/syscall
61 0xffffffff 0x7ffccf734ed0 0xa 0x0 0x1 0x0 0x7ffccf734eb8 0x7f0667465eda

That entire feature is highly dubious and I suppose we could just
delete it.  But right now, we at least pretend that we can tell,
totally asynchronously, whether another task is in a syscall.  Unless
we do *something*, though, I think you shouldn't make this change.

Sticking 0 in the error_code field in ucontext for a signal with no
error code seems entirely harmless to me in contrast.
