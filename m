Right. And the idea is that pme_test_cpu[] can be used as generic set of 
events for testing on any arch/cpuid. (note: I'll just ignore uncore 
events for the moment)

No, we use pme_test_cpu[] to generate the event aliases for a PMU, and 
verify that the aliases are as expected.

Not exactly.

So consider the "cpu" HW PMU. During normal operation, we create the 
event aliases for this PMU in pmu_lookup()->pmu_add_cpu_aliases(). This 
step looks up a map of cpu events for that CPUID, and then creates the 
event aliases for that PMU from that map.

I want the test to recreate this and verify that the events from the 
test JSONs will have event aliases created properly.

So in the test when we scan the PMUs and find "cpu" HW PMU, we create a 
test PMU with the same name, create the event aliases from 
pme_test_cpu[] for that test PMU, and then verify that the event aliases 
created are as expected. Then the test PMU is deleted.

So overall the test covers:
a. jevents code to generate the struct pmu_event []
b. util/pmu.c code to create the event aliases for a given PMU

Note: the test does not (yet) cover matching of events declared in the 
HW PMU sysfs folder. I'm talking about these, for example:

$ ls /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu/events/
branch-instructions  cache-references  el-abort     el-start 
ref-cycles     ...

Let's just concentrate on core PMU ATM :)

Thanks,
