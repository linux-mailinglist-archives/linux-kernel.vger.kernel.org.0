In fact on SMP systems this would result in a very nice optimization: 
pretty quickly *all* TSS's would be populated with that single task's 
bitmap, and it would persist even across migrations from CPU to CPU.

I'd love to get rid of the offset caching and bit scanning games as well 
- it doesn't really help in a number of common scenarios and it 
complicates this non-trivial piece of code a *LOT* - and we probably 
don't really have the natural testing density of this code anymore to 
find any regressions quickly.

So intuitively I'd suggest we gravitate towards the simplest 
implementation, with a good caching optimization for the single-task 
case.

I.e. the model I'm suggesting is that if a task uses ioperm() or iopl() 
then it should have a bitmap from that point on until exit(), even if 
it's all zeroes or all ones. Most applications that are using those 
primitives really need it all the time and are using just a few ioports, 
so all the tracking doesn't help much anyway.

On a related note, another simplification would be that in principle we 
could also use just a single bitmap and emulate iopl() as an ioperm(all) 
or ioperm(none) calls. Yeah, it's not fully ABI compatible for mixed 
ioperm()/iopl() uses, but is that ABI actually being relied on in 
practice?

Thanks,

	Ingo
