I don't think that's confusing if its well documented. Have the user
flag called "force_absolute_timestamps", that way it's not something
that the user will think that we wont have absolute timestamps if it is
zero. Have the documentation say:

 Various utilities within the tracing system require that the ring
 buffer uses absolute timestamps. But you may force the ring buffer to
 always use it, which will give you unique timings with nested tracing
 at the cost of more usage in the ring buffer.
