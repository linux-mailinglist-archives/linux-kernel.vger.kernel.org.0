Do we want a new framework ? I think that is the first question that
should be answer here. Accelerator are in many forms and so far they
never have been enough commonality to create a framework, even GPUs
with the drm is an example of that, drm only offer share framework
for the modesetting part of the GPU (as thankfully monitor connector
are not specific to GPU brands :))

FPGA is another example the only common code expose to userspace is
about bitstream management AFAIK.

I would argue that a framework should only be created once there is
enough devices with same userspace API. Meanwhile you can provide
in kernel helper that allow driver to expose same API. If after a
while we have enough device driver which all use that same in kernel
helpers API then it will a good time to introduce a new framework.
Meanwhile this will allow individual device driver to tinker with
their API and maybe get to something useful to more devices in the
end.

Note that what i propose also allow userspace code sharing for all
driver that use the same in kernel helper.

Cheers,
Jérôme
