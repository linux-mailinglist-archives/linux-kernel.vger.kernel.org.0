Yes it doesn't really provide a sensible result but does it matter?

What would we do about the warning? There are only three ways to go
about this a) reguire power of two nr_pages and always align to that b)
do not restrict nr_pages and align implicitly to what makes sense (power
of two on proper size and arbitrary page aligned otherwise) and c) allow
an explicit alignment.

The simplest way forward is b) because that doesn't really require any
code changes. And I thought the main point of this patch was to provide
something as simple as possible. a) would be only slightly more
complicated but I am wondering why should be restrict the size of the
allocation when there is nothing inherent to do so.
