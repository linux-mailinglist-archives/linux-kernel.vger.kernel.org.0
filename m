Thanks for the pointer - that had passed me by as it doesn't seem to 
have been CCed to the IOMMU list or me as a reviewer.

OK, that's good - I wasn't sure off-hand, and I was on the wrong machine 
to go digging into the source.

...which is exactly why I'd prefer to see a stronger justification for 
making a change which only benefits performance on large systems, while 
potentially impacting usability on small ones.

Because it's actually a reasonable proxy for "system size" in this 
context - there aren't many good reasons for a driver to maintain 
hundreds of mappings of the *same* buffer, so in general the maximum 
number of live mappings is effectively going to scale with the total 
amount of memory, particularly at the smaller end. Consider it a pretty 
safe assumption that an embedded system with RAM measured in megabytes 
won't ever be running anything like an MLX4, let alone in a debug 
situation. If those 256,000 mappings each represent a typical network 
packet, that implies well over 300MB of data alone, not to mention the 
size of the queues themselves, the actual DMA debug entries, and the 
whole rest of the kernel beyond that one driver - I doubt it's 
physically possible to 'need' 64K hash buckets without at very least 1GB 
of total RAM, quite likely much more.

...and when that represents ~5% of the total system RAM it is a *lot* 
less reasonable than even 12KB. As I said, it's great to make a debug 
option more efficient such that what it observes is more representative 
of the non-debug behaviour, but it mustn't come at the cost of making 
the entire option unworkable for other users.
