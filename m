Good point.

The effect from RCU's viewpoint will be to split any non-rcu_read_lock()
RCU read-side critical section at this point.  This alrady happens in a
few places, for example, rcu_note_context_switch() constitutes an RCU
quiescent state despite being invoked with interrupts disabled (as is
required!).  The __schedule() function just needs to understand (and does
understand) that the RCU read-side critical section that would otherwise
span that call to rcu_node_context_switch() is split in two by that call.

However, if this was instead an rcu_read_lock() critical section within
a PREEMPT=y kernel, then if a schedule() occured within stop_one_task(),
RCU would consider that critical section to be preempted.  This means
that any RCU grace period that is blocked by this RCU read-side critical
section would remain blocked until stop_one_cpu() resumed, returned,
and so on until the matching rcu_read_unlock() was reached.  In other
words, RCU would consider that RCU read-side critical section to span
the call to stop_one_cpu() even if stop_one_cpu() invoked schedule().

On the other hand, within a PREEMPT=n kernel, the call to schedule()
would split even an rcu_read_lock() critical section.  Which is why I
asked earlier if sleeping_lock_inc() and sleeping_lock_dec() are no-ops
in !PREEMPT_RT_BASE kernels.  We would after all want the usual lockdep
complaints in that case.

Does that help, or am I missing the point?

							Thanx, Paul
