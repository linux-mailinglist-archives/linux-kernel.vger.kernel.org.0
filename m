Several people are currently working on improving libabigail's
capabilities to deal with the kernel binaries. That ranges from fixes
for newer kernel versions or fixes for binaries built with clang to
performance improvements to better integrate the tool into build
processes etc. There is still some work to do to be an actual
replacement for what is used right now to detect ABI incompatibilities.
But things look promising. The work that is done there is supposed to
address general issues, not just Android. In particular, libabigail
should be able to reliably keep track of the observable in-kernel ABI of
the kernel binaries to detect potential incompatibilities with
previously released kernel binaries. Please note, that this all happens
after the build by inspecting binaries. As opposed to other solutions,
in its current form, libabigail does not introduce any checks at
runtime (i.e. module load time).

There are discussions about this topic scheduled at Plumber's in the
Distro MC and the Android MC.
