Unless U-boot has mailbox framework or you are importing it, it's better
to keep U-boot implementation simple as SMC transport which I think you
already do. I had a look at the implementation[1], it shouldn't change
much other than if you prefer not to use "mailbox" terminology. I don't
understand the reason for even using the mailbox term there in the first
place.
