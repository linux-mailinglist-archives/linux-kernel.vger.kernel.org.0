Subject: [PATCH] cgroup/cpuset: Fix a race condition when reading cpuset.*

LTP cpuset_hotplug_test.sh was failing with the following error message

	cpuset_hotplug 1 TFAIL: root group's cpus isn't expected(Result: 0-5, Expect: 0,2-5).

Which is due to a race condition between cpu hotplug operation and
reading cpuset.cpus file.

When a cpu is onlined/offlined, cpuset schedules a workqueue to sync its
internal data structures with the new values. If a read happens during
this window, the user will read a stale value, hence triggering the
failure above.

To fix the issue make sure cpuset_wait_for_hotplug() is called before
allowing any value to be read, hence forcing the synchronization to
happen before the read.

I ran 500 iterations with this fix applied with no failure triggered.

I think it's okay to flush the workqueue from the read context? We do it on the
write, so I assumed it's okay on the read too. But it'd be good to confirm it
doesn't break any rule I'm not aware of.
