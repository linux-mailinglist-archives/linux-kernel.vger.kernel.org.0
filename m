AFBC modifiers are currently under Arm's namespace, the thought behind the DRM
modifiers would be to have it as a "generic" modifier.

Maybe Ayan could've been a bit clearer in his message, but the ask here is for ideas
on how userspace "communicates" (stores?) the fact that the buffers are protected to
the kernel driver. In our display processor we need to the the hardware that the
buffers are protected before it tries to fetch them so that it can 1) enable the
additional hardware signaling that sets the protection around the stream; and 2) read
the protected buffers in a special mode where there the magic happens.

So yeah, we know we do want full userspace support, we're prodding the community on
answers on how to best let the kernel side know what userspace has done.

Liviu
