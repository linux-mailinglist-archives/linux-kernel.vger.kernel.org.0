OK, so the usecase is when a NUMA node gains a new CPU which wasn't
there at the time when the node got onlined. Is this a scenario we
really do care about? While not completely impossible I haven't seen
a system which would allow such a runtime configurability. Maybe it
would be simply easier to drop the callback for now until we have a real
world usecase to support it and have it documented.
