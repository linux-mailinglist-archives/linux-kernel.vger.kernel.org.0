So this is to officially states our policy that if out-of-tree driver
developers need some symbol exposed, they should work with  upstream to
find better solution. Not for fixing some kind of security hole.

Fair enough.

No, I don't. :)

Agreed. Just for discouraging abuse of unexposed symbols, I think this is
enough.
