I recommended to use it in the previous thread, because of simplicity.
Since it has to hide from userspace and modules, it needs to modify
kernel command line. But the bootconfig can make it simple, and it
also architecture independent.

FYI, I backported bootconfig with boot-time tracer for 4.19 stable kernel
recently.

The bootconfig itself is designed as a generic feature. I had tried to use
devicetree, but that was rejected. Thus I made it as a "software
configuration tree" (but far simpler.)
 
If you have any review comment on the bootconfig, always welcome!
Seriously, I would like to have more comments. I want to make it better.

Thank you,
