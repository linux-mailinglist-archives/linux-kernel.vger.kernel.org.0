You are requesting a UI change here. Maybe the kernel shouldn't be the
one figuring out UI.

I mean, as I understand you are unhappy with behaviour you saw on
systemd systems; we can certainly improve behaviour of systemd in
userspace alone, i.e. abort the getrandom() after a while in userspace
and log about it using typical userspace logging to the console. I am
not sure why you want to do all that in the kernel, the kernel isn't
great at user interaction, and really shouldn't be.

If all you want is abort the getrandom() after 30s and a friendly
message on screen, by all means, let's add that to systemd, I have
zero problem with that. systemd has infrastructure for pushing that to
the user, the kernel doesn't really have that so nicely.

It appears to me you subscribe too much to an idea that userspace
people are not smart enough and couldn't implement something like
this. Turns out we can though, and there's no need to add logic that
appears to follow the logic of "never trust userspace"...

i.e. why not just consider this all just a feature request for the
systemd-random-seed.service, i.e. the service you saw the issue with
to handle this on its own?

As mentioned, in systemd's case, updating the random seed on disk
is entirely fine to take 5h or so. I don't really think we really need
to bound this in kernel space.
