yes i already did see the commit 461c1a7d4733. The change went in few 
years back now in gpiolib.

I wanted to point out that since gpiolib doesn't take lazy approch, the 
interrupt will

get disabled in HW the moment driver invokes disable_irq() from driver's 
suspend ops.

So during suspend someone need to re-enable in HW if its been marked for 
wakeup

This should happen probably at very late stage in suspend after all 
drivers are done.

See above reply, the someone mentioned above can be suspend_device_irq().

Since i don't see this as a problem for PDC irqchip alone but for every 
irqchip in kernel using GPIO

interrupts. Although i did not check how other platforms might be 
working, but i guess probably they don't

really disable at HW with disable_irq() or may not even have 
.irq_disable implemented in gpio irq_chip drivers.

No. if IRQ is maksed at GIC it doesn't wakeup even though at PDC its

Okay i will implement suspend/resume hook in PDC and use bitmap to

unmask at PDC and GIC during suspend. Addressed in V3.
