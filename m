In my case all valid CBs have TTBR0 and TTBR1 as 0, so I don't have a
page table. So all I need is a matching stream to keep the display
hardware satisfied.

Is this perhaps the thing that's mentioned as "S2CR bypass" mode?

The only way I can think of is if the bootloader would allocate these in
a chunk of memory which it removes from the memory ranges communicated
to the kernel.

In order to support this I believe we would need some logic that
remap the existing page tables and clone them into new ones, and then
update the CBs to match the existing configuration.

But as I said, this is beyond our current needs.

My expectation was that the reset value of these registers would have
some sane value, preferably without SMR_VALID being set.

There's nothing that prevents a system suspend before such drivers are

I didn't consider kexec, which I expect would also rule out the type of
DT properties that downstream uses to trigger some of this behavior (as
the same DT would be used by the launched system).

In the downstream DT targets a static reserved-memory region is used to
ensure Linux doesn't stomp on the actual framebuffer data and iirc the
ACPI firmware has the EFIFB memory region removed as well.

So I was expecting a translation of this particular region, but that's
not what we're seeing. But regardless, Linux needs to be aware of it
somehow, it's just that there's no link between the SMMU configuration
and this region as of today.


As a concrete example, booting a SDM845 based phone with this patch set
(and some debug prints) indicates that I have SMRs for primary and
secondary display pipe and then four entries for the various storage
devices.

While it's possible to alter the firmware for specific (and future)
devices, figuring out a way to do this in the kernel will be necessary
for the majority of existing devices. In many cases we can work around
this problem by configuring the bootloader to not do a splash screen but
with EFIFB on the laptops we do not have this ability (and that's why
these patches has not shown up until now).

I'm very much interested in us coming up with a sustainable, generic
solution that we can work with the firmware guys on implementing beyond
the current needs.


I will read up on the stream ids and EXIDs and make the read back of
SMRs conditioned on the qcom compatible.
