I have no strong oppinion about this. In v1, I replaced them with a 
WARN_ON(), and Aneesh suggested to go with VM_BUG_ON() instead.

My main purpose was to reduce the amount of BUG/BUG_ON and I thought 
those were good candidates, but if you prefer keeping the BUG(), that's 
ok for me. Or maybe you prefered v1 alternatives (series at 
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=98170) ?
