On branch users/mmetzger/fsgs in sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git,
there's a GDB test covering the behavior discussed theoretically back then.

It covers modifying the selector as well as the base from GDB and using
the modified values for inferior calls as well as for resuming the inferior.

Current kernels allow changing the selector and provide the resulting
base back to the ptracer.  They also allow changing the base as long as
the selector is zero.  That's the behavior we wanted to preserve IIRC.

The patch series on branch fsgs_tip_5.4-rc1_100319 at
github.com/changbae/Linux-kernel.git breaks tests that modify the
selector and expect that to change the base.

That kernel allows changing the base via ptrace but ignores changes
to the selector.

Markus.
