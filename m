It is reinitialized here like that, because if kfree_loops is < 4, then
mem_during needs to hold some value to avoid the (mem_begin - mem_during) to
falsely appear quite large. That's why I initialized it in the beginning. If
kfree_loops is >= 4, then yes it will be initialized twice but that's Ok.

I can add a comment to the earlier initialization if you like.

If that is the only comment on the patch left, I appreciate if you can
change:
 + long long mem_during = si_mem_available();
 to 
 + long long mem_during = si_mem_available(); // for kfree_loops < 4 case

Yes but diluting 200MB of delta by 16 is still high and causes a skew.

At the moment the results are showing me consistent numbers in my tests and
I'm quite happy with them. And it is better to have some measurement, than
not having anything.

We can certainly refine it further but at this time I am thinking of spending
my time reviewing Lai's patches and learning some other RCU things I need to
catch up on. If you hate this patch too much, we can also defer this patch
review for a bit and I can carry it in my tree for now as it is only a patch
to test code. But honestly, in its current form I am sort of happy with it.

The number I am aiming for is close to a constant. For example in a run, I
see the available memory goes down from 460000 pages to ~ 400000 pages. That
is around ~240MB of memory. This deviates by +- 20MB. I would rather take
many samples than just 1 sample and apply some form of reduction to combine
them into a single sample.  My current filtering works well in my testing and
I could do more complex things, but then again at the moment I am happy with
the test. I am open to any other filtering related suggestions though!

Sorry if I missed something!

thanks,
