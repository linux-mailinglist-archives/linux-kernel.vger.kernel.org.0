When I run "make htmldocs -j16" with a pre-1.7 sphinx, it is not
parallelized. When I run "make htmldocs -j8" with 1.7+ sphinx, it uses
all my CPUs instead of 8. :)

Ah, no problem. I can fix this. In a quick scan it looked like sphinx
was python3, but I see now that's just my install. :)

Whoops, thanks.

Fair enough. I will adjust this (and the later instance).

Good point. I will fix this too.

There is no method I have found to discover the -j option's contents
(intentionally so, it seems) from within make. :(
