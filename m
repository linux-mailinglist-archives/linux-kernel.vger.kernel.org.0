Yeah, if you look at dw_mci_runtime_suspend() you can actually see
that (at least in many cases) we actually disable the "BIU" clock.  I
believe this fully turns the clock off the controller and it can't
fire interrupts.

If I remember correctly the problem I actually saw before was that the
moment we turned the BIU back on in resume the SDIO interrupt fired.
:-P

I guess for now things will work OK so we can leave things as they
are.  If I see problems I can try masking all the interrupts at
suspend time, making sure that I don't mess up runtime suspend in
cases where we have a removable card using the builtin CD...

Thanks!
