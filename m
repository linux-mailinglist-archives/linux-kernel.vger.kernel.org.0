There isn't quite a commitment to not remove knobs, but if a tool
starts relying on a knob, then, the answer is yes there is :-p

As this will hopefully become something we don't worry about in the
future, I would rather have this be a kernel command line option. This
way, it wont be something that tools can really check for.

If you add a trace_console_latency option to the kernel command line,
we can enable it that way. And then when it becomes obsolete, we can
simply remove it, without breaking any tools.

Would that work for you?
