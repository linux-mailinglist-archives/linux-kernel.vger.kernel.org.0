Yes you are right. They are different codec drivers.
Sorry for the confusion. What I meant was that my use case on RK3288
was using dw-hdmi-audio.c codec driver,
which was later replaced by a more general version hdmi-codec.c.

Again you are right. Sorry for the confusion. What I meant is that
this callback mechanism should work on hdmi-codec.c driver as well.

I think extending current interface will work.
There is a struct hdmi_codec_pdata to let ALSA codec driver access
some ops through platform data.
And after this patch

https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/692324/

ALSA codec driver can get access to the struct on DRM side.
Based on this I can add a new ops to register callback function for jack status.
It will be similar to Doug's chromium patch above.
I think that is quite a feasible way, and can benefit all boards using
hdmi-codec.c.

Thanks a lot!!
