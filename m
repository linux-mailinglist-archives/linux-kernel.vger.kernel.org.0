Has the above patch set been posted for review? I'll take a look and see 
if that one can be used for queuing keys.

Will update the subject line.
I was trying to keep the subject line short and have more details in the 
patch description.

You are right - When custom ima policy rules are loaded (in 
ima_update_policy() function), ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement() 
function is called to process queued keys.

The flag ima_process_keys_for_measurement is set to true in 
ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement(). And, subsequent keys are 
processed immediately.

Please take a look at ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement() in this 
patch (v0 1/2) and the ima_update_policy() change in "PATCH v0 2/2".

The queued keys need to be processed once when the custom policy is 
loaded. Subsequently, keys are processed immediately (not queued).

Do you still think there is a need to have a function to determine if 
custom policy has been loaded? Wouldn't the flag 
ima_process_keys_for_measurement be sufficient?

Please take a look at "PATCH v0 2/2" and let me know if you disagree.

I'll remove this change.
