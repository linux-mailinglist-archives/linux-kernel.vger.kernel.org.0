You send this patch three times, I guess your mail setup has issues? :-)
 
This is one of the darkest corners of Fastmap where things get messy.
The number of retry attempts was limited to avoid a live lock.

I agree that allowing only one retry is a little to few.
With nandsim, a small nand and a fast PC you can hit that.

Do you have numbers how many attempts were needed to get a free block?

Thanks,
