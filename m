I was aware that there are some problem with this patch, but it is hard
to reproduce it. Do you have a more consistent way to reproduce it.
When=A0 you say under load, you mean that the host system is also busy so
that there are a lot of vcpu preemption. Right? Could you give me the
x86-64 .config file that you use?

Thanks,
