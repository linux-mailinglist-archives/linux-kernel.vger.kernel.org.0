Oh, too bad.  I had a vague memory that it did not call
driver_match_device().

This is a question for Greg.  The problem is that there may be drivers
which can't handle being probed for devices they don't match.

Still, we ought to have a mechanism for doing manual but not automatic 
matches.

Greg, any thoughts?

I prefer the manual/automatic approach.  It allows the user to control 
exactly which device will be probed, which could be important.
