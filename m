Right, I kept the original form but we can turn that into

  env->imbalance * 100 < busiest->group_weight * (env->sd->imbalance_pct - 100)



As for the base-2 imbalance; I think you've mentioned that in the past.
Looking at check_cpu_capacity() as a lambda imbalance_pct user, we could
turn that from:

  rq->cpu_capacity * sd->imbalance_pct < rq->cpu_capacity_orig * 100

to:

  rq->cpu_capacity_orig - rq->cpu_capacity < rq->cpu_capacity_orig >> sd->imbalance_shift


And here we could just go with

  env->imbalance < busiest->group_weight >> sd->imbalance_shift


As for picking values, right now we have

  125 (default) / 117 (LLC domain) / 110 (SMT domain)

We could have

  >> 2 (25%), >> 3 (12.5%), >> 4 (6.25%).

It's not strictly equivalent but IMO the whole imbalance_pct thing isn't
very precise anyway; just needs to be good enough on a sufficient number of
topologies.
