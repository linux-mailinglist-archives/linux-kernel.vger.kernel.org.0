Hi Steve,

Sorry, it took me some time to get a 32-bit x86 system up and running
here in order to build and test things on i386.  These patches pass
both selftests and the synth_event_gen_test testing, although the bug
where (null) prints after every integer field in the trace output is
still there and is there even before these or yesterday's patches - I
have a suspicion it's been there for awhile but nobody looked at
synthetic event trace output on i386.  In any case, I'm going to
continue looking into that - it's a weird situation where nothing gets
put in the final %s in the format string on i386 so shows as (null),
even though it looks like it's there.  Anyway..

Here are 3 bugfix patches, the first of which fixes the bug seen by
the test robot, and the other two are patches that fix a couple things
I noticed when doing the first patch.

The previous patch I sent, changing u64 to long for the test robot bug
did fix that problem too, but on i386 systems that would reduce every
field to 32 bits, which isn't what we want either.  The new patch
doesn't change the code in synth_event_trace() - it still uses u64
just like synth_event_trace_array() which takes an array of u64.
Without any further information such as a format string, I don't know
of a better way to deal with the varargs version, other than require
it get passed what it expects, u64 params.

The second patch adds the same endianness fix as for
trace_event_raw_event_synth(), and the last one just adds back a
missing check fot synth_event_trace() and synth_event_trace_array().

Thanks,

Tom
