Sure this can be moved to mm/ but unlike existing test configs there (following)
lets keep some config description in mm/Kconfig. Will probably rename this as
CONFIG_DEBUG_ARCH_PGTABLE_TEST to match other tests.

CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_TEST
CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA_TEST
CONFIG_MEMTEST

After moving to mm/ directory I guess it does not need a loadable module option.

Physical address corresponding to the symbol in the kernel text segment ?

So I guess this will help us use pte/pmd/pud/p4d/pgd entries from a real and
present mapping rather then making them up for test purpose. Although we are
not creating real page tables here just wondering if this could some how
affect these real mapping in anyway from some accessors. The current proposal
stays clear from anything real - allocates, evaluates and releases.

Also table entries at pmd/pud/p4d/pgd cannot be operated with accessors in the
test. THP and PUD THP will operate on leaf entries at pmd or pud levels. We need
them as leaf entries created from allocated (aligned) pfns. While determining
pte/pmd/pud/p4d/pgd for kernel_init() some of them will be table entries.

Sure those can be allocated and passed from the main function. Just wanted to
avoid page allocation in each individual tests.

That is another objective this test has which will help settle semantics
in a clear and documented manner.

IIUC THP at PUD is where the pud_t entries are directly operated upon and the
corresponding accessors are present only when HAVE_ARCH_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_PUD
is enabled. Am I missing something here ?
