Could we provide a detailed description of why this is considered to be
a problem?  This is fairly easily guessable, but is there a real
in-field bad user experience we can point at?

min_free_kbytes gets a few mentions in Documentation/.  Should we make
the appropriate updates there to bring this behavior to people's
attention?
