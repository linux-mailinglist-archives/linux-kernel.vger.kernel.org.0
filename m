Somewhere in this wall of text you need to say:
	MAKES DEVICES BOOT FASTER!
right?  :)

So in short, this solves the issue of deferred probing with systems with
loads of modules for platform devices and device tree, in that now you
have a chance to probe devices in the correct order saving loads of busy
loops.

A good thing, I like this, very nice work, all of these are:
	Reviewed-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>
but odds are I'll take this through my tree, so I'll add my s-o-b then.
But only after the DT people agree on the new entry.

thanks,
