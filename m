This sounds like at least something of a different issue, with similar
symptoms.

I don't think it is fundamentally wrong to pass the location of the dmi
tables in a command line option.  If you can build that command line
option independent of kexec and it takes practically no maintenance then
it does not harm, and can be used as a debug option by others.

My primary concern with your original patch is because it did not
apply to any version of the kernel in Linus's git tree that it had not
been tested on any code.



That said let me lay some background on kexec and efi so we can
have a productive conversation about how to maintain their cooperation
in the long term.  I am going to do this from memory so please forgive
me where I get my details slightly off.

EFI has two interesting calls for an operating system.

SetVirtualMap
ExitBootServices

The law of large numbers strongly suggests that when it comes to
emperical testing any interface that is not so heavily used it will fail
to boot all operating systems if it doesn't work will have at least one
broken implementation somewhere.  A bug so bad nothing can boot means
the hardware is unshippable and so will not be seen in the wild.  As
firmware is essentially fixed once a machine ships this means that all
firmware problems have to be dealt with by the boot loader and the
operating system.


SetVirtualMap by design can be called only once, which is problematic
when you are switching operating systems on a running system (kexec).
Last I was paying attention there were also systems discovered that
won't work if SetVirtualMap is not called at all.  I believe the
solution adopted for x86_64 was to always map EFI at the same location
in the page tables and only call SetVirtualMap the first time.


ExitBootSerives is similarly challenging as it can only be called once,
and there are systems that get it wrong if you call it at all.  Even if
ExitBootServices works you can't depend on any of the boot services for
the second kernel.



There are two primary uses for kexec.  To use the first kernel as a boot
loader in which case it is desiable for everything to work after kexec
is called.  To use the second kernel as something to capture a crash
dump in which case simply a best effor is needed and failing cleanly
if something won't work properly.


You are running interactive commands so I presume you are wanting to use
kexec as a bootloader.


I don't know where things are now but for a while was no desire to
address the concerns of people using kexec by the folks implementing EFI
or the folks implementing EFI support in the kernel.  But that is
probably how we got into a situation where efi support does not work
cleanly.

EFI choosing to place firwmare tables in somewhere besides their
architecturally defined location does not help.

I don't practically have a system with EFI so I have not personally
cared to fix any of the problems.


My sense is that for making EFI calls from any linux kernel should be
isolated in it's own page table, so isolate as much as possible any
EFI bugs from the rest of the kernel.  That is probably also needed to
provide a guard against speculative execution side channel attacks.



I can see doing some work to get EFI functional after kexec if it isn't
but at the same time I am not a fan of performing any unnecessary
firmware calls.  Someone sometime will implement one wrong, and it will
be a headache for everyone until it is removed.


By the same token I don't understand the problem with DMI not working.
As I recall all the linux kernel really uses DMI for is to decide which
quirks to apply.  It might be better just to pass a board name string
on the kernel command line, and use that string for quirk selection
instead.  A simple string seems like an easy to implement and use
debug command line option, that has uses outside of kexec.  AKA testing
to see if quirks do what you expect them too.


Which brings us to the question of quirks.  Why are quirks important?
If they are that suggests something else is wrong.  Maybe that something
else should be fixed.

Why do those boards need the DMI information in the first place?
