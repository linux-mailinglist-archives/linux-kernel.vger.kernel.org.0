Ya, it looks like we screwed this one up.  There's a bunch of differences 
between our image header format and the ARM64 one, and while we could evolve 
them in a compatible direction we would need to:

* Start setting our res3 to a RISC-V magic number, which would make it match 
  the magic number location for arm64.  We'd have to leave the 64-bit magic 
  number in for the previous two u-boot releases, but could in theory later 
  remove it when the Unleashed is defunct.
* Remove our version number, which u-boot isn't checking anyway but is 
  nominally reserved and set to 0 on ARM64.

If we do this now, we do at least get the option of making these compatible in 
the future.  I'm not sure it's worth the headache, as there's very little code 
here, but it's just embarrassing that we're incompatible for really no reason.
