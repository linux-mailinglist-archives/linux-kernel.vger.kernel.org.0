Note that +Matthias Kaehlcke commented on v1 your patch:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20191204220033.GH228856@google.com/

...so he should have been CCed on v2.  I would also note that some of
the comments below are echos of what Matthias already said in the
previous version but just weren't addressed.

Header files should be sorted alphabetically.  ...or, even better,
base your patch atop mine:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200124144154.v2.10.I1a4b93fb005791e29a9dcf288fc8bd459a555a59@changeid/

...which adds the gpucc header file so you don't have to.  ...and when
you do so, email out a Reviewed-by and/or Tested-by for my patch.  ;-)

Though it's not controversial, please send a patch to:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/msm/gmu.txt

...to add 'qcom,adreno-618.0', like:

    for example:
      "qcom,adreno-gmu-618.0", "qcom,adreno-gmu"
      "qcom,adreno-gmu-630.2", "qcom,adreno-gmu"

Probably as part of this you will be asked to convert this file to
yaml.  IMO we don't need to block landing this patch on the effort to
convert it to yaml, but you should still work on it.  ...or maybe
Jordan wants to work on it?

Running:

$ git grep gem_noc FETCH_HEAD
$ git fetch git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/qcom/linux.git
arm64-for-5.7-to-be-rebased
$ git grep gem_noc FETCH_HEAD

...shows no hits.  That's because the interconnect patches haven't
landed in the tree that you're targeting.  In the very least you
should mention somewhere in your email that your patch depends on the
interconnect patches landing, perhaps pointing at:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/1577782737-32068-4-git-send-email-okukatla@codeaurora.org

...but even better would be to split your patch into two parts.  The
first patch would be exactly like your patch except without the
"interconnects" line.  The 2nd patch would add the interconnects line.
This would allow Bjorn/Andy to land the first patch now and then land
the second patch when the interconnect series is ready.  I can confirm
that you can still get basic GPU functionality even without the
interconnects bit so it would be worth landing earlier.


I will also note that by basing on a tree that has private patches to
the same file you're touching you make it very hard for a maintainer
to apply.  When I try this:

$ curl https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/11352261/mbox/ | git am -3

I get:

error: sha1 information is lacking or useless
(arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sc7180.dtsi).
error: could not build fake ancestor
Patch failed at 0001 arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add A618 gpu dt blob

...yes, I can apply it with 'git am --show-current-patch | patch -p1'
but it's ugly (and it ends up making things sort in the wrong order).

Please send a patch to:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/arm,smmu.yaml

...adding 'qcom,sc7180-smmu-v2'.  If you do this it will point out
that you've added a new clock: "mem_iface_clk".  Is this truly a new
clock in sc7180 compared to previous IOMMUs?  ...or is it not really
needed?

nit: keep clocks and clock-names next to each other (no blank line).
If you really feel like it needs more space add it between the
clock-names and power-domains.

> +                       power-domains = <&gpucc CX_GDSC>;

Similar to interconnects, gpucc hasn't landed yet.  Somewhere you
should point out this fact and ideally point to:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200124144154.v2.10.I1a4b93fb005791e29a9dcf288fc8bd459a555a59@changeid/

...unlike interconnects, your patch can't land without gpucc, so you
should point this out as a hard dependency.

As per the bindings, "qcom,adreno-gmu-618" should be
"qcom,adreno-gmu-618.0", right?

...and I bet you'd never have guessed that I'll request that you add
"qcom,adreno-gmu-618" to:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/msm/gmu.txt

...and that you'll probably be asked to convert to yaml.  Again, maybe
Jordan wants to attempt this?

Bindings claim that you need both CX and GC.  Is sc7180 somehow
different?  Bindings also claim that you should be providing
power-domain-names.

Using the "thermal-zones" as context, it looks as if you're asserting
that your new nodes belong at the very end of the pile of nodes with
addresses.  This is not true.  Looking at the branch
'arm64-for-5.7-to-be-rebased' on the Qualcomm tree, I see:

cpufreq_hw: cpufreq@18323000

...which has a larger address than your 0x0506a000.  Please sort your
nodes numerically.
