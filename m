I named it i3cdev_priv_xfers in the patch I sent, but you can pick a
different name if you don't like this one.

Hm, I'm not sure that's a good idea. The set of ioctls for I2C and I3C
are likely to be completely different, so I'd recommend using a
separate namespace (AKA ioctl magic number). Wolfram, any opinion?

Indeed, looks like it's not documented.
