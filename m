Looks like it - only rq_pin_lock() clears RQCF_UPDATED, so any
update_rq_clock() that isn't preceded by that function will still have
RQCF_UPDATED set the second time it's executed and will trigger the warn.

Seeing as the wrappers boil down to raw_spin_*() when the debug bits are
disabled, I don't see why we wouldn't want to convert these callsites.
