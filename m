Yes, I wasn't explicitly considering that particular case, but it mostly 
falls out more or less the same way. Given that multi-device groups 
*should* be relatively rare, for the user override it seems reasonable 
to expect the user to see when devices get grouped and specify all of 
them to achieve the desired result; the trusted/untrusted attribute 
definitely shouldn't differ within any given group; and 
opportunistically replacing passthrough domains with translation domains 
for DMA-limited devices can only ever be a best-effort thing without 
consistent results, since at best that still comes down to which driver 
probed and called dma_set_mask() first.

Platform-specific exceptions like in device_def_domain_type() probably 
do want to stay in the individual drivers, but rolling that up into 
default domain allocation would be neat, and functionally no worse than 
the existing process.

In principle we could fairly easily delay allocating a group's default 
domain until the first driver bind event. It wouldn't help universally - 
in the absolute worst case, device B might only be created at all by 
device A's driver probing - and it might need careful coordination in 
areas like the bus->dma_configure() flow, but it could at least help 
accommodate the more common PCI case.
