We also have to deal with reading vmalloc'd data as that can fault too.
The perf ring buffer IIUC is vmalloc, so if perf records in one of
these locations, then the reading of the vmalloc area has a potential
to fault corrupting the CR2 register as well. Or have we changed
vmalloc to no longer fault?
