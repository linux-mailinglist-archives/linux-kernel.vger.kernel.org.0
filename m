You mean "one unique symbol from all other modules", right?

That is much different than just "one" symbol, given that almost
every driver depends on something else being enabled as well (bus type,
platform type, arch, etc.)

And I would argue, that finding that "one" symbol is easy, just parse
the Makefiles.  But I would also state that this "one" symbol doesn't
really help you much as those are the "simple" things.  It's how to
turn on all of the required symbols to get to that "one" symbol that is
the hard part.

And conversely, if you disable that "one" symbol, does that also mean
you can disable the symbols it depended on?  If so, how far back?

And what about functionality?  If my usb-storage device is "enabled" in
the build, yet all filesystems are not, or the needed dm module is not,
it is useless.  Hardware requires usually more than one real "symbol" in
order to work properly, as you know.

And of course, what does this really matter to anyone?  If you build
"all modules" and you only load the modules you actually use for your
hardware (based on auto-loading), then your system uses the same amount
of memory as if you disabled all of the modules you did not need.

Yes, it's faster to build, but is that what you are trying to optimize
for here?

Anyway, if this is just an acidemic thing, have fun, but I would not be
adding anything else to the module image that is not really going to be
useful to anyone.

good luck!
