While I understand what you are saying I do not think this is easily
achievable with the current implementation. The biggest problem I can
see is that you do not have a clear information who to charge for
the memory shortage on a particular NUMA node with a pure low limit
based balancing because the limit is not NUMA aware. Besides that the
origin of the memory pressure might be outside of any memcg.  You can
punish/account all memcgs in excess in some manner, e.g. proportionally
to their size/excess but I am not really sure how fair that will
be. Sounds like an interesting project but also sounds like tangent to
this patch.

High/Max limits are quite different because they are dealing with
the internal memory pressure and you can attribute it to the
cgroup/hierarchy which is in excess. There is a clear domain to reclaim
from. This is an easier model to reason about IMHO.

I beg to differ here. Ppu controller should be able to isolate user
contexts performing high limit reclaim now. Your patch is changing that
functionality to become unaccounted for a large part and that might be
seen as a regression for those workloads which partition the system by
using high limit and also rely on cpu controller because workloads are
CPU sensitive.

Without the CPU controller support this patch is not complete and I do
not see an absolute must to marge it ASAP because it is not a regression
fix or something we cannot live without.
