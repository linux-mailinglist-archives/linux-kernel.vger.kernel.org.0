One clue is that subj=kernel and auid, ttye and ses are unset, despite
the rest checking out:
	pid=1 uid=root auid=unset tty=(none) ses=unset subj=kernel comm=systemd exe=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd

I don't know what other config choices are going to make a difference
for pid=1 which is the primary user of this multicast socket other than
audit=1 unless we add another kernel boot parameter.

I'm puzzled why the production of this record doesn't automatically
trigger a syscall record on exit since that act of producing this record
will populate the audit context.

I don't have a problem with duplicate information, but I'm not the
consumer.  I can fix situations where that duplicate information turns
out to be inconsistent though.

I agree that is a different thread.
