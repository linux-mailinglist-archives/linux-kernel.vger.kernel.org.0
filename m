Actually, there are two users of pud_entry(), in hmm.c and since 5.5rc1 
also mapping_dirty_helpers.c. The latter one is unproblematic and 
requires no attention but the one in hmm.c is probably largely untested, 
and seems to assume it was called outside of the spinlock.

The problem with the current patch is that the hmm pud_entry will 
traverse also pmds, so that will be done twice now.

In another thread we were discussing a means of rerunning the level (in 
case of a race), or continuing after a level, based on the return value 
after the callback. The change was fairly invasive,
