Ok. My primary concern around this is that it's very difficult to use
correctly in anything other than the "all" or "none" modes. If a new
kernel feature is added with integrated lockdown support, if an admin
is simply setting the flags of things they wish to block then this
will be left enabled - and may violate the admin's expectations around
integrity. On the other hand, if an admin is simply setting the flags
of things they wish to permit, then adding lockdown support to an
existing kernel feature may result in that feature suddenly being
disabled, which may also violate the admin's expectations around the
flags providing a stable set of behaviour.

Given that, would you prefer such a policy expression to look like?

Ok, that makes sense. If we take this approach, does there need to be
a separate policy mechanism at all? Users who want fine-grained
control would be able to set the behaviour to "None" and then use
their choice of LSM to express more fine-grained control.

I can start on this.
