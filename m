The patch

   ASoC: fix card registration regression.

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: fix card registration regression.

This reverts commit b2354e4009a773c00054b964d937e1b81cb92078.

This change might have been desirable to ensure the uniqueness of
the component name. It would have helped to better support linux
devices which register multiple components, something is which more
common than initially thought.

However, some card driver are directly using dev_name() to fill the
component names of the dai_link which is a problem if want to change
the way ASoC generates the component names.

Until we figure out the appropriate way to deal with this, revert the
change and keep the names as they were. There might be a couple of warning
related to debugfs (which were already present before the change) but it
is still better than breaking working audio cards.
