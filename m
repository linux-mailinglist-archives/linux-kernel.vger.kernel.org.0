:)

Ah, but I was thinking of actual memory *used*, not just VA.

And of KASAN, not user-space, but yeah, good point.

Indeed.

Right, I guess that's the broader point. I was thinking mostly of the
memory consumption: if you run with UML KASAN, your UML virtual machine
will use around 12.5% more memory than before, unlike if you say have a
KVM virtual machine - whatever you reserve outside will be what it can
use inside, regardless of KASAN being enabled or not.

This is totally fine, I just thought it should be documented somewhere,
perhaps in the Kconfig option, though I guess there isn't a UML specific
one for this... Not sure where then.
