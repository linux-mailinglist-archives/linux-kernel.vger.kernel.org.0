Basically this is final pll set rate when sun4i_dotclock.c called the
desired rate with ccu_nkm.c so it ended the final rate with parent as

Sorry, I can argue much other-than giving some code snips, according to [1]

00) Line 785, 786 with dclk_rate 148000000

lcd_rate = dclk_rate * clk_info.dsi_div;
pll_rate = lcd_rate * clk_info.lcd_div;

Since dsi_div is 6 (bpp/lanes), lcd_div 1

lcd_rate = 888000000, pll_rate = 888000000

01)  Line 801, 804 are final rates computed as per clock driver (say
ccu_nkm in mainline)

lcd_rate_set=891000000

As per your comments if it would be 4 then the desired numbers are
would be 592000000 not 888000000.

This is what I'm trying to say in all mails, and same as verified with
2-lanes devices as well where the dsi_div is 12 so the final rate is
290MHz * 12

Don't understand what proves are remaining, I have explained each line
from BSP and saying pll rate is depends on dsi_div which is bpp/lanes
not wrt tcon_div on BSP (which is set to default 4) and which indeed
verified in A33, R40. all the code using bpp/lanes.

Please let me know if you need any more information to look?
