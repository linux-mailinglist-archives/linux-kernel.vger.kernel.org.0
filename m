After re-reading the code, I am not sure we can easily detect the
clones. So at some point, I think we will break them, but there is not
much we can do. I don't really have a solution for that :(

OK, I played with that idea earlier this week:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/hid-tools/merge_requests/74
I only have a Sixaxis controller, and I only implemented the USB part
of it (AFAICT).
Currently this ensures the button mapping is correct, and that the
LEDs are working properly.
We are still missing a few bits and pieces, but the initialization
(requests made by the kernel to start the device and press on the PS
button) is handled properly.

If this is something Roderick would be interested in, we can then try
to extend this initial work on Bluetooth controllers and the DualShock
ones.
Adding the clones ones based on the current kernel code is something
doable, but I do not expect Sony to be involved in that process.

That being said, before we merge this particular patch about Gasia
controllers, now we need to implement a regression test first :)

Cheers,
Benjamin
