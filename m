Yes, this is impressive. But does it matter in the grand scheme of
things? How much time does this system take to arrive at this point
from power on?

I agree that this optimization looks good in isolation, but the fact
that you spotted a bug justifies my skepticism at the time. On the
other hand, now that we have several independent reports (from you,
but also from the Renesas folks) that the speedup is worthwhile for
real world use cases, I think it does make sense to revisit it.

So what I would like to see is the patch set being proposed again,
with the new data points added for documentation. Also, the commit
logs need to crystal clear about how the meaning of PFN validity
differs between ARM and other architectures, and why the assumptions
that the optimization is based on are guaranteed to hold.
