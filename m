You could change just a single symbol name though :)

Just trying to think how best to express that.

[ Aside, the whole symbol name resolution linking stuff does matching on=20
  on any number of ~arbitrary strings that you can generate as you like,=20
  and symbol tables are something that all existing tools and libs=20
  understand.

  So I strongly favour using that as the back end for our "version"
  resolution system _if at all possible_ rather than adding these extra
  bits of crud that really just do the same thing. At least for a first
  pass, I don't want to over-engineer things.

  Then it hopefully becomes a matter of adding some helper macros and
  build facilities on top of that which can contain everyone's
  requirements mostly within .config and perhaps a very small patch.
  A bit more work with preprocessor macros etc is far preferable to
  linking and loading "features" IMO]

Back to your case, is it sufficient to have just an internal and an
external module version where the kernel provides both and your in-tree
modules match on the internal, others match on external?

Thanks,
Nick
