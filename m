So basically the issues is that callers may expect that the return size
is still in the buffer and they append a '\0' to it. This is the same
issue with strncpy() and will cause the same kinds of bugs.

I agree too. We either keep it as is and let the callers be able to add
the '\0', or we preferably add the '\0' ourselves and return the length
written (not counting the terminating '\0'), and we can then remove the
callers adding the '\0' later.

That's the safest approach.
