As I was doing this, I noticed that the self-tests all use hard-coded struct
sizes. When I was playing with extending the API, all of a sudden all the
self-tests started failing (until I recompiled them against newer headers).

Should we also change the self-tests to operate against the seccomp
sizes API, or was it intentional for the self-tests hard-coded the struct
definitions, and locked to the kernel version?
