By "pass an invalid CPU" I don't mean offline; I mean >= nr_cpu_ids which is
what cpumask_any_and() returns if the sets don't intersect (a CPU going
offline is merely a way to end up in that situation).  At one point I
observed that causing a crash.  I guess is_cpu_allowed() returned true by
chance based on the contents of data beyond the end of the cpumask?  That
doesn't seem likely based on what comes after p->cpus_mask (at that point
migrate_disable should be zero), but maybe I had something else at that
point in the struct while developing.  In any case, not something to be
relied on. :-)

Going offline after selection shouldn't be a problem.  migration_cpu_stop()
won't do anything if is_cpu_allowed() returns false, and we'll get migrated
off the CPU by migrate_tasks().  Even if we get migrated after reading
task_cpu(p) but before queuing the stop machine work, it'll either get
flushed when the stopper thread parks, or rejected due to stopper->enabled
being false.
