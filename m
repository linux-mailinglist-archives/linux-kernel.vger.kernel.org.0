Maybe I should add some background info here as well. Currently, I am
creating an -rt tree on v5.3 for which I need this patch (or a
migrate_disable() version of it). So this is slightly independent of
the work Sebiastian is doing. Though the mainline effort of PREEMPT_RT
will hit this problem as well.

I understood Sebiastian wrong above. I thought he suggest to use the
migrate_disable() approach even for mainline. 

I supppose, one thing which would help in this discussion, is what do
you gain by using preempt_disable() instead of moving the lock up?
Do you have performance numbers which could justify the code?
