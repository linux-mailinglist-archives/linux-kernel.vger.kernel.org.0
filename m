It really does help reviewing patches when this is mentioned in the
commit message.

There is some debate about whether this should be mentioned as a Fixes
since it doesn't fix a bug.  I initialy felt it shouldn't be, but now
I think enough people think it should be listed as Fixes that I must be
wrong.  Either way, it's very useful information.

The other thing is that soon get_maintainer.pl will start CC'ing people
from the Fixes tag and right now Lowry Li is not CC'd so that's
unfortunate.
