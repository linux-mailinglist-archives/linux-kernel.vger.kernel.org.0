The amount of work wouldn't seem to matter as long as the kernel thread stays
in the cgroup and lives long enough.  There's only the one-time cost of
attaching it when it's forked.  That seems doable for unbound workqueues (the
async reclaim), but may not be for the network packets.

The membership and context issues are pretty compelling though.  Good to know,
I'll keep it in mind as I think this through.

Yes, having both would appear to be redundant.

Ok, thanks.
