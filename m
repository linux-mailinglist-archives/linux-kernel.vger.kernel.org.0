Hmm, and afaict, even if the compiler was modified to emit LDREX instructions
for volatile loads, it wouldn't help in this case because test_bit() isn't
using READ_ONCE().

It's also slightly odd that the proposed patch makes the code look like:

	for (i = 0; i < b; i++) {
		if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
			__wait_on_buffer(bh);
			smp_rmb();
		}
		if (!buffer_uptodate(bh[i]))
			goto block_release;
	}

whereas there are other potential RAR orderings between buffer_locked()
and __wait_on_buffer() and also probably between successive iterations
of the loop.

So, really, the only way I see to solve this is for us to use READ_ONCE
consistently for all relaxed atomic loads (KCSAN is starting to tread on
this), and then to patch READ_ONCE to emit a DMB at runtime for arch/arm/
(maybe a static key would work if you can avoid the recursion).

I've already got patches at [1] to allow architectures to override
READ_ONCE, because Alpha needs to do something similar.
