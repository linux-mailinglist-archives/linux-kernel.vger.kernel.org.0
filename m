It's not an objtool bug.  It's a byproduct of the fact that GCC's
undefined behavior is inscrutable, and there's no way to determine that
it actually *wants* to jump to a random function.

And anyway, regardless of objtool, the patch is meant to make the code
more robust.

Do you not agree that BUG (defined behavior) is more robust than
unreachable (undefined behavior)?
