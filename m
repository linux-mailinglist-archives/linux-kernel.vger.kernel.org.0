I think this is the right thing to do. The only requirement we have
_before_ enter_from_user_mode() is to tell lockdep that interrupts are
off. There is not even the need for a real tracepoint IMO. The fact that
the lockdep call is hidden in that tracepoint is just an implementation
detail.

That would clearly set the rules straight: Anything low level entry code
before enter_from_user_mode() returns is neither probable nor
traceable.

I know that some people will argue that this is too restrictive in terms
of instrumentation, but OTOH the whole low level entry code has to be
excluded from instrumentation anyway, so having a dozen instructions
more excluded does not matter at all. Keep it simple!

That surely would be useful.
