Just get rid of the "google,rk3399evb-rev2" from the .dts please :-) .

(1)  "rockchip,rk3399-evb", "rockchip,rk3399", "google,rk3399evb-rev2";
    is just wrong for the reasons Robin explained, I guess that slipped
    through review at the time.
(2) "google,rk3399evb-rev2" was a specific variant for Google I'm pretty
    sure they'll have scraped all these boards directly after they had the
    first actual rk3399-gru development devices

So I'm pretty sure the only rk3399-evbs in existence are the general ones.
