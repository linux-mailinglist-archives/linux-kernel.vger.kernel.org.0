is this the correct SHA from mainline?  I assume you meant
commit b059f801a937 ("x86/purgatory: Use CFLAGS_REMOVE rather than
reset KBUILD_CFLAGS")

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/7/26/198 was the list.  The "ratpoutine"
flags were added in the final version of the patch that landed.  It's
not immediately clear to me which of those 4 changed flags would
result in the error that you're observing, but if you could test them
quickly to see which restores working behavior, we could triple check
it on our end and submit it.
