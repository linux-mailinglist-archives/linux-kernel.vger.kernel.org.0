Once driver has GUP it does not check and re-check the struct page
so there is no synchronization whatsoever after GUP happened. In
fact for some driver you can not synchronize anything once the device
has been program. Many devices are not just simple DMA engine you
can start and stop at will (network, GPUs, ...).

So once a page is GUP there is just noway to garanty its stability
hence the best thing we can do is snapshot it to a bounce page.
