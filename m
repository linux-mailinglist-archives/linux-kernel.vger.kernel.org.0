Agree.  To be honest, I considered to use your suggested way, but I
worried about the boundary conditions for 'offset', so went back to
use explict method with two code segments (head and sequential samples).

After review the suggested code, I don't find any issue.  Will refine
code as this way and give testing for it.

Very appreciate the suggestions :)
