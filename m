I remember thinking about this large alignment, as it looked out of
place to me also.
It was there to keep memmap in single chunks on larger x86 machines.
Perhaps it can be revisited now.

The patch that introduced this alignment:
9bdac914240759457175ac0d6529a37d2820bc4d

vmemmap_alloc_block_buf
+       ptr = (void *)ALIGN((unsigned long)vmemmap_buf, size);
