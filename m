Well, its not a missing case as such.
Let me explain.
Whenever rpmh_invalidate()  (lets call it event a) is called, controller 
dirty flag is set.
post invalidating, the aggregator driver always sends new sleep data 
(event b) and wake data (event c).
the last cpu going down flushes the cached data and dirty flag is 
unset.  (event d)

hence setting dirty flag, only once during (event a) and not updating it 
during (event b, c) was not any issue/missing case, at least till now.

However with changes to invoke rpmh_flush() whenever data is dirty, it 
is required to set this flag for each of these events.
Otherwise as the rpmh_flush() call happened during event b would have 
marked as non-dirty data at the end of it,
now when rpmh_flush() call happened during event c, it will not flush 
anything as caches are not dirty, which is not the expectation.

sure i can add details on why we need to update dirty flag everytime 
when touching caches.
