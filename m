The root cause is that multiple submission vs. single completion.

Let's see two cases:

1) 10 NVMe, each 8 queues, 80 CPU cores
- suppose genriq matrix can avoid effective cpu overlap, each cpu
  only handles one nvme interrupt
- there can be concurrent submissions from 10 CPUs, and all may be
  completed on one CPU
- IRQ flood couldn't happen for this case, given each CPU is only
  handling completion from one NVMe drive, which shouldn't be fast
  than CPU.

2) 10 NVMe, each 32 queues, 80 CPU cores
- one CPU may handle 4 NVMe interrupts, each from different NVMe drive
- then there may be 4*3 submissions aimed at single completion, then IRQ
  flood should be easy triggered on CPU for handing 4 NVMe interrupts.
  Because IO from 4 NVMe drive may be quicker than one CPU.

I can observe IRQ flood on the case #1, but there are still CPUs for
handling 2 NVMe interrupt, as the reason mentioned by Long. We could
improve for this case.

Thanks,
Ming
