Good point. I suppose we need to find a lazy way of doing
this, too...

The GENTLE_FAIR_SLEEPERS code should place the vruntime
of newly unthrottled tasks to the right of that of the
current top task on the runqueue, to prevent thundering
herd effects (and the throttled group immediately going
over its quota again, while causing bad latency for others).
