Independent of the point above (partly a least), I wonder what will
happen in some particular use cases

* If clock is changed while in suspend. This clock can be a parent of
  the clock invalidated but currently is not. What happen, if later,
  it becomes the parent ?

  Since it is not parent on resume it won't be invalidated. CCF might
  still take a decision based on an invalid cached value.

* If a mux is changed while in suspend, the parent is not correct
  anymore. The proposed patch recurse through the parents, it might
  not invalidate what we need/expect ... things are getting a bit
  unpredictable

IOW, this change take a leaf clock and tries to tell CCF that any parent
of this clock should not be trusted, but it might get it wrong in some
cases.

I think we should do it in the opposite way:
 * Mark the "rogue" clock with a flag (CLK_REFRESH ?)
 * Let CCF update the children of these clocks based on the new status

Back to Stephen point, I don't know which API it should be, but I
think the platform (fw driver or power stuff - not only clock provider)
should be able somehow to trigger the mechanism to let CCF know
something sketchy may have happened.

For the parameter, maybe there should not be any (no struct clk or
clk_hw) ? Maybe it would better if we let CCF refresh all the "rogue"
clocks ?
