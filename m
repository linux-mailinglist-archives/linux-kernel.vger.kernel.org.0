Well, if there are any gadget drivers in the kernel which do set an
endpoint's maxpacket size to 0, they should be fixed.  I'm not aware of
any.

Of course, gadget drivers in userspace are always suspect.  That's why
I suggested having gadgetfs and configfs perform this check.  Even so
it's not really a _security_ risk, because only the superuser is
allowed to run a userspace gadget driver.  (Although obviously it is 
better to have a clean failure than to crash the system when a buggy 
program runs with superuser privileges.)

Yes, HCDs do depend on endpoints having reasonable maxpacket values.  I 
suppose the core should check for this.  Currently we check for values 
that are too large or invalid in other ways (like high-speed bulk 
endpoints with maxpacket != 512), but we don't check for 0.

In fact, that sounds like a much better solution to the problem
overall.  Let's see if this patch fixes the bug...
