Good question. These kind of problems should be solved in linux-next
git tree.

Well, I am not sure how often you see these false positives. I think
that they happen only where there is some global change that affects
many subsystems and is done in more stages.

In this case, we removed most pr_warning() users in one patchset. Then
we removed the remaining (new) users and the function definition
in another patchset. It might be a corner case that does not need
any changes on your side.

Best Regards,
Petr
