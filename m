With a bit of care, we can reliably set the rtc to the system time from
userspace. It takes a bit of time (up to 2 seconds) but it can be
reliably set with an accuracy of a few ms on a slow system and an rtc on
a slow bus or a few ns with a fast system and a fast bus.
I know I did say I would implement it in hwclock and I still didn't
(sorry) but we could do better than the --delay option.

We could but from a distro point of view, would that be convenient?
