This looks good to me, with the one minor problem below that you can fix
with a follow-on patch.  This should probably go through Felipe's tree
though, so I'll wait for him to review the gadget side and then queue it
up in his tree:

You have to manually specify the enum values in the .h file for all
entries in order to assure that both userspace and the kernel will be in
sync with the same values.  I think that's documented in the "how to
write an ioctl interface" document that is somewhere in
Documentation/...
