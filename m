Can you please share the changes you've made to sdm845.dtsi and a kernel
base on top of which to apply your patches? I would like to reproduce
your results and run more tests and it would be good if our setups were
as close as possible.

Do you happen to know by how much the CPUs were capped during these
experiments?

Thanks,
Ionela.
