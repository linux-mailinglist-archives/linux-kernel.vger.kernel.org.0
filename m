There is another way in which boot memory can be created as ZONE_MOVABLE
irrespective of whether the firmware (ACPI/OF) had asked for it or not.
This is achieved with "kernelcore" or "movablecore" kernel command line
options where the administrator exclusively asks for sections of memory
to be converted as ZONE_MOVABLE. This creates some of the memory block
devices in /sys/devices/system/memory as removable (ZONE_MOVABLE). IIUC
this is mutually exclusive with respect to removable boot memory creation
with "movable_node" kernel command line option with firmware tagged hot
pluggable memory sections (ACPI_SRAT_MEM_HOT_PLUGGABLE).

Details here: mm/page_alloc.c find_zone_movable_pfns_for_nodes()

Now, this boils down to the fact whether firmware will ever request for
removal of boot memory sections which was never tagged as hotpluggable
by the firmware during boot. Wondering if tagging portions of boot memory
as ZONE_MOVABLE might have any other use case if they are never to be hot
removed. Will continue looking into ACPI/OF memory hotplug scenarios.
