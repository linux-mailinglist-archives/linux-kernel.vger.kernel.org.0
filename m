Yes I typically tend towards using a "namespace_object_operation" naming 
scheme, with "as_dirty" being the namespace here,

But I'll give it a shot to see if I can rename it more in line with the 
above.

Looking at Matthew's suggestion but lining up with 
"unmap_mapping_range()", perhaps we could use "clean_mapping_range" and 
"wp_mapping_range"?

Thanks,

Thomas
