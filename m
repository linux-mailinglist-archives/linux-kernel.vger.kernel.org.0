Short answer, BIOS controls SGX_LE_WR.

The approach we chose (patch 04, which we were discussing) is to disable
SGX if SGX_LE_WR is not set, i.e. disallow SGX unless the hash MSRs exist
and are fully writable.

WRMSR will #GP if FEATURE_CONTROL is locked (bit 0), e.g. attempting to
set SGX_LE_WR will trap if FEATURE_CONTROL was locked by BIOS.  And
conversely, the various enable bits in FEATURE_CONTROL don't take effect
until FEATURE_CONTROL is locked, e.g. the LE hash MSRs aren't writable if
FEATURE_CONTROL is unlocked, regardless of whether SGX_LE_WR is set.

Sadly, because FEATURE_CONTROL must be locked to fully enable SGX, the
reality is that any BIOS that supports SGX will lock FEATURE_CONTROL.

That's the status quo today as well since VMX (and SMX/TXT) is also
enabled via FEATURE_CONTROL.  KVM does have logic to enable VMX and lock
FEATURE_CONTROL if the MSR isn't locked, but AIUI that exists only to work
with old BIOSes.

If we want to support setting and locking FEATURE_CONTROL in the extremely
unlikely scenario that BIOS left it unlocked, the proper change would be
to move the existing KVM FEATURE_CONTROL logic into the early-ish boot
flow and try to set all known bits before locking FEATURE_CONTROL.  I
don't have a strong preference either way.  We opted not to try and set
FEATURE_CONTROL as we felt that doing so was more likely to cause breakage
than it was to actually "fix" a broken BIOS.

One note on Launch Control that isn't covered in the SDM: the LE hash
MSRs can also be written before SGX is activated.  SGX activation must
occur before FEATURE_CONTROL is locked, meaning BIOS can set the LE
hash MSRs to a non-intel and then lock FEATURE_CONTROL with SGX_LE_WR=0.

There's a blurb on SGX activation in the kernel docs (patch 23).

Heh, why stop at 4?  12_EBX, 12_1_ECX and 12_1_EDX are effectively feature
leafs as well, although the kernel can ignore them for the most part.
