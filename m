Yea, I worry about this as well, as I know there is also the lt9611
bridge chip driver pending for the db845c which works against the
current msm dsi code. So changing the msm driver for the adv7533 may
break other drivers (in the case of lt9611, out of tree - so wouldn't
be a regression, but there may be others) written against the current
expectations.

A temporary clearly-marked-deprecated config option might also a
reasonable approach while we transition drivers over?

Matt: I'm happy to help you test and validate things. Let me know how
I can help!
