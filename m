Right, some backtrace is definitely often useful for understanding where
things broke and helping people search for problems - it's just
providing the *full* backtrace that can be an issue as a lot of it can
end up being redundant.  As a rule of thumb I'd tend to say that once
you get out of the driver or subsystem you're starting to loose
relevance.  For example with a probe failure like this once you get out
of the driver probe function it almost never matters exactly what the
stack in the device model core is, it's not adding anything and it's
usually more than a screenful that needs to be paged through.  Cutting
that out helps people focus on the bits that matter.

Any analysis you've done about why things got confused and broken is
definitely good to include!
