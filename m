But the OS controls speculative access to physical addresses by their
presence or absence in the page tables.  Speculation is done with
calculations based on virtual addresses, without a valid translation
to physical addresses it doesn't progress to an externally visible
action.

This is their intent in marking it as reserved in the memory tables.
They have explored many other avenues (I've even suggested a couple
since pinning down this problem) and for each one there is a reason it
doesn't work.

My current wording for a comment to go above the code is:

/*
 * Only the region occupied by the kernel has so far been checked against
 * the table of usable memory regions provided by the firmware, so
 * invalidate pages outside that region.  A page table entry that maps to
 * a reserved area of memory would allow processor speculation into that
 * area, and on some hardware (particularly the UV platform) speculation
 * into reserved areas can cause a system halt.
 */

How close does that come to working for you?  (I'm going to dive
specifically into the phrase "region occupied by the kernel" in a
reply to Dave in another message; I understand that phrase may need
work.  I'm more asking about the remainder of it here.)
