But SATA is not a memory-mapped bus - in the context of MMIO, the AHCI 
is the bus-master device, not a bridge or level of interconnect. The 
DeviceTree spec[1] clearly defines dma-ranges as an address translation 
between a "parent bus" and a "child bus".

If in the worst case this address-limited interconnect really only 
exists between the AHCI's master interface and everything else in the 
system, then you'll have to describe it explicitly to meet DT's 
expectation of a "bus" (e.g. [2]). Yes, it's a bit clunky, but any 
scheme has its edge cases.

Disregarding that this was apparently never in ePAPR, so not 
grandfathered in to DTSpec, and effectively nobody ever has actually 
followed it (oh, if only...), note "<empty>" - that still doesn't imply 
that a *non-empty* dma-ranges would be valid on device nodes.
