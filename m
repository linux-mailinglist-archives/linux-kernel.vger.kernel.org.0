Hi Dietmar,

Like I said, don't want to argue on name. It is trivial for me. I have
v10 prepped with the name change. Will send it out shortly.

I agree that there is no need for per-cpu thermal pressure to be
maintained if no averaging is happening in the scheduler, today. I don't
know if there will ever be an use for it.
My issue has to do with using a config option meant for internal
scheduler code being used else where. To me, once this happens, the
entire work done to separate out reading and writing of instantaneous
thermal pressure to arch_topology makes no sense. We could have kept it
in scheduler itself.
Another way I think about this whole thermal pressure framework  is that
it is the job of cooling device or cpufreq or any other entity to update
a throttle in maximum pressure to the scheduler. It should be
independent of what scheduler does with it. Scheduler can choose to
ignore it.
