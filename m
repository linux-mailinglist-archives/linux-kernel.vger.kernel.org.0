I have not tested modules - you might want to test modules before
sending it at a proper patch. I just know that it works for the
purposes of this KASAN project.

Currently, the amount of shadow memory allocated is a constant based
on the amount of user space address space in x86_64 since this is the
host architecture I have focused on.

Yes, I have not found a fix for these issues yet and even with these
few files excluded from instrumentation, the syscall_stub_data error
occurs(unless CONFIG_STACK is disabled, but CONFIG_STACK is enabled by
default when using gcc to compile). It is unclear whether this is a
bug that KASAN has found in UML or it is a mismatch of KASAN error
detection on UML.

I did base this on your patch. I figured it was more likely to get
merged before this patch anyway. To clarify, do you want me to include
your constructors patch with this one as a patchset?

Probably not, but with this executing before main(), what is the best
way to have an error occur? Or maybe there's a way we can just
continue without KASAN enabled and print to the console that KASAN
failed to initialize?
