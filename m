There is nothing in the SoundWire specification that tells how a 
controller/master should interface with the rest of the SoC.

There are two ways of handling wake-ups
a. 'normal' wakes handled internally by the master - that's what the 
regular clock stop does.
b. PCI-based wakes. In that case, the wake is not detected at the 
SoundWire level - the IP is power-gated -, but comes from the PCI 
subsystem based on a level detector and needs to be notified to the 
SoundWire master. That's what I did.

Now you can claim that this case b) doesn't belong in the 
drivers/soundwire code, in which case my answer will be to move all the 
Intel controller code in sound/soc/sof/intel. I have no choice but to 
implement what's needed on the hardware I have.

I will respectfully ask that you have a conversation with Greg on this 
one. These patches were reviewed as 'sane', I am not going to go back on 
this without an agreement on directions.

I followed Greg's guidance. There was nothing in the thread with Greg 
that hinted as a required change.
If you don't agree with Greg, please talk with him.

Yes indeed, and we just circled once more.

Talk with Greg please.

They are not required, don't use them if you don't need them?
What's wrong with this approach?

Again talk with Greg.

for the matching needed to find a driver.

no, this function returns a pointer.

that's exactly what we do, we store the value on pm_runtime_suspended() 
and use it on resume.

Huh, that's pretty much self-explanatory? device_add() adds a device and 
if there's a driver for it the probe will be called. Nothing fancy or 
earth-shattering.

isn't it more clear when the prototypes come with the documentation, 
rather than the kernel doc stuff be buried in pages of code?
