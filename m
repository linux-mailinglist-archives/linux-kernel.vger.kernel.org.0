I see. With the following rt-app file on h960 (8 CPUs) I'm able to
recreate the situation relatively frequently.

...
"tasks" : {
 "thread0" : {
  "instance" : 12,
  "run" : 11950,
  "timer" : { "ref" : "unique", "period" : 100000, "mode" : "absolute"},
  "dl-runtime" : 12000,
  "dl-period" : 100000,
  "dl-deadline" : 100000
 }
}

...
[ 1912.086664] CPU1: p=[thread0-9 3070] throttled p->on_rq=0 flags=0x9
[ 1912.086726] CPU2: p=[thread0-10 3071] throttled p->on_rq=0 flags=0x9
[ 1924.738912] CPU6: p=[thread0-10 3149] throttled p->on_rq=0 flags=0x9
...

And the flag DEQUEUE_SLEEP is set so like you said
task_non_contending(p) should be called.

I'm going to use your proposal. Thank you for the help!
