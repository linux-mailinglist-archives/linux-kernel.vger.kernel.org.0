Subject: [RFC PATCH] docs: filesystems: convert autofs.txt to reST
Message-ID: <20191113073822.GA31926@localhost.localdomain>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline

Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch converts autofs.txt to reST.

 - Most of the changes pertain to reST formatting.
 - Some of the code snippets are updated to reflect current source.
 - A definition of the autofs packet header has been added in the chapter
	"Communicating with autofs: the event pipe".
 - An indentation of an 8 space tab has been added wherever suitable, so
   as to maintain consistency.
 - Removed indentation of the description of the ioctls which are similar
   to the AUTOFS_IOC ioctls, as it does not come out quite right in HTML.
