This hack can be easily extended to handle systems with arbitrary start
address, but it's still a hack...

I was actually looking how to replace NOMAP with something else to make
memblock.memory consistent with actual physical memory banks. But this work
is stashed for now.

I'm not sure that skipping NOMAP regions would be good enough.
If I understand corrrectly, with Chester's original patch the reservation
of PMD aligned chunk of 32M for the kernel made the first conv-mem region
PMD aligned and then memblock_limit will be set to the end of this region.

Is there a reason for marking EFI_RESERVED_TYPE as NOMAP rather than simply
reserve them with memblock_reserve()?
