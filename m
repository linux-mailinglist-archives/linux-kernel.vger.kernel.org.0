The most significant issue I see is the following.  Consider two
cases. First, an SGX2 enclave that dynamically allocates memory but
doesn't execute code from dynamic memory.  Second, an SGX2 enclave
that *does* execute code from dynamic memory.  In #1, the untrusted
stack needs to decide whether to ALLOW_EXEC when the memory is
allocated, which means that it either needs to assume the worst or it
needs to know at allocation time whether the enclave ever intends to
change the permission to X.

I suppose there's a middle ground.  The driver could use model #1 for
driver-filled pages and model #2 for dynamic pages.  I haven't tried
to fully work it out, but I think there would be the ALLOW_READ /
ALLOW_WRITE / ALLOW_EXEC flag for EADD-ed pages but, for EAUG-ed
pages, there would be a different policy.  This might be as simple as
internally having four flags instead of three:

ALLOW_READ, ALLOW_WRITE, ALLOW_EXEC: as before

ALLOW_EXEC_COND: set implicitly by the driver for EAUG.

As in #1, if you try to mmap or protect a page with neither ALLOW_EXEC
variant, it fails (-EACCES, perhaps).  But, if you try to mmap or
mprotect an ALLOW_EXEC_COND page with PROT_EXEC, you ask LSM for
permission.  There is no fancy DIRTY tracking here, since it's
reasonable to just act as though *every* ALLOW_EXEC_COND page is
dirty.  There is no real auditing issue here, since LSM can just log
what permission is missing.

Does this seem sensible?  It might give us the best of #1 and #2.

I'm not sure this makes a difference.  It simplifies SIGSTRUCT
handling, which is handy.
