Your NACKs on trace patches over the years have spoken out loud about this

True. However, for kprobes-based BPF program - it does check for kernel
version to ensure that the BPF program is built against the right kernel
version (in order to ensure the program is built against the right set of
kernel headers). If it is not, then BPF refuses to load the program.

But, to your point bpf_probe_read() can away access kernel memory and
assume structure layouts; so I guess a badly written bpf program can still do
all sorts of ABI-unstable things.

Good to know that the raw tracepoint being Ok since it is non-ABI; is where
we draw the line.
