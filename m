Unfortunately. Just wanted to highlight what to expect if we go down
that path. We can put it on a nice-to-have list, but don't expect or
rely on it to happen soon, given the implications above.

Maybe we need to optimize READ_ONCE().

'if (data_race(..))' would also work here and has no cost.

Agree. Still thinking if there is a way to do it without changing the
compiler, but I can't see it right now. :/
