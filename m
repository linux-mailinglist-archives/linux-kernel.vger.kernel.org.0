This looks too complicated as a workaround for a warning.

I got really confused. Probably also because the macro DECLARE_*()
does a definition instead of a declaration.

As a minimal fix, I suggest to rename log_wait -> printk_log_wait
and declare it in include/linux/printk.h.

Even better solution might be to move fs/proc/kmsg.c to
kernel/printk/proc_kmsg.c and declare printk_log_wait only
in kernel/printk/internal.h. I think that this is what
Sergey suggested.

Another great thing would be to extract devkmsg stuff from
kernel/printk/printk.c and put it into kernel/printk/dev_kmsg.c.

I am not sure but it might help people to realize that there
are actually two different interfaces (old in /proc dmesg-like,
and in /dev new for systemd). Sigh.

I am not sure how deep and far you would like to go ;-)

Best Regards,
Petr
