So soundwire is creating platform devices?  Ick, no!  Don't do that,
create a "real" device that is the root of your bus and attach that to
the platform/pci/whatever device that is the parent of that device's
resources.

kernel programming is hard.  Writing a new bus subsystem is even harder :(

Yes, that sounds better.  Don't mess with a platform device unless you
really have no other possible choice.  And even then, don't do it and
try to do something else.  Platform devices are really abused, don't
perpetuate it.
