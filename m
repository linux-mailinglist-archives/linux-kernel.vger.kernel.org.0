It's ugly.  Much more ugly than msg =

I don't understand the question.

No idea about this one either.

Basically, if you have T && T, the two T's have to be the same, and T is
not pure.  If you have T || T, then only one will be matched and T remains
pure.  If you have T on two separate ...s then you are in the && case.  If
you have T in two branches of a disjunction or in two whens on the same
... you are in the || case.  Just as you can use the variable e1 over and
over on the same when, you can use the same T.
