Dear Friend,

I came across your company's profile from the foreign trade office of our Chambers of Commerce and Industry and I decided to contact you for assistance in receiving money on my behalf for a good lucrative business investment in your country. My name is Mr. Richard Benson a branch bank manager here in Ghana. I have the sum of Sixteen Million, Four Hundred Thousand US Dollars which I would like to transfer into your account and invest in your country if possible into a lucrative business that will be profitable to us.
 
I made this money (US$16,400,000.00) out of my branch office excess profit. I choose you because I cannot be directly involved for I am still working with the bank, I hope you can understand my situation and assist me to receive and invest this money properly as this is my only hope. You will get 40% of the total fund as commission for your co-operation while 60% will be for me..
 
I need your timely response for more details.
 
With regards,
Mr. Richard Benson
