Keeping the trigger and result together like that would be better I think,
although the routine isn't supposed to run mid way through playback. If
we're mid playback the debugfs routine has to turn off AMP_ON, take the
device back to a known state, run diagnostics, then restore. Which causes
a gap in the audible sound.

The diagnostic status bits describe situations such as:
- open load (no speaker connected)
- short to GND
- short to VCC
- etc

The intention is to test if all the speakers are connected. So, one might 
have a self test which runs the diagnostic and verifies it outputs:

	00 00 00 00

For example, on my test rig there is only one speaker connected. So it
reads:

	04 04 00 04

Where the second bit is "open load". So this would fail the test.

So in the kcontrol case the test would be something like:

	amixer sset "AMP1 turn on diagnostic" on
	amixer sget "AMP1 diagnostic"

And the module parameter case:

	rmmod tda7802
	modprobe tda7802 turn_on_diagnostic=1
	dmesg | grep "Turn on diagnostic 04 04 04 04"
	rmmod tda7802
	modprobe tda7802

I think the module parameter method is more appropriate for a
"Turn-on diagnostic", even though I don't really like grepping dmesg
for the result. I'll go ahead and implement that unless anyone has a
particular preference for the kcontrol-trigger.

Thanks
