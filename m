=46rom my experience, the stable AI will pick up whatever they want to =
backport
not matter if there Is a =E2=80=9CFixes=E2=80=9D tag or not unless it is =
one of those subsystems like
Networking that exclusively manually flag for. backporting by the =
maintainer. =20

I have not had a chance to review all instances yet. It is not unusually =
to fix one
warning at a time, and then go on fixing some more if time permit.

How about disable them this way in a top level like arch/arm64/Makefile =
or
arch/arm64/kernel/Makefile? Therefore, there is no need to add this to
every file, but with a drawback that it could miss a few real issues =
there
in the future which probably not many people are checking for them of
the arm64 subsystem nowadays.

> Please just turn this off by default for clang.

As mentioned before, it is very valuable to run =E2=80=9Cmake W=3D1=E2=80=9D=
 given it found
many real developer mistakes which will enable =E2=80=9C-Woverride-init=E2=
=80=9D for both
compilers. Even =E2=80=9C-Woverride-init=E2=80=9D itself is useful find =
real issues as in,

ae5e033d65a (=E2=80=9Cmfd: rk808: Fix RK818_IRQ_DISCHG_ILIM =
initializer=E2=80=9D)
32df34d875bb (=E2=80=9C[media] rc: img-ir: jvc: Remove unused no-leader =
timings=E2=80=9D)

Especially, to find redundant initializations in large structures. e.g.,

e6ea0b917875 (=E2=80=9C[media] dvb_frontend: Don't declare values twice =
at a table=E2=80=9D)

It is important to keep the noise-level as low as possible by keeping =
the
amount of false positives under control to be truly benefit from those
valuable compiler warnings.=20

I am not sure that it is worth filling a RFE for compilers of that =
feature.
I feel like the range initializers just another way to initialize an =
array, and
 it is just easier to make mistakes with unintended =
double-initializations.
The compiler developers probably recommend to enforce more of
=E2=80=9C-Woverride-init=E2=80=9D for  the range initializers rather =
than permitting it.
