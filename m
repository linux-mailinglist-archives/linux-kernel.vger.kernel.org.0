That more or less exists in both cases, although rcg2_ops may need a
bit of additional work.  The problem is that in both cases, before
this snippet, we've already called qcom_find_freq(), and in both cases
(rcg_ops and rcg2_ops), f will be an invalid entry and we won't have
the proper pre_div value.

Got it.  Will do.
