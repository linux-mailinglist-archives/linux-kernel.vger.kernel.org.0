As Alexei said, with fentry/fexit the overhead should be on par with
your example. This functionality is pretty new, though, so I can
understand why it's not obvious how to do things with it yet :)

I think the best place to look is currently in selftests/bpf in the
kernel sources. Grep for 'fexit' and 'fentry' in the progs/ subdir.
test_overhead.c and kfree_skb.c seem to have some examples you may be
able to work from.

With BPF the solution for this is to distribute a tool that does all the
setup for the user. Basically the userspace equivalent of what you're
proposing to include into the kernel here. You can make this arbitrarily
user-friendly, up to and including having a GUI list all the functions
available in the running kernel and letting the user just click on the
one to measure :)
