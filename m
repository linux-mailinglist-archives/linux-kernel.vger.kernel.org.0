The line crashing the system (for some definition) and
working-as-intended is somewhat fuzzy (no pun intended). E.g. FIFREEZE
is it crashing the system if used uncarefully? Or connecting a USB
keyboard programmatically (which can inject CTRL+ALT+DEL)? Or turning
off console output?


> Or teach the fuzz tool not to do specific bad things.

We do some of this.
But generally it's impossible for anything that involves memory
indirections, or depends on the exact type of fd (e.g. all ioctl's),
etc. Boils down to halting problem and ability to predict exact
behavior of arbitrary programs.

I believe "coarse-grained" above refers to something different. We
don't disable whole subsystems (there are usually configs for that
already), but rather we have a single config that does small tweaks to
multiple subsystems (e.g. that single ioctl is disabled, etc). This
allows to still test majority of the subsystem, but just not that
single bit that is harmful.
