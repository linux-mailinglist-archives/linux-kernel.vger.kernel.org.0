I don't think SMMU limits any such programming of SIDs. It's a design 
decision
to program few SIDs in TZ/Hyp and allocate the corresponding context banks
and create respective mappings. You should be able to see these SMR 
configurations
before kernel boots up. I use a simple T32 command -

smmu.add "<name>" <smmu_type> <base_address>
smmu.streammaptable <name>

e.g. for sdm845 apps_smmu

smmu.add "apps" MMU500 a:0x15000000
smmu.StreamMapTable apps

This dumps all the information regarding the smmu.

I will get back with this information.
