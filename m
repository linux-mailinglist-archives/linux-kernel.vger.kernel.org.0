Yes this is the ucsi_acpi.c driver that has caused this issue to come
up. It does just use a region of memory carved in the BIOS out for the
purpose of this device. The kernel can write to this memory and call a
_DSM to push data to an EC or call the _DSM to pull from the EC into
this memory region. See
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/bios-implementation-of-ucsi.pdf
. The driver is very explicit about using uncached memory and I
suspect that is why memremap() was not used, but I am not sure why
uncahed memory is needed. The only consumers of this memory are the
driver itself and the ACPI asl code in the _DSM which as far as I know
is being exectued by the kernel directly. Are there any other reasons
to use uncached memory when dealing with ACPI asl code?
