Yes, this is a common pattern, but not all patterns that match the above
regex are broken.

The warnings are painful - and they're the main reason why I wrote this
change: - I wanted to avoid new warnings actually unrelated to my
changes that were sometimes appearing while doing incremental
"make htmldocs" on a big patchset that I've been rebasing almost every
week over the last two months.

-

Yet, did you try to look how this pattern will appear at the html and pdf
output? Something like this:

	sound/soc/codecs/wm8960.c: * Returns:
	sound/soc/codecs/wm8960.c- *  -1, in case no sysclk frequency available found
	sound/soc/codecs/wm8960.c- * >=0, in case we could derive bclk and lrclk from sysclk using
	sound/soc/codecs/wm8960.c- *      (@sysclk_idx, @dac_idx, @bclk_idx) dividers


Will be displayed as:

	**Returns:**
	  -1, in case no sysclk frequency available found **>=0, in case we could derive bclk and lrclk from sysclk using** (@sysclk_idx, @dac_idx, @bclk_idx) dividers


(where **foo**) means that "foo" will be printed in bold.

E. g. it will just merge all returns values into a single line and, if 
there are alignment differences, it will make the previous line bold
and produce a warning.

On some places, however, what's there will be properly displayed,
like this one:
**
 * wimax_reset - Reset a WiMAX device
 *
 * @wimax_dev: WiMAX device descriptor
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 * %0 if ok and a warm reset was done (the device still exists in
 * the system).
 *
 * -%ENODEV if a cold/bus reset had to be done (device has
 * disconnected and reconnected, so current handle is not valid
 * any more).
 *
 * -%EINVAL if the device is not even registered.
 *
 * Any other negative error code shall be considered as
 * non-recoverable.
 *

As there are blank lines between each value, making each return code a
different line.

This one:

tools/lib/traceevent/parse-filter.c: * Returns:
tools/lib/traceevent/parse-filter.c- *  1 if the two filters hold the same content.
tools/lib/traceevent/parse-filter.c- *  0 if they do not.

will also not mangle too much, as the dots will help for someone to 
understand, if reading the html/pdf output, like this:

	**Returns:**
	  1 if the two filters hold the same content. 0 if they do not.

So, it all depends on the context.

-

While it would likely be possible to improve kernel-doc to present better
results, I'm afraid that it would be too complex for simple regex
expressions, and hard to tune, as it would be a hint-based approach,
and doing a natural language processing would be too much effort.
