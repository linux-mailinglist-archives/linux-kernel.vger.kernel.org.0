Ok, I was just making sure you're not pinging because there's something
more urgent here. See below.

We try to track all stuff but x86 is super crazy most of the time,
especially currently, so stuff gets prioritized based on urgency and we
also try to round-robin through all submitters so that stuff doesn't get
left out.

Thus the one-week thing will never work with x86. Once a month ping
maybe.

In your case, since it is an improvement which is good to have but not
absolutely a must and not a bugfix, it is understandable that it would
get pushed back in priority.

But stuff usually won't be forgotten and we'll get to it eventually - it
is just that we're mega swamped all the time. :-\
