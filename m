Certainly!
I am new to this subsystem so I just wanted to get the discussion
started. I am happy to make a more specific function.

Thank you for pointing me to Peter's patch! No one in my team was aware
of his work on this. Ugh!
It appears that Peter left the company while trying to upstream his
patch and the situation just got stuck there for 4+ years now.

If you are still positive about the idea of a ima_file_hash function, I
will take his v6 patch (this is the latest I could find on the
sourceforce archives of linux-ima-devel), rebase it, take your comments
into account and send a new version by the end of the week.
