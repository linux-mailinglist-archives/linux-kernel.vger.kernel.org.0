Doing all of this with MAP_SECRET seems bad to me.  If user code wants
UC memory, it should ask for UC memory -- having the kernel involved
in the decision to use UC memory is a bad idea, because the
performance impact of using UC memory where user code wasn't expecting
it wil be so bad that the system might as well not work at all.  (For
kicks, I once added a sysctl to turn off caching in CR0.  I enabled it
in gnome-shell.  The system slowed down to such an extent that I was
unable to enter the three or so keystrokes to turn it back off.)

EXCLUSIVE makes sense.  Saying "don't ptrace this" makes sense.  UC
makes sense.  But having one flag to rule them all does not make sense
to me.
