I can be easily wrong, I never read this code before, but this doesn't
look correct.

Firstly, mm->mmap_sem cam ONLY help if a) the task already has mm_slot
and b) this mm_slot is khugepaged_scan.mm_slot. Otherwise khugepaged_exit()
won't take mmap_sem for writing and thus we can't rely on test_exit().

and this means that down_read(mmap_sem) before khugepaged_add_pte_mapped_thp()
is pointless and can't help; this mm was found by vma_interval_tree_foreach().

so __khugepaged_enter() can race with khugepaged_exit() and this is wrong
in any case.

Well. In this particular case khugepaged_enter() was likely already called
by shmem_mmap() or khugepaged_enter_vma_merge(), or madvise.

(in fact I think do_set_pmd() or shmem_fault() should call _enter() too,
 like do_huge_pmd_anonymous_page() does, but this is another story).


And I forgot to mention... I don't understand why
khugepaged_collapse_pte_mapped_thps() has to be called with khugepaged_mm_lock.

Oleg.
