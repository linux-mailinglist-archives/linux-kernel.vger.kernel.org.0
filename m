(pre-coffee, but let's hope the brain is awake enough)

This asymmetry in prime import/export is somewhat common for devices
with funky dma requirements/setup in the dt/soc world.

- on export we need to use the "official" struct device, so that when
we re-import (i.e. userspace just shared a buffer across process
through fd-passing, not across device-drivers) the common helpers
realize "ah this is ours, let me just grab the underlying buffer
object", instead of creating a full new buffer object handle like it
does for a real import of a dma-buf from a different device driver.
Because having 2 buffer object handles pointing at the same underlying
buffer objects tends to not go well.

- on import otoh we need to pass the struct device we actually need
for dma (which for reasons that I don't fully grok isn't the same, I
got it explained once by dt/soc folks and forgot again why exactly),
so that dma_map_sg and friends dtrt.

So that part should be all fine.
