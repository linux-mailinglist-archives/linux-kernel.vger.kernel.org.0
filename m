I always run the rcutorture test with patch because the patch doesn't really
do anything if rcuperf.kfree_no_batch=0. This parameter is added so that in
the future folks can compare effect of non-batching with that of the
batching. However, I can also remove the patch itself and run this test
again.

Ok, sure.

You're right, I had added this before but it is unused now. Sorry about that,
I will remove it.

Yes, complete screw up, will update it.

Sure, should I split that into a separate patch?

:-D Ok, I will improve the names.

I did not follow, are you referring to the measurement inaccuracy related to
the "kfree_perf_thread task started" string print?  Or, are you saying that
ktime_get_mono_fast_ns() has to start earlier than over here?

I am getting pretty reliable and repeatable results with this test. The sleep
was mostly just to give the system a chance to scheduler other tasks. I can
remove the schedule and also try with just cond_resched().

The other reason for the schedule call was also to give the test a longer
running time and help with easier measurement as a result, since the test
would run otherwise for a very shortwhile. Agreed there might be a better way
to handle this issue.

(I will reply to the rest of the comments below in a bit, I am going to a
hospital now to visit a sick relative and will be back a bit later.)

thanks!
