Exactly, and not only the PMC, we can basically start giving out actual
vectors on register_nmi_handler() and do away with all that shared line
crap.

And then the actual NMI line will be mostly empty again, and it can read
its stupid slow reason port again.

One complication though; IRET et al only do EFLAGS, not CR8, so that's
going to be massive fun :-(

Did I say I hates the x86 interrupt scheme?
