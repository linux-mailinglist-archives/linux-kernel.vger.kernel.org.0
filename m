When a cpu requests broadcasting, before starting the tick broadcast
hrtimer, bc_set_next() checks if the timer callback (bc_handler) is
active using hrtimer_try_to_cancel(). But hrtimer_try_to_cancel() does
not provide the required synchronization when the callback is active on
other core.
The callback could have already executed
tick_handle_oneshot_broadcast() and could have also returned. But still
there is a small time window where the hrtimer_try_to_cancel() returns
-1. In that case bc_set_next() returns without doing anything, but the
next_event of the tick broadcast clock device is already set to a
timeout value.

In the race condition diagram below, CPU #1 is running the timer
callback and CPU #2 is entering idle state and so calls bc_set_next().

In the worst case, the next_event will contain an expiry time, but the
hrtimer will not be started which happens when the racing callback
returns HRTIMER_NORESTART. The hrtimer might never recover if all
further requests from the CPUs to subscribe to tick broadcast have
timeout greater than the next_event of tick broadcast clock device. This
leads to cascading of failures and finally noticed as rcu stall
warnings.

Here is a depiction of the race condition

CPU #1 (Running timer callback)                   CPU #2 (Enter idle
                                                  and subscribe to
                                                  tick broadcast)
---------------------                             ---------------------

__run_hrtimer()                                   tick_broadcast_enter()

  bc_handler()                                      __tick_broadcast_oneshot_control()

    tick_handle_oneshot_broadcast()

      raw_spin_lock(&tick_broadcast_lock);

      dev->next_event = KTIME_MAX;                  //wait for tick_broadcast_lock
      //next_event for tick broadcast clock
      set to KTIME_MAX since no other cores
      subscribed to tick broadcasting

      raw_spin_unlock(&tick_broadcast_lock);

    if (dev->next_event == KTIME_MAX)
      return HRTIMER_NORESTART
    // callback function exits without
       restarting the hrtimer                      //tick_broadcast_lock acquired
                                                   raw_spin_lock(&tick_broadcast_lock);

                                                   tick_broadcast_set_event()

                                                     clockevents_program_event()

                                                       dev->next_event = expires;

                                                       bc_set_next()

                                                         hrtimer_try_to_cancel()
                                                         //returns -1 since the timer
                                                         callback is active. Exits without
                                                         restarting the timer
  cpu_base->running = NULL;

In the fix, if hrtimer_try_to_cancel returns callback is active, an
additional check is added in bc_set_next() to know the state of the
timer callback.  If the timer callback has already released the
tick_broadcast_lock, then the bc_set_next() can safely call
hrtimer_cancel() to cancel the timer and restart it.

When there are no more cpus subscribed to broadcast, the timer callback
might not set the expiry time for hrtimer. Therefore the callback timer
function is modified to set the state of broadcast clock to
CLOCK_EVT_STATE_ONESHOT_STOPPED which in turn will set the expiry time
of hrtimer to KTIME_MAX.
