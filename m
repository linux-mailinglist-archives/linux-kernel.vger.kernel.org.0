You made the PMC/CaR changes before the audio changes, the clk_out_1_mux
won't exist for the audio driver patches.

If you care about bisect-ability of the patches, then the clock and
audio changes need to be done in a single patch. But I don't think that
it's worthwhile.

Why additional fallback? Additional to what?

Sorry, I don't understand what you're meaning by the "new changes".
