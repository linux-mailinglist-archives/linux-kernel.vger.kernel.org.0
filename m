Sure, not great. But the thread can possibly still run on CPU0.

Not in the strictest sense for us, I don't know about others. Currently 
we use tasklets, and we find that the CPUs servicing the interrupts (and 
hence tasklets) are heavily loaded. We experience the same for when 
experimenting with threaded interrupt handlers - which would be as expected.

But, when we make the change as mentioned, our IOPS goes from ~3M -> 3.4M.

I would say that a. CPU0 not always having to deal with the interrupt 
handler+threaded part b. less context switching from a. would be factors 
in this.

Thanks,
John
