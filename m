So, use bigger temporary buffer and decide what to do with data if it doesn't
fit the destination one.

String without nul is not considered as a string, thus, memcpy() the data.

Yes. The data you are expecting is not a string anymore from these functions
point of view. Even GCC nowadays complains on strncpy() when nul doesn't fit
the destination buffer.

My personal view is not a consensus, let's wait for more opinions.
