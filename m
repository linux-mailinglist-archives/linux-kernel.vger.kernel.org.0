-Ever since its introduction last October, the BusLogic FlashPoint LT has

-drivers have been available for this new Ultra SCSI product.  Despite its
-officially being positioned as a desktop workstation product, and not being

-made available, and that Linux users who mistakenly ordered systems with
-the FlashPoint would be able to upgrade to the BT-946C.  While this helped
-many purchasers of new systems, it was only a partial solution to the
-overall problem of FlashPoint support for Linux users.  It did nothing to

-operating system and then later decided to run Linux, or those who had
-ended up with a FlashPoint LT, believing it was supported, and were unable

-In the middle of December, I asked to meet with BusLogic's senior
-management to discuss the issues related to Linux and free software support
-for the FlashPoint.  Rumors of varying accuracy had been circulating
-publicly about BusLogic's attitude toward the Linux community, and I felt
-it was best that these issues be addressed directly.  I sent an email
-message after 11pm one evening, and the meeting took place the next
-afternoon.  Unfortunately, corporate wheels sometimes grind slowly,
-especially when a company is being acquired, and so it's taken until now
-before the details were completely determined and a public statement could
-be made.

-BusLogic is not prepared at this time to release the information necessary
-for third parties to write drivers for the FlashPoint.  The only existing
-FlashPoint drivers have been written directly by BusLogic Engineering, and
-there is no FlashPoint documentation sufficiently detailed to allow outside
-developers to write a driver without substantial assistance.  While there
-are people at BusLogic who would rather not release the details of the
-FlashPoint architecture at all, that debate has not yet been settled either
-way.  In any event, even if documentation were available today it would
-take quite a while for a usable driver to be written, especially since I'm
-not convinced that the effort required would be worthwhile.

-However, BusLogic does remain committed to providing a high performance

-has put in place a direct upgrade program to allow any Linux user worldwide
-to trade in their FlashPoint LT for the new BT-948 MultiMaster PCI Ultra

-and has all the best features of both the BT-946C and FlashPoint LT,
-including smart termination and a flash PROM for easy firmware updates, and
-is of course compatible with the present Linux driver.  The price for this
-upgrade has been set at US $45 plus shipping and handling, and the upgrade

-I was a beta test site for the BT-948/958, and versions 1.2.1 and 1.3.1 of

-Additional cosmetic support for the Ultra SCSI MultiMaster cards was added
-subsequent releases.  As a result of this cooperative testing process,
-several firmware bugs were found and corrected.  My heavily loaded Linux
-test system provided an ideal environment for testing error recovery
-processes that are much more rarely exercised in production systems, but
-are crucial to overall system stability.  It was especially convenient
-being able to work directly with their firmware engineer in demonstrating
-the problems under control of the firmware debugging environment; things
-sure have come a long way since the last time I worked on firmware for an
-embedded system.  I am presently working on some performance testing and
-expect to have some data to report in the not too distant future.

-directly via email, or have appeared in the Linux newsgroups in which I
-participate.  To summarize, BusLogic is offering Linux users an upgrade
