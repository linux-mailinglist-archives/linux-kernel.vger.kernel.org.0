Assuming you mean the case where the physical address (as seen by the
CPU) is different from the dma address (as seen by the GPU), then I
highly doubt it because mali_kbase doesn't support it:

[from kbase_mem_pool_alloc_page() in mali_kbase_mem_pool.c]:

	dma_addr = dma_map_page(dev, p, 0, PAGE_SIZE, DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
	if (dma_mapping_error(dev, dma_addr)) {
		__free_page(p);
		return NULL;
	}

	WARN_ON(dma_addr != page_to_phys(p));


That being said it's quite possible there could be something in the bus
which needs configuring to make this work - in which case your best bet
is to look at the vendor kernel and see if anything extra is poked when
the Mali driver is loaded.
