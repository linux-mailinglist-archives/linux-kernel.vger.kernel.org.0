Because you added another badly designed caching layer instead of fixing
up one of the 2 to 3 (depending on how you count) in the kernel tree.
And yours is amazingly bad even compared to the not very nice one in the
tree.  It basically spends more efforts on abstracting away abstraction
that you wouldn't need without another layer of abstractions.  And it
does all that pointlessly tied to NVMe through a bunch of layering
violations.

It is not.  We will not let random kernel modules directly issue nvme
admin command as there is no reason for it.  And even if for some weird
reason we did we'd certainly not do it for out of tree modules.

And the answer is that we are not going to allow that.  And we'd not
allow other things even if they were not a bad design for out of tree
modules.
