We don't care about any of this information...

I would say:

"Kernel style says not to split string literals across mutliple lines
because it makes it difficult to grep the source for the printk.  I have
changed the code accordingly.  It will not affect runtime."

That's not imperative and some subsystems are more strict about "you're
not allowed to use the words 'I', 'we' or 'this patch'" in a commit
description.  But in staging we are pragmatists.  So long as it's clear
why you're writing the patch that's the main thing.

The other problem with this code is that some of these messages are over
80 characters long themselves which is very long for one line.

It doesn't matter if you send the v2 as a reply or not.

dan carpenter
