I don't really mind either way.  The function of the fixes tag isn't to
say there was a fatal bug it's to say if you think you're fixing
something where was the origin of the problem, however minor the
problem is.

I do agree that Sasha's autosel stuff does seem to be triggering off
Fixes and we don't want to see hundreds of autosel patches trying to
apply this to older trees, so removing the fixes tag to avoid this is
fine with me.
