I don't think we ever care about the low bits of the address below the
page mask, so this one probably wouldn't make any difference.

To match the other cases, I'd make it just a plain

        WARN_ON_ONCE(start & ~PAGE_MASK));

and leave it at that. The existing commit added the warning, but then
just made the code work despite it all.  I'd continue that same logic.

Again, I think to match the other cases, I'd just do

-                       addr += PMD_SIZE;
+                       WARN_ON_ONCE(addr & ~PMD_MASK);
+                       addr = round_up(addr + 1, PMD_SIZE);

which now admittedly clones too much, but _does_ clone the requested range.

But maybe it really doesn't matter, since this condition just
shouldn't happen in the first place.

And arguably, the "clone more than requested" issue is true, and maybe
your "warn and refuse to clone by returning" is the right thing to do.

So I have very few strong opinions in this area, I just reacted to
looking at the patch that it didn't seem to cover all the cases.

Ok, thanks for the explanation.
