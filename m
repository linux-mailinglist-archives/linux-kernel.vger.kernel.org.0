I will give a real-life example. Say, I have some patches in my
local tree and they've been developed by somebody who is no longer
interested/paid to upstream those.

I first submit those patches with the original authorship, plus my SoB.
Then, the reviewers post their findings. I put my time into fixing those
and re-testing the patch or the entire series. The final patch/series
may look totally different compared to the original one.

Which way would you suggest to give credits to the original author?
I personally think that "Co-developed-by:" conveys the idea/feeling of
"teaming up" with somebody, which doesn't happen in my example.
