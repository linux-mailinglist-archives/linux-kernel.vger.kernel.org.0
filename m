Good point on the capacity reduction vs group_is_overloaded.

That said, can't we also reach this with migrate_task? Say the local
group is entirely idle, and the busiest group has a few non-idle CPUs
but they all have at most 1 running task. AFAICT we would still go to
calculate_imbalance(), and try to balance out the number of idle CPUs.

If the migration_type is migrate_util, that can't happen because of this
change. Since we have this progressive balancing strategy (tasks -> util
-> load), it's a bit odd to have this "gap" in the middle where we get
one less possibility to trigger active balance, don't you think? That
is, providing I didn't say nonsense again :)

It's not a super big deal, but I think it's nice if we can maintain a
consistent / gradual migration policy.
