Change above to:

When devices are added, the bus may create device links to track which
suppliers a consumer device depends upon.  This
tracking of supplier-consumer relationship may be used to defer probing
the driver of a consumer device before the driver(s) for its supplier device(s)
are probed.  It may also be used by a supplier driver to determine if
all of its consumers have been successfully probed.
The add_links bus callback is added to create the supplier device links

> device to link to despite needing mandatory resources/functionality from
> one or more suppliers. A waiting_for_suppliers list is created to track
> such consumers and retry linking them when new devices get added.

Change above to:

If a supplier device has not yet been created when the consumer device attempts
to link it, the consumer device is added to the wait_for_suppliers list.
When supplier devices are created, the supplier device link will be added to
the relevant consumer devices on the wait_for_suppliers list.

Change above comment to:

    * device_link_add_supplier_links - add links from consumer devices to
    *                                  supplier devices, leaving any consumer
    *                                  with inactive suppliers on the
    *                                  wait_for_suppliers list

    * Scan all consumer devices in the devicetree.  For any supplier device that
    * is not already linked to the consumer device, add the supplier to the
    * consumer device's device links.
    *
    * If all of a consumer device's suppliers are available then the consumer
    * is removed from the wait_for_suppliers list (if previously on the list).
    * Otherwise the consumer is added to the wait_for_suppliers list (if not
    * already on the list).


    * The add_links bus callback must return 0 if it has found and added all
    * the supplier links for the consumer device. It must return an error if
    * it is not able to do so.
    *
    * The caller of device_link_wait_for_supplier() is expected to call this once
    * it is aware of potential suppliers becoming available.

Function name is misleading and hides side effects.

I have not come up with a name that does not hide side effects, but a better
name would be:

   device_link_add_supplier_links()

Empties dev->links.needs_suppliers, but does not remove dev from
wait_for_suppliers list.  Where does that happen?

Change comment to:

	/*

	 */

Update Documentation/driver-api/device_link.rst to reflect the
check of &dev->links.needs_suppliers in device_links_check_suppliers().
