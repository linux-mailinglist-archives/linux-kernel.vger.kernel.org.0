Yes, only Alpha needs an actual memory-barrier instruction in
rcu_dereference().  And it is the only one that gets one.

But rcu_assign_pointer() needs a memory-barrier instruction on the
weakly ordered architectures: ARM, powerpc, Itanium, and so on.

The rcu_assign_pointer() at the end of rcuwait_wait_event(), right?

Note the difference between the read-side rcu_dereference(), which
does not require any memory-barrier instructions except on Alpha,
and the update-side rcu_assign_pointer() which does require a
memory-barrier instruction on quite a few architectures.  Even on
the strongly ordered architectures (x86, s390, ...) a compiler
barrier() is required for rcu_assign_pointer().

Except note the exceptional cases where RCU_INIT_POINTER() may be
used in place of rcu_assign_pointer(), which are called out in
RCU_INIT_POINTER()'s header comment:

 * Initialize an RCU-protected pointer in special cases where readers
 * do not need ordering constraints on the CPU or the compiler.  These
 * special cases are:
 *
 * 1.	This use of RCU_INIT_POINTER() is NULLing out the pointer *or*
 * 2.	The caller has taken whatever steps are required to prevent
 *	RCU readers from concurrently accessing this pointer *or*
 * 3.	The referenced data structure has already been exposed to
 *	readers either at compile time or via rcu_assign_pointer() *and*
 *
 *	a.	You have not made *any* reader-visible changes to
 *		this structure since then *or*
 *	b.	It is OK for readers accessing this structure from its
 *		new location to see the old state of the structure.  (For
 *		example, the changes were to statistical counters or to
 *		other state where exact synchronization is not required.)
 *
 * Failure to follow these rules governing use of RCU_INIT_POINTER() will
 * result in impossible-to-diagnose memory corruption.  As in the structures
 * will look OK in crash dumps, but any concurrent RCU readers might
 * see pre-initialized values of the referenced data structure.  So
 * please be very careful how you use RCU_INIT_POINTER()!!!

If current is already visible (which it should be unless
rcuwait_wait_event() is invoked at task-creation time), then
RCU_INIT_POINTER() could be used in rcuwait_wait_event().

Congratulations on the baby son!!!  I remember those times well, but
they were more than three decades ago for my oldest.  ;-)

Looking forward to it!
