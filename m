Rename the FMC documentation files to ReST, add an
index for them and adjust in order to produce a nice html
output via the Sphinx build system.

At least some of this files seemed to be using some markup
language similar to ReST, but with a different markup for
cross-references. Adjust those to use the ReST syntax.

At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
