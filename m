For drm drivers that you actually want to hotunplug (as opposed to more
just for driver development) they all use system memory/shmem, so
shouldn't sigbus. I think at least, I haven't tested anything. This is for
udl, or the tiny displays behind an spi bridge.

For pci drivers where the mmap often points at a pci bridge the mmio range
will be gone, so not SIGBUSing is going to be a tough order. Not
impossible, but before we enshrine this into uapi someont will have to do
some serious typing.

Mesa already blows up in all kinds of interesting ways when it gets an EIO
at execbuf. I think. Robust handling of gpu hotunplug for gl/vk contexts
is going to be more work on top (and mmap is probably the least issue
there, at least right now).

I agree with you that SIGBUS for mmap of hotunplugged devices is
essentially unusable because sighandlers and all what you point out (would
make it impossible to have robust vk/gl contexts, at least robuts against
hotunplug).

So in principle I'm open to have some other uapi for this, but it's going
to be serios amounts of work across the stack.

For display only udl-style devices otoh I think we should be mostly there,
+/- driver bugs as usual.
