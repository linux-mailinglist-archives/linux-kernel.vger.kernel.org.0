The term "IIO" (Integrated IO) in that context refers to set of PMUs 
which are
responsible for monitoring traffic crossing PCIe domain boundaries. It's 
specific
for Intel Xeon server line and supported by Linux kernel perf tool 
starting v4.9.
So I'm just referring to what's already in the kernel :)

It's interface to corresponding IIO PMU, should be struct device

Just for convenience. I can put it the same level as other attributes 
(cpumask etc).
Please let me know which layout to choose.

Sure! The linux perf tool will use it to attribute IO traffic to devices.
Initially the feature was sent for review containing both kernel[1] and
user space[2] parts, but later it was decided to finalize kernel part first
and then proceed with user space.

The IIO PMUs by design monitors traffic crossing integrated pci root ports.
For each IIO PMU the feature creates symlinks to itsÂ  pci root port on 
each node.
Those pci devices, by its nature, can not be "just removed". If the SOC is
designed the way that some integrated root port is not present
then the case will be correctly handled by the feature.
