That old document is pretty damn accurate. At least one feature was
quietly removed over the years. And some ioctls no longer do anything
(see the ioctl table towards the end of the above document). The sg
driver's public interface is a lot more stable than the kernel API behind
it :-) . There is driver in FreeBSD that implements that interface, it's
called scsi_sg .

Editorial comments welcome.

Martin Petersen wants to see that document reworked in order to market the
new features that I am proposing. My approach is to document the code that
I have in front of me ***, plus add a bit of historical context.

I chose that format so I could add diagrams (using Libreoffice writer).
Do those diagrams help?

Doug Gilbert


*** it helps me find bugs in my code and my documentation. I'm also testing
     the code at the same time.
