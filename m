I'm not sure it should be archived forever in the commit message.
The benchmark was run on A-step silicon, so may not be representative
of production results.

Yes FSRM implies ERMS

You can't use REP MOVS for overlapping src/dst strings (not even with the fancy
newer, faster, shinier FSRM version). So your suggestion will not work.

The old memmove code looked something like:

	if (len < 32)
		copy tail (backwards ... 8/4/2/1 bytes. works for both overlap & non-overlap case)
		return
	else if overlap src/dst
		copy backwards 32-byte unrolled
		copy tail
		return
	else if (ERMS)
		REP MOVS;
		return
	else
		unrolled copy 32-byte
		copy tail

The new one with my changes looks something like

	if (! overlap src/dst)
		if (FSRM)
			rep movs
			return
		if (len < 32)
			copy tail
			return
		if (ERMS)
			rep movs
			return
		unrolled copy
	else
		if (len < 32)
			copy tail
			return
		copy backwards 32-byte unrolled
		copy tail
