Hmm, with the current layout which is:

    if (curr->hardirq_threaded || curr->irq_config)
        curr_inner = LD_WAIT_CONFIG;
    else
        curr_inner = LD_WAIT_SPIN;

you are not protected against that.

But anyway none of that should happen if hardirq_threaded and irq_config
are respectively only used when hardirq threads are disabled and irq_work
is always hardirq, right?
