From what I understand, "noinline_for_stack" is just noinline and the
"for_stack" part is just to document that the noinline is used for
stack purposes. If the compiler doesn't inline the function without the
noinline, then it wont make any difference.

The point was to not inline the function because it can be used in
stack critical areas, and that it's better to do the call than to
increase the stack.

Although the commit you posted is back in 2010, and compilers and I
think even our stack size has changed since then. This may not be a
critical issue today, and just making it static and letting the
compiler decide might be the right solution.

Let's add Yue's patch as is for now, and perhaps revisit this as a
separate thread.
