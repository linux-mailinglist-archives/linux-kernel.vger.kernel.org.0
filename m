Not really.  You just want the attributes on the platform device itself.

Given the horrible hack that platform devices are today, what's one more
hack!

Here's a patch below of what should probably be done here.  Richard, can
you change your code to use the new dev_groups pointer in the struct
platform_driver and this patch and let me know if that works or not?

Note, I've only compiled this code, not tested it...

thanks,
