I'm not sure if I can safely remove panfrost_regulator_init() because
it calls regulator_enable()
but there's no regulator_enable() equivalent in devfreq or OPP

I'm not sure how this is supposed to work
if someone has an idea: please let me know

OK, if you know anybody who could help then please Cc them
