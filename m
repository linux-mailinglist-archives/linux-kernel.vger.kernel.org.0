Just a heads up that I have sent review issues in reply to version 7 of this
patch series.

We'll see what the responses are to my review comments, but I am expecting
the changes are big enough to result in a new version (or a couple more
versions) of the patch series.

No rush to revert version 9 since your 5.4-rc1 pull request is still not
near, and I am glad for whatever exposure these patches are getting in
linux-next.

Thanks,

Frank
