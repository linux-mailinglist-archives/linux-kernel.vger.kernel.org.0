If it is so complex, then it should not be in DT. Things like
describing clocks at the gate/mux/divider level turned out to be too
complex to get right or complete, so we avoid that.

I misunderstood. I now see this is back to duplicating all the data
that's already there which I've already said no to.

So if we have 10 dependencies and 1 to ignore, we're going to list the
9 dependencies? And if I want to know where the cycle is, I have to
figure out which 1 of the 10 dependencies you omitted. Pick black or
white list with what's going to be shortest in the common case.

Also, when new dependencies are added to a node, we'd have to check
that the dependency is added to 'depends-on' (or was it not on
purpose).

Perhaps, though I'm doubtful the drivers for them could be both
required at probe and built as modules.

I'm all for generic properties, but not if we only have hypothetical
cases for anything beyond clocks. I know clocks are a somewhat common
problem because it has come up before. I'm just asking for specific
example that's not clocks.

Part of the problem is we can't really police how a generic property
is used. Maybe Linux is only using it for cycles, but then u-boot
folks may think it works well for other reasons. Maybe a dtc check
could mitigate that. Warn on any dependencies that are not a cycle.
Actually, you could add a check for any cycles first and then we can
see where all they exist.
