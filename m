Thanks for the test.

i_pino is also valid on regular inode, because after sudden power-cut case, we
will recover fsynced file and link it into parent directory which i_pino field
points.

For rename/cross_rename cases, we just tag src/dst regular inode with
parent_lost flag instead of updating its i_pino field, once there is fsync()
comes after rename(), we will trigger checkpoint for such parent lost inode to
keep rename/cross_rename operation as an atomic operation.
