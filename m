arg[1,7] are already provided by the client, so it is only neater if
arg0 is also taken from the client.

But as I said, I am still ok if func-id is passed from dt and arg0
from client is ignored because we have one channel per controller
design and we don't have to worry about number of channels there can
be dedicated to specific functions.

Do we want to do away with 'method' property and use different
'compatible' properties instead?
 compatible =3D "arm,smc-mbox";     or    compatible =3D "arm,hvc-mbox";

That paranoia is unwarranted. We have to keep faith in kernel-space
code doing the right thing.
Either the illegitimate function request should be rejected by the
firmware or client driver be called buggy.... just as we would call a
block device driver buggy if it messed up the sector numbers in a
write request.

thnx.
