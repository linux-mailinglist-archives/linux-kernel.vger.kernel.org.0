So, you're looking at the scsi_io_completion() code path. In my
experience that isn't reliable for bug hunting because of the the
message rate limiting. Therefore I prefer using SCSI logging
MLCOMPLETE=1, where no rate limiting applies. But that's just a side
note, it depends on the case what's more useful.

Back to the cmd age output, IMO we're are on a thin line between
capturing useful information and keeping the logs neat. As I already
said, I'm not convinced that this information, as important it may be
for the case(s) you're currently investigating, has the same generic
degree of importance or usefulness as what's currently printed (the CDB
and the sense data). But OTOH, that's just a gut feeling, and I can't
claim to have the experience to make general statement on it. If noone
else has issues with this being printed by default, I'm not going
oppose it.

You are certainly aware that such scripts don't necessarily conform to
what kernel developers would consider "ideal" :-) But again, I just
wanted to raise the issue; if noone else thinks it matters, fine with
me.

Thanks
