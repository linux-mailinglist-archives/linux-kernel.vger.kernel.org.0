I'm sorry for the delay. But now I'm able to give you a detailed feedback:

The general problem is, that your solution is customized to a single
use-case: preventing softirq raise but only if there is _no_ timer
pending. To reach this goal without using locks, overhead is added to the
formerly optimized add/mod path of a timer. With your code the timer
softirq is raised even when there is a pending timer which does not has to
be expired right now. But there have been requests in the past for this use
case already.

I discussed with Thomas several approaches during the last week how to
solve the unconditional softirq timer raise in a more general way without
loosing the fast add/mod path of a timer. The approach which seems to be
the best has a dependency on a timer code change from a push to pull model
which is still under developement (see v2 patchset:
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20170418111102.490432548@linutronix.de). The
patchset v2 has several problems but we are working on a solution for those
problems right now. When the timer pull model is in place the approach to
solve the unconditional timer softirq raise could look like the following:

---8<---
The next_expiry value of timer_base struct is used to store the next expiry
value even if timer_base is not idle. Therefore it is udpated after adding
or modifying a timer and also at the end of timer softirq. In case timer
softirq does not has to be raised, the timer_base->clk is incremented to
prevent stale clocks. Checking whether timer softirq has to be raised
cannot be done lockless.

This code is not compile tested nor boot tested.
