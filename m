Acer C720 did not use ACPI to describe its devices, it relied on static
board support to instantiate touchscreen and trackpad and other devices.
Does the new kernel work with the original firmware (it should as that's
what it's been tested with)?

I see that MrChromebox BIOS declares the peripherals on Peppy via ACPI.
I'd recommend reaching out and ask to update the binding (maybe switch
from ATML0001 to PRP0001 and full OF-style binding to avoid confusion).

Thanks.
