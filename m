Uh, so I think for the HiKey960, the type-A ports on the hub are
separately powered via the hub_power_ctrl(hisi_hikey_usb,
HUB_VBUS_POWER_OFF/ON) call.

At least, with the current driver, the functionality is working as
expected: remove the USB-C cable, and devices connected to the hub
power on, plug something into the USB-C port and devices plugged into
the hub shutdown.

But maybe I'm missing what you mean?

Ok. I'm happy to stick with what works here, since it is at least the
oddness is isolated to the device specific hub driver.
