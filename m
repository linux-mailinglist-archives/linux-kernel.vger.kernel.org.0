Right, those are used to keep the clock values coherent (as best as
possible) when we switch modes.

When the TSC is stable sched_clock_cpu() is mapped directly to
sched_clock() for performance reasons. The moment the TSC is detected to
be unsuitable, we switch to the unstable mode, where we take a GTOD
timestamp every tick and add resolution with the CPU local TSC (plus
filters etc..).

To make this mode-switch as smooth as possible, we track those offsets.

Either local_clock() or cpu_clock(cpu). The sleep hooks are not
something the consumer has to worry about.

Yes.

If an architecture doesn't provide a sched_clock(), you're on a
seriously handicapped arch. It wraps in ~500 days, and aside from
changing jiffies_lock to a latch, I don't think we can do much about it.

(the scheduler too expects sched_clock() to not wrap short of the u64
and so having those machines online for 500 days will get you 'funny'
results)

AFAICT only: alpha, h8300, hexagon, m68knommu, nds32, nios2, openrisc
are lacking any form of sched_clock(), the rest has it either natively
or through sched_clock_register().

You probably want to use local_clock().
