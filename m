This looks good to me. The only slight concern I have with it is
making the overlay filename an ABI. I don't have a better suggestion
though. How would this work for other vendors or the same panel ID
(for different panels) used on different platforms? For different
vendors at least, I guess dtbloader gets the base dtb path somehow and
the overlay's are relative to that?

It's the base dtb that needs the symbols I think.

BTW, to answer the question on #dri-devel, if you wanted to put the
full panel into an overlay, the way to solve the problem of having
bridge specific knowledge is defining a connector node. That should
provide enough abstraction. Presumably the connector is actually the
same across panels in this situation, so that should match up with the
actual h/w. It could be possible to have a different physical
connector populated for each possible panel, but hopefully that's not
the common case.
