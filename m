The patch is fine and I can apply it (I don't think there are any
restrictions on sleeping in sysfs), but this code only gets executed
when you actually read the power status from the card (e.g., via sysfs
or debugfs).  Presumably you have something in userspace polling one
of those files on a regular basis?
