Ok, thanks for the clarification.
This fact of course simplifies the whole issue.

I just wanted to be on the safe side :-) since I personally
have only 2 of the 25+ affected systems here for testing.
But I now understand that if it works on the tested two
A20 systems, then it normally should work on all of the
affected different boards/models as they all are using
the same SATA/AHCI-IP-Core, much like you also stated.

But of course I still wouldn't like it if someone loses data
and possibly blames my patch or even me myself, as the issue
is indeed a sensitive one where data loss (corruption of the
filesystem, partition, or the partition table) can indeed happen.
To be honest, it happened to me during my experiments with
some wrong, too high, values.
But I think the current version is mature and stable.

Yes, I did, but not that extensively yet. So far I couldn't see any
difference in the outcome.
There is in the TI doc just the following statement regarding this:

"Note that programming a burst size of greater than a transaction size,
while not invalid, is meaningless because the DMA maximizes out at
transaction size." (Ch. 3.4 DMA, p.15 in the TI doc).

I understand this as a neutral statement, ie. it doesn't hurt or make
any difference in practice if one sets TXABL effectively higher than
TXTS and/or RXABL effectively higher than RXTS,
FYI: these value are just some index-values, ie. index-value x means real value y.
0 for TXABL and/or RXABL means "Limit VBUSP burst size to 256 DWORDS",
ie. to the highest possible value for Transmit Burst Limit (TXABL) and
Receive Burst Limit (RXABL), respectively.

I'll test this alternative version now extensively in my test series.

But I could need an advice on what step I should take next in this
issue regarding getting the patch merged into the mainline kernel.
Shall I post a v3 of the patch with RFC removed, some more comments
added, and switching to the above alternative function argument
together with its test results, or shall I do these additions only
after the current version has already been merged into the kernel?
[actually I'm now unsure if patches with "RFC" flag ever get merged :-].

Thx.
