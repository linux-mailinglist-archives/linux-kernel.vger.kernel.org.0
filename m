What I need is some way for userspace to tell the driver parameters for the display refresh (driving waveforms, refresh speed etc.) on a frame-by-frame basis. These parameters depend on ambient temperature and the displayed content. One has to trade off speed, ghosting and the number of possible partial refreshes until next full one.

> Usually, epaper display refresh all pixels at once like an LCD would. This takes about 15s of flickering for b/w/red displays. Since they're bistable, they can also only physically refresh part of the area though. The reason for not having that on-by-default is that epaper partial refresh is really tricky. If you refresh the same area partially a few times, charge builds up, image quality degrades and the picture starts bleeding. If you refresh the same area partially all the time and don't do enough full refresh cycles to balance charges again, eventually the display is going to get permanent burn-in. I think partial refresh should be supported by a driver like this since it's a good tool to alleviate the enormous full refresh times.

For example you might want a LUT specifying more inversion cycles for text display to reduce ghosting, or one with less cycles but higher voltages for some spinning loading animation to reduce flickering. If you are displaying a loading bar you might be able to get away with a high drive strength since you know it's going to be done in a few frames, but if you display e.g. a text console you might want to reduce drive strength to do as many partial updates as possible before the next full refresh, to reduce flicker.

They basically contain a list of voltage levels a pixel transitioning white-black, white-red etc. should be driven at. The format seems to be standardized across different driver chips, but I'd really treat them as device-dependent binary blobs since for some chips they're not even specified and there's no guarantee the format won't suddenly change for some new chip.

The force_full_refresh thing would be useful to do the periodic (every 10hrs) refresh required by the display's specs without having to re-render the content.

Correct me if I'm wrong, so it sounds like at least the full refresh is
a decision that can and should in the kernel? After all we don't need
an ioctl if it's a trivial "wait 10h, full refresh".

With regards to the other properties, what heuristic are you using to
adjust the parameters? Perhaps it's better to expose the decision itself
to the kernel module?

This way, the kernel can change voltages and perform sanity checks (rate
limit, temperature, etc.) instead of "blindly" damaging the hardware.
