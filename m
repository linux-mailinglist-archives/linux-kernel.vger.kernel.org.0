Yes, this is a command-mode panel and there's no hardware frame counter
available. The key to getting the display working on this phone was this
patch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=2bab52af6fe68c43b327a57e5ce5fc10eefdfadf

I don't think that's happening in this case. I added some pr_info()
statements to request_pp_done_pending() and mdp5_crtc_pp_done_irq().
Here's the first two sets of messages that appear in dmesg:

[   14.018907] msm fd900000.mdss: pp done time out, lm=0
[   14.018993] request_pp_done_pending: HERE
[   14.074208] mdp5_crtc_pp_done_irq: HERE
[   14.074368] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 135x120
[   14.138938] msm fd900000.mdss: pp done time out, lm=0
[   14.139021] request_pp_done_pending: HERE
[   14.158097] mdp5_crtc_pp_done_irq: HERE

The messages go on like this with the same pattern.

I tried two different changes:

1) I moved the request_pp_done_pending() and corresponding if statement
   from mdp5_crtc_atomic_flush() and into mdp5_crtc_atomic_begin().

2) I increased the timeout in wait_for_completion_timeout() by several
   increments; all the way to 5 seconds.

I haven't dug into the new code anymore.
