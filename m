Great! That's what I wanted to know. If it's difficult to find then it
must be easier to use the coreboot tables to find it and it improves
overall speed for the firmware update.

Yes. To be clear I'm not suggesting we make this a binary file design,
although patch 1 is exporting a binary file. I was just wondering why we
couldn't search the flash itself.

>=20

I'd rather we export this information in sysfs via some coreboot_fmap
class and then make the "boot media params" another property of one of
the fmap devices. Then userspace can search through all the fmap devices
and find the "boot media params" one. Is anything else needed?
