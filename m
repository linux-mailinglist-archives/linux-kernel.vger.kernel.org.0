I now also have a new mail, at my new domain OdenixDev.eu. Which we´ll 
see if maybe some more things get installed on the server there. 
Particulary something less macho than text-only mailing list.. ;)

I see Thunderbird  team is asking for donations aswell on their page. 
This is all solved with Odenix Net-Trade Patchclass, fair labour 
compliant, and well-grounded in sound philosophy, and accepted fair 
labour politics, going all the way back to Odenic Intercultural Trade, 
with the same principles.

Peace (Go With Thee).
