Indeed, under rq->lock (some of runqueue locks, I suppose), but 
as far locking order is not violated a thread shouldn't deadlock.
On the other side it could probably hurt concurrency and 
it is more preferable to have task_ctx_data memory pre-allocated 
by the time it is assigned on a context switch in.

What if we would create some pool of preallocated task_ctx_data 
objects on the first system wide perf_event_open() syscall
and after that:
- already existing threads would take task_ctx_data objects from
  the pool without additional locking on the nearest
  context switch in;
- newly created threads would allocate task_ctx_data themselves,
  atomically checking some global state, possibly at PMU object
- task_ctx_data deallocation would be performed by threads
  themselves, at some safe points in time;

Thanks,
Alexey
