By the way, did you see this one which is set to priority 16?

Usually they can run on enough CPUs so a real clash is definitely hard.

I'm trying to collect data on that, if I find something interesting I'll share
it.

I agree. But I don't think an 'admin' is an easily defined entity for all
systems. On mobile, is it the SoC vendor, Android framework, or the
handset/platform vendor/integrator?

In a *real* realtime system I think things are better defined. But usage of RT
tasks on generic systems is the confusing part. There's no real ownership and
things are more ad-hoc.

If you can give me enough pointers to understand the problem I might be able to
bother with it :-)
