I guess the discussion is here because there is a use case to consider now.

For sure, we agree on what is the best solution. But this is rather
about what can we do to improve the current situation, if we should do
anything.

PSCI specifies CPU power management, not SoC power management. If
these things were completely decoupled, I would agree with you, but
that's not the case. Maybe SCMI, etc, helps with this in future.

Anyway, my fear is that not many ARM vendors implements OSI support,
but still they have "last-man-activities" to deal with. This is not
only QCOM.

I guess an option would be to add OSI support to the public ARM
Trusted Firmware, then we could more easily point to that - rather
than trying to mitigate the problem on the kernel side.

Kind regards
Uffe
