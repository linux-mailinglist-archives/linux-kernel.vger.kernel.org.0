Currently CPU or uncore PMUs are supported for PMU event aliasing.

For fully integrated SoCs, we may have many other system PMUs and it is
useful to be able to alias events for those PMUs also. This could also
include the grey area of uncore PMUs, which need to be matched by CPU ID,
so need to be tightly coupled with the CPU. This is how it works for x86.
However, this may not work well for architectures where the CPU may not
have fixed uncore PMUs - ARM arch, for example.

Add support for a new mapfile - mapfile_sys.csv - which maps to system
event tables. For these, some SYS ID is used to match. For CPU PMUs,
mapfile.csv is still used to match any CPU event alises.

Generated pmu-events.c format will be like:

struct pmu_event pme_hisilicon_hip08_cpu[] = {
{
	.name = "l1d_cache_rd",
	.event = "event=0x40",
	.desc = "L1D cache access, read",
	.topic = "core imp def",
	.long_desc = "Attributable Level 1 data cache access, read",
},
{
	.name = "l1d_cache_wr",
	.event = "event=0x41",
	.desc = "L1D cache access, write",
	.topic = "core imp def",
	.long_desc = "Attributable Level 1 data cache access, write",
},
{
	.name = 0,
	.event = 0,
	.desc = 0,
},
};

struct pmu_event pme_hisilicon_hip08_sys[] = {
{
	.name = "uncore_hisi_l3c.rd_cpipe",
	.event = "event=0",
	.desc = "Total read accesses. Unit: hisi_sccl,l3c ",
	.topic = "uncore l3c",
	.long_desc = "Total read accesses",
	.pmu = "hisi_sccl,l3c",
},
{
	.name = "uncore_hisi_l3c.wr_cpipe",
	.event = "event=0x1",
	.desc = "Total write accesses. Unit: hisi_sccl,l3c ",
	.topic = "uncore l3c",
	.long_desc = "Total write accesses",
	.pmu = "hisi_sccl,l3c",
},
{
	.name = 0,
	.event = 0,
	.desc = 0,
},
};

struct pmu_events_map pmu_events_map[] = {
{
	.cpuid = "0x00000000480fd010",
	.version = "v1",
	.type = "core",
	.table = pme_hisilicon_hip08_cpu
},
{
	.sysid = "HIP08",
	.version = "v1",
	.type = "sys",
	.table = pme_hisilicon_hip08_sys
},
{
	.cpuid = 0,
	.sysid = 0,
	.version = 0,
	.type = 0,
	.table = 0,
},
};
