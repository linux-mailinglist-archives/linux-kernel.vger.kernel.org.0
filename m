I wonder if we could actually avoid allocating the data with
ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN in all the cases. It is definitely needed for the
devm_k*alloc() group of functions as they are direct replacement for
k*alloc() APIs that give users aligned memory, but for other data
structures (clocks, regulators, etc, etc) it is not required.

Thanks.
