That is the current plan. So long as there is nothing magical about
either the __GFP_COMP or SetPageReserved, we should be able to drop them
without any functional change. Only 2 very old bits of HW (r128, ancient
i915) depend on this routine, and i915 seems, touch wood, quite happy
with a plain dma_alloc_coherent().
