I'm only really interested in ACPI, TBH.

So just unbinding the driver from a device does not delete the device 
nor exit the device from it's IOMMU group - so we keep the reference to 
the SMMU ko. As such, I don't know how to realistically test unloading 
the SMMU ko when we have platform devices involved. Maybe someone can 
enlighten me...

Thanks,
John
