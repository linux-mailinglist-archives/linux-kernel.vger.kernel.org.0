I am sorry for being dense here but I still do not understand why s390
and the way how it does the hotremove matters here. Afterall there are
no arch specific operations done until the memory is offlined. Also
randomly checking memory blocks and then hoping that the offline will
succeed is not way much different from just trying the offline the
block. Both have to crawl through the pfn range and bail out on the
unmovable memory.
