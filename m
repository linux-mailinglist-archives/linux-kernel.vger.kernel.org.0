There is no "console_lock".  Please be much more specific.

"ease" isn't the main objective.  A more important question is "what
makes sense".  We should be able to call printk() from anywhere, any
time under any conditions.  That can't be done 100% but it is the
objective.  printk() should be robust and not being able to call
printk() while holding zone->lock isn't robust!

btw, this:

: It is unsafe to call printk() while zone->lock was held, i.e.,
:
:	zone->lock --> console_sem

doesn't make a lot of sense.  console_sem is a sleeping lock so
attempting to acquire it (with down()!) under spinlock is a huge bug. 
Again, please be careful with the descriptions.
