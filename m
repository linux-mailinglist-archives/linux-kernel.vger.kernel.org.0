non-presence of 'extcon' doesn't mean the driver need USB Role Switch,
e.g. support manual role switch decided by user, of course, we can check
some cases and then decide whether need USB Role Switch or not, maybe
provide a property will make it easier.

I give manual role switch by sysfs interface a higher priority than
other ways, if manual switch is enabled, e.g. 'extcon' will be ignored.
this may be different from other USB dual-role controller drivers.

Yes, some projects use PMIC or Charger to detect Vbus, but some don't
have Vbus detection circuit, and some even don't provide vbus pin

Yes, it's more related with customer usage, or cost down, anyway, it's
better to support cases as many as possible.
