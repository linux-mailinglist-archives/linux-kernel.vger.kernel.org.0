Imho no. Well, it depends. I can see benefits of both approach. PeterZ's 
patch is quite minimal and it demonstrates itself as a one-off hack quite 
well. On the other hand, it is in a generic code, which is not nice 
especially when other archs do not have such thing. So your proposal would 
indeed make sense to hide it in arch-specific code. Especially for the 
future. And INSN_STACK is not used much in the code, so it can be removed 
easily as you proposed.

And going more in direction of supporting more archs in the future, I'd 
say it would make sense to allow more generic things such as "forget about 
INSN_STACK. If an instruction has non-empty stack_ops list, just process 
it". It is definitely more flexible.

So yes, I think it make sense unless I am missing something.
