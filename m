After I applied this patch set, I found all device names under
'/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cs_etm/sinks/' have been changed as
below on my DB410c board:
# ls /sys/bus/event_source/devices/cs_etm/sinks/
tmc_etf0  tmc_etr0  tpiu0

This leads to below command failure when open PMU device:
# perf record -e cs_etm/@826000.etr/ --per-thread uname
failed to set sink "826000.etr" on event cs_etm/@826000.etr/ with 2 (No such file or directory)

I must use below command so that perf can match string with the
device name under '/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cs_etm/sinks/':
# perf record -e cs_etm/@tmc_etr0/ --per-thread uname

Seems to me, this is an unexpected change and when I worked on the
patch set v2, IIRC that version still can use '826000.etr' to open PMU
device.

Please help confirm for this.  Thanks!

Leo.
