This is more of a long term goal, we can't do it until we have
per-context/process pagetables, ofc.

Getting a bit off topic, but I'm curious about what problems you are
concerned about.  Userspace can shoot it's own foot, but if it is not
sharing GPU pagetables with other processes, it can't shoot other's
feet.  (I'm guessing you are concerned about non-page-aligned
mappings?)

shmem for swappable pages.  I don't unpin and let things get swapped
out yet, but I'm told it starts to become important when you have 50
browser tabs open ;-)

There are some display-only drm drivers with no IOMMU, which use CMA
rather than shmem.  Basically every real GPU has some form of MMU or
IOMMU for memory protection.  (The couple exceptions do expensive
kernel side cmdstream validation.)

(side note, *most* of the drm/msm supported devices are armv8, the
exceptions are 8060 and 8064 which are armv7.. I don't think drm/msm
will ever have to deal w/ armv6)

Userspace keeps the userspace mmap around opportunistically (once it
is mmap'd, not all buffers will be accessed from CPU).  In fact there
is a userspace buffer cache, where we try to re-use buffers that are
already allocated and possibly mmap'd, since allocation and setting up
mmap is expensive.

(There is an MADVISE ioctl so userspace can tell kernel about buffers
in the cache, which are available to be purged by shrinker..  if a
buffer is purged, it's userspace mmap is torn down... along with it's
IOMMU map, ofc)

Before unpinning and allowing pages to be swapped out, CPU and IOMMU
maps would be torn down.  (I don't think we could unpin buffers w/ a
vmap, but those are just a drop in the bucket.)

Currently, the kernel always knows buffers associated w/ a submit
(job) queued to the GPU, so it could bring pages back in and re-store
iommu map.. the fault handler can be used to bring things back in for
CPU access.  (For more free-form HMM style access to userspace memory,
we'd need to be able to sleep in IOMMU fault handler before the IOMMU
resumes translation.)

As far as cache is concerned, it would be basically the same as newly
allocated pages, ie. need to wb+inv the new pages.

Similar to CPU maps, we keep the IOMMU map around as long as possible.

(Side note, I was thinking batching unmaps could be useful to reduce
IOMMU TLB inv overhead.. usually when we are freeing a buffer, we are
freeing multiple, so we could unmap them all, then TLB inv, then free
pages.)
