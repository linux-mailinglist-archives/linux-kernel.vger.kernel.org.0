If you want to supplement the OOM Report and keep the information together =
than
you could use EBPF to do that. If that really is the preference it
might make sense
to put the entire report as an EBPF script than you can modify the
script however
you choose. That would be very flexible. You can change your
configuration on the
fly. As long as it has access to everything you need it should work.

Michal would know what direction OOM is headed and if he thinks that fits w=
ith
where things are headed.

I'm flexible in he sense that I could change our submission to make
specific updates
to the existing OOM code. We kept it as separate as possible as for
ease of porting.
But if we can build an acceptable case for making updates to the existing O=
OM
Report code that works.

Our current implementation has some knobs to allow some limited scaling tha=
t
has advantages over print rate limiting and it may allow environments
that didn't
want to allow process printing or slab or vmalloc entry allocations
printing to do
so without generating a lot of output.

But the existing code could be modified to do the same thing. Possibly with=
out
having a configuration interface if that is not desirable. It could look at
the number entries to potentially print for example and if the number
is small it
could print them all or scale selection based on a default memory usage. Do=
 you
really care about slab or vmalloc entries using 1 MB or less of memory on a
256 GB system for example? Probably not. Our approach let's you size this
and has a default that may be reasonable for many environments. But it allo=
ws
you to configure things which adds some complexity.

Now you could in theory produce the entire OOM Report plus anything we've
purposed with an EBPF script. Haven't done it but assume it works with 5.3.
Problem with any type of plugin and or configurable option is testing as
Michal mentions and the fact it may or not be present.

For production systems installing and updating EBPF scripts may someday
be very common, but I wonder how data center managers feel about it now?
Developers are very excited about it and it is a very powerful tool but can=
 I
get permission to add or replace an existing EBPF on production systems?
If there is reluctance for security or reliability or any issue than I
would rather
have the code in the kernel so I know it is there and is tested. Just as I =
would
prefer not to have the config options for reasons Michal cites, but
I'll take that
if that is the best I can get.

Will be interested to hear what Michal advises.
