Well, that's not quite true because we do store full long there. You're
right that we do that with cmpxchg() and modify only some bits in that word
but that may be too difficult for the sanitizer to find out.

So in this particular case, store tearing is non-issue because we use
atomic operation to store the value in page_cpupid_xchg_last(). I think it
would make some sense to use READ_ONCE(page->flags) here to prevent
compiler from loading page->flags several times - I have hard time finding
a reason why a compiler would want to do that but conceptually that
protection makes sense, it is for free performance wise, and will still
allow KCSAN to find a race in case we ever grow a place that modifies
page's zone non-atomically (which might be a real problem). And it should
also silence the KCSAN warning AFAIU.
