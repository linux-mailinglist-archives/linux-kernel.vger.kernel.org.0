This reminds me my recent series of patches.

Could you use synth_event_run_command() for this purpose as I did
in boot-time tracing series?

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/157528179955.22451.16317363776831311868.stgit@devnote2

Above example uses a command string as same as command string, but I think
we can introduce some macros to construct the command string for easier
definition.

Or maybe it is possible to pass the const char *args[] array to that API,
instead of single char *cmd. (for dynamic event definiton)

Maybe we should consider more generic APIs for modules to create/delete
dynamic-event including synthetic and probes, and those might reuse
existing command parsers.

Could you also check the locks are correctly acquired? It seems that
your APIs doesn't lock it.


Thank you,
