The idea here is to keep the struct dma_heap as an opaque pointer for
everyone but the core framework. No one should be touching the guts of
that struct (would be 'private' if we were using C++ but this is the
best we can do with C), exposing it to the exporters or the importers
will break this isolation.

This export style also matches DMA-BUF: you pass in a filled out _export
struct and it passes back a dma_buf handle. DMA-BUF unfortunately made
the internals of that struct public so they are widely used directly
(and abused in some cases) and that prevents the internals from being
easily refactored when needed.
