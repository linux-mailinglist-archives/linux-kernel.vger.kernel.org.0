Hi Tudor,

thanks for looking into this.

Yes but that was the whole idea of this patch. So if I get you correct 
it is
not possible to change that even if:

(1) it was never intended that way. Eg. the original patch(es) were 
about
removing the volatile write protection (which makes perfectly sense, 
even
during probe time) to be able to write to the flash. But it was never 
intended
to disable the non-volatile write protection.

(2) it might be even harmful. It is still an open question wether the 
write
to the non-volatile bits (even if it is the same value) might wear them 
out.
Unfortunately our FAE didn't answered yet..

(3) it makes the write protection utterly useless, because if you lock 
the
flash it will be automatically unlocked after the next reboot. Even 
worse, the
user likely won't notice it.

I'd also prefer a solution for all existing flashes. But it seems that 
the rule
above makes that almost impossible. Esp. this behaviour will then be 
there until
eternity.

Still my preferred way. but also see below. But I wouldn't say it 
configures the
flash but describe that the user want to use the write protection.

Mhh. If we would combine this with this patch that would be at least a 
step into
the right direction. At least a distro could enable that kernel option 
without
breaking old boards/flashes. Because as outlined about you need that for 
flashes
in category (2). Or you'd have to do a flash_unlock every time you want 
to write
to it. But that would be really a backwards incompatible change.. ;)
