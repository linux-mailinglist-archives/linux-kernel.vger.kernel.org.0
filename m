It looks like some debugging is in order.  There must be some sort of
action initiated by userspace which is causing the multicast
"op=connect", right?  Find out what that is and why it isn't
generating a syscall record (maybe it's not a syscall? I don't know
what systemd is doing here).

You mentioned two cases: unmonitored syscalls and async records (I
assumed these were just "disconnect").  Monitoring a syscall is a
configuration choice, regardless of what the defaults may be, and
since the folks likely to care about these multicast events are the
same sort of folks that care deeply about audit, asking them to do
some additional configuration tweaks seems like a reasonable thing to
get this new record with the proper information.  The async records
are potentially more interesting, but less clear, which is why I asked
for more info.

Regardless, all of this is pretty moot if we decide we don't care
about duplicate information.  Let's make a decision on duplicate
fields across multiple records before we worry too much about the rest
of what we are discussing.

Oh man, let's please not have *another* debate about field ordering
before we answer the duplicate field question.  If history has shown
us anything, it is that debates around audit record field ordering
tend to kill progress.  Let's try to stay focused.
