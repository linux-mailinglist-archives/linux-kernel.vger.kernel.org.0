Well… systems cloud-init adapts may come from the same template. Cloud 
Init thus replaces the key that has been there before on their first 
boot. There is no "installation".

Cloud Init could replace the key in the background… and restart SSH 
then… but that will give those big fat man in the middle warnings and 
all systems would use the same SSH host key initially. I just don't see 
a good way at the moment how to handle this. Introducing an SSH mode for 
this is still a temporary not so random key with proper warnings might 
be challenging to get right from both a security and usability point of 
view. And it would add complexity.

That said with Proxmox VE on Fujitsu S8 or Intel NUCs I have never seen 
this issue even when starting 50 VMs in a row, however, with large cloud 
providers starting 50 VMs in a row does not sound like all that much. 
And I bet with Proxmox VE virtio rng is easily available cause it uses 
KVM.
