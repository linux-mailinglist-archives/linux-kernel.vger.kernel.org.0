So like this?

@@ -10248,7 +10248,8 @@ static void set_curr_task_fair(struct rq *rq)

        set_next_entity(cfs_rq, se);
        /* ensure bandwidth has been allocated on our new cfs_rq */

I fail to understand the second part of your sentence, and
how is this related to the code in propagate_exec_runtime():

for_each_sched_entity(se) {

    propagate_exec_runtime() {

        if (parent)
            account_cfs_rq_runtime(cfs_rq, diff);
    }
}

Maybe this all will become clearer when the reworked CFS Bandwidth
support is ready ;-) I see this patch as the first part of it.
