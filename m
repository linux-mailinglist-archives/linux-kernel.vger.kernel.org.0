For z3fold, the data can be found here:
https://elinux.org/images/d/d3/Z3fold.pdf.

For zbud (which is also of interest), imagine a low-end platform with
a simplistic HW compressor that doesn't give really high ratio. We
still want to be able to use ZRAM (not necessarily as a swap
partition, but rather for /home and /var) but we absolutely don't need
zsmalloc's complexity. zbud is a perfect match here (provided that it
can cope with PAGE_SIZE pages, yes, but it's a small patch to make
that work) since it's unlikely that we squeeze more than 2 compressed
pages per page with that HW compressor anyway.

I have hard time seeing how maintenance cost is increased here :)
