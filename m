Ugh, really?  After 23 versions of this patchset no one saw this?

The old kernel documentation used to say I was allowed to make fun of
people who did this, but that was removed as it really wasn't that nice.

But I'm seriously reconsidering that at the moment.

No, this is NOT OK!

Think about what you are doing here, and why you feel that it is ok to
work around a kernel message that was added there explicitly to help you
do things the right way.  I didn't add it just because I felt like it, I
was trying to give you a chance to not get the use of this api
incorrect.

That failed :(

Ugh, not ok.  Seriously, not ok...

Why do you even need a struct device in the first place?

Why a whole cdev?

Why not use a misc device?  YOu only have 2 devices right?  Why not 2
misc devices then?  That saves the use of a whole major number and makes
your code a _LOT_ simpler.

I'm afraid to look at this bus code.

Instead I'm going to ask, why do you need a bus at all?  What drivers do
you have for this bus?

ugh I don't know why I looked at this code, but it's not ok as-is and
anyone who reviewed the driver model interaction needs to rethink
things...
