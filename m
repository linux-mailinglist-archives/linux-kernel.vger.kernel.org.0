Thank you for the specific examples and explanations. I need to frame
your email and hang it next to my monitor for reference.

Do you really mean "code" or are you just referring to "code comments"?
If you really mean code, then I'd appreciate some feedback about what
should change.

Your private email helped me a great deal. The memory barrier work in v2
is vastly superior to v1, even if it still crap in your eyes. I
appreciate you continuing to support me on this.
