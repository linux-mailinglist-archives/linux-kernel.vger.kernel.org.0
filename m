Another Ok, please send a formal patch, and it would be really nice if
the other ARM folks would... Ack that ;-) :-) And provide extra entries
for the other pmu-events directories or even for specific files, which
is a possibility, right?

On my side I'll script a bit more and make sure that a post commit hook
warns me if the right tag is not present.
