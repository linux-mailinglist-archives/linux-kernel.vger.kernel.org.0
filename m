Ok. So this looks big, we this hasn't been prototyped, so we don't have
a concrete idea. I agree that concurrency is likely to be painful. :)

I think it's been an implicit assumption for so long that no-one saw the need
for built-time assertions where they depend on it. 

I also suspect that in practice there are paths that you won't have
stressed in your environment, e.g. in the ACPI wakeup path where we end
up calling:

/* Unpoison the stack for the current task beyond a watermark sp value. */
asmlinkage void kasan_unpoison_task_stack_below(const void *watermark)
{
	/*
	 * Calculate the task stack base address.  Avoid using 'current'
	 * because this function is called by early resume code which hasn't
	 * yet set up the percpu register (%gs).
	 */
	void *base = (void *)((unsigned long)watermark & ~(THREAD_SIZE - 1));

	kasan_unpoison_shadow(base, watermark - base);
}

Generally, I think that those can be fixed up. Someone just needs to dig
through how THREAD_SIZE and THREAD_SIZE_ORDER are used to generate or
manipulate addresses.

For local-task stuff, I think it's easy to rewrite in terms of
task_stack_page(), but I'm not entirely sure what we'd do for cases
where we look at another task, e.g.

static int proc_stack_depth(struct seq_file *m, struct pid_namespace *ns, 
                                struct pid *pid, struct task_struct *task)
{
        unsigned long prev_depth = THREAD_SIZE -
                                (task->prev_lowest_stack & (THREAD_SIZE - 1)); 
        unsigned long depth = THREAD_SIZE -
                                (task->lowest_stack & (THREAD_SIZE - 1)); 

        seq_printf(m, "previous stack depth: %lu\nstack depth: %lu\n",
                                                        prev_depth, depth);
        return 0;
}

... as I'm not sure of the lifetime of task->stack relative to task. I
know that with THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK the stack can be freed while the task
is still live.

Thanks,
Mark.
