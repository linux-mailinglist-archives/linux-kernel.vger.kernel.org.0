OK, could you tell me your idea to make it better? I'm waiting for such
discussion a half of last year :)

For your information, here is the background of this bootconfig.
To build my boot-time tracing, I need a way to pass a flexible and
structured configuration at boot time.
I had tried to reuse devicetree at first, but it was rejected because
the devicetree is only for describing hardware. So I introduced this
bootconfig.
When I designed the bootconfig, I tried to sort out the requirements.
That config should be able to pass all setting we can do on tracefs.
Since ftrace already has a parser for tracefs, we don't need any types
for each settings. Thus it should be something like sysctl.conf. But the
sysctl.conf was too simple, it couldn't handle several related keys
well. So I decided to introduce braces which put together some related
parameters. And the bootconfig syntax was born.

I see that current piggyback method might look a bit odd. My first
implementation was bootloader based method (I implemented it on grub and
qemu), but that was not useful, especially it required user to replace
their bootloader...

Okay, I hope it and try to prove it. Anyway, to use boot-time tracing which
can fully utilize ftrace at boot-time, we have to enable bootconfig.

Thank you,
