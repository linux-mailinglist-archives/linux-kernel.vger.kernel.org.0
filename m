The legacy binding is the special case, though. Isn't it perfectly 
logical to check for the special case, and assume the normal case 
otherwise? ;)

FWIW that was a deliberate design decision. We didn't want to see DTs 
with both bindings at once - the legacy binding support remains only for 
the sake of DTBs deployed in fossilised firmware that can't/won't ever 
be updated. And I'm pretty sure the intervening 3 years have only 
reinforced that position. Only a couple more months now until it will 
have been deprecated for longer than it wasn't :)

Do note that "mmu-masters" isn't just deprecated for giggles either - 
the binding made some flawed assumptions, and there are Stream ID 
topologies that it cannot possibly describe, which do exist in the real 
world.

Fair enough, but conversely, what makes it Linux's responsibility to 
handle? If Xen wants to deal with funky hybrid DTs then why shouldn't it 
be Xen's job to just filter deprecated properties out of whatever it 
presents to Linux?
