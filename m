Subject: [PATCH] doc:lock: remove reference to clever use of read-write lock
Date:   Sat, 31 Aug 2019 15:41:16 +0200

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Remove the clever example about read-write lock because these type of
lock is not reccomended anymore (according to the very same document).
So there is no reason to teach cleaver things that people should not do.

(and by the way there was a little typo)
