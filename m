Ah, yes. Agreed!

Sorry I made a typo, I meant 'tick active when CPU is non-idle for NOHZ_IDLE
systems' above.

But even if we're in kernel mode and not transitioning, I thought the FQS
loop (rcu_implicit_dynticks_qs() function) would set need_heavy_qs to true at
2 * jiffies_to_sched_qs.

Hmm, I forgot that jiffies_to_sched_qs can be quite large I guess. You're
right, we could call rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle() in advance before waiting
for FQS loop to do the setting of need_heavy_qs.

Or, am I missing something with the rcu_momentary_dyntick_idle() point you
made?
