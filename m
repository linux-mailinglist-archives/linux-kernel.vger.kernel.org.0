I really don't see the point of separating out all but one line into a
different function.  You might as well just rename 
usb_amd_find_chipset_info to usb_amd_quirk_pll_check (along with the 
other code adjustments) and be done with it.

However, in the end I don't care if you still want to do this.  Either 
way:
