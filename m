Hi Mark,

There is no such thing as a GICv4 register. All registers exist on all
versions of the architecture. They all have a well defined behaviour
when not implemented, which is RAZ/WI. New versions of the GICv3
architecture (which continues to evolve in parallel to GICv4) may use
this register as well, and this patch would then become a problem on
its own.

Now, to the issue itself:

I have reported this exact problem back in October:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191027144234.8395-1-maz@kernel.org/

and proposed a patch for it:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191027144234.8395-11-maz@kernel.org/

I've been repeatedly asking for Marvell/Cavium to come up with a
description of the issue so that we know the extent of the problem. So
far, all I've heard is the sound of crickets, which confirm my
impression that this HW is dead to its manufacturer and that they don't
want to support it. I'm not asking much though: just tell me what is
wrong (again!) with this CPU, which are the affected revisions, what is
the errata number and I'll deal with it.

I can't get that information. Can you?

I'm now proposing that we fully remove support for TX1 from the
mainline kernel, because every single bit of this CPU is completely
busted. Just look at the number of workarounds we have to carry around.
Without involvement from Marvell, this CPU is a liability for the rest
of the arm64 kernel (just look at what we have to do to enable KPTI
*because of TX1*, the amount of crap I added to KVM to fully emulate
the broken CPU interface, and plenty of other things).

I intend to propose such removal once 5.7-rc1 lands.

Thanks,

	M.
