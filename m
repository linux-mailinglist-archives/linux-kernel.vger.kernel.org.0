Yes, sorry I mistead this.  The way is is defined is rather
non-intuitive, but actually backwards compatible.

I think we actually need to fix the spec instead, even if it just the
naming and not the mechanism.

The getchar/putchar calls unfortunately are fundamentally flawed, as
they mean the sbi can still access the console after the host has taken
it over using its own drivers.  Which will lead to bugs sooner or later.

And if you can bring up a console driver in opensbi it should be just
as trivial to bring up the kernel version.
