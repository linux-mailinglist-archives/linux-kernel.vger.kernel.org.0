Hi Cristian,

This looks very robust and general but I'm wondering about the
"notification -> user" latency.  It appears there are at least five or
so memcpy()s of the notification message as it works its way to the
user, and added to that is the work queue deferral latency.  Is there
a concern on your end for low latency notifications, perhaps for
emergency notifications or do you consider this to be quick enough?

Note that we (BrcmSTB) have implemented our own  SCMI notification
system for a proprietary protocol and we designed it to deliver
notifications as quickly as possible.  Our system is more or less a
disposable hack and would not stand up to heavy or general usage.  We
fully intend to move to the approved Linux notification system.  On
that note,  I'm just wondering if you had any comment on the
possibility of  "slimming down" your RFC, e.g. perhaps somehow
collapsing some memcpy()s.

Thanks,
Jim
PS I'm going on vacation so I won't be able to email for a week.
