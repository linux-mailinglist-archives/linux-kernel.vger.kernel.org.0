We are using the "kernel.org account" as a way to verify that you really
are part of our developer/maintainer community and that you are part of
the "web of trust" and an actual person.

That is the goal here, if you know of some other way to determine this,
please let us know.  We went through many iterations of this and at the
moment, it is the best we can come up with.

Also, note that the "kernel.org admin" is really a team of people who
have been doing this for 9 years, it's not a single person responsible
for giving out new accounts to people that do not meet the obvious
requirement levels as published on kernel.org

That is exactly what we want.

Yes, we know that, but it does mean that you are "known" to someone
else, which is the key here.

What is not transparent about how to get a kernel.org account?

We are not saying it is "problem free", but what really is the problem
with it?
