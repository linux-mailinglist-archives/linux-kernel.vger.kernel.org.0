Well, my guess was wrong.  ;-)

This is instead rcutorture being surprised by the fact that RCU grace
periods are expedited during the hibernate process.  I could fix this
particular situation, but I bet that there are a number of others,
including my guess above.

One approach would be to halt rcutorture testing just before hibernating
and restart it just after resuming.

Thoughts?
