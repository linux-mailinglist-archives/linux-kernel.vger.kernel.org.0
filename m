Oh, Ok. Not sure about BCC. I know that facebook folks are using *existing*
tracepoints (not trace events) to probe context switches and such (probably
not through BCC but some other BPF tracing code). Peter had rejected trace
events they were trying to add IIRC, so they added BPF_RAW_TRACEPOINT_OPEN
then IIRC.

Yeah this is a bit of a mess. I think for every recent LPC this has come up.
But the DECLARE_TRACE approach you did is interesting in that it
reduces/removes the API surface for trace-events at least.
