Not exactly, but that is far and away the most likely explanation for
the device's behavior.  We tried making a bunch of changes, some of
which helped a little bit, but all of them left a very large
performance gap.  I/O monitoring showed that the only noticeable
difference in the kernel-device interaction caused by the $SUBJECT
commit was the non-sequential access pattern.

Andrea has tested only the write behavior.  Possibly reading will be
affected too, but my guess is that it won't be.

It seems reasonable that the access pattern could make a significant
difference.  The device's behavior suggests that it buffers incoming
data and pauses from time to time to write the accumulated data into
non-volatile storage.  If its algorithm for allocating, erasing, and
writing data blocks is optimized for the sequential case, you can
easily imagine that non-sequential accesses would cause it to pause
more often and for longer times -- which is exactly what we observed.
These extra pauses are what resulted in the overall performance 
decrease.

So far we have had no way to perform a direct test.  That is, we don't
know of any setting that would change a single kernel between
sequential and non-sequential access.  If you can suggest a simple way
to force a kernel without the $SUBJECT commit to do non-sequential
writes, I'm sure Andrea will be happy to try it out and see if it
causes a slowdown.

Please spell out the exact procedure in detail so that Andrea can try 
it.  He's not a kernel hacker, and I know very little about the block 
layer.
