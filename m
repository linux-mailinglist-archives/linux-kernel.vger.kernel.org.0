Hi Bhupesh,

(stepping back a bit:)

I'm against exposing arch-specific #ifdefs that correspond to how we've configured the
arch code's interactions with mm. These are all moving targets, we can't have any of it
become ABI.

I have a straw-man for this: What is the value of PTE_FILE_MAX_BITS on your system?
I have no idea what this value is or means, an afternoon's archaeology would be needed(!).
This is something that made sense for one kernel version, a better idea came along, and it
was replaced. If we'd exposed this to user-space, we'd have to generate a value, even if
it doesn't mean anything. Exposing VA_BITS_ACTUAL is the same.

(Keep an eye out for when we change the kernel memory map, and any second-guessing based
on VA_BITS turns out to be wrong)


What we do have are the hardware properties. The kernel can't change these.

cpufeature won't help you if you've already panic()d and only have the vmcore file. This
stuff needs to go in vmcoreinfo.

As long as there is a description of how userspace uses these values, I think adding
key/values for TCR_EL1.TxSZ to the vmcoreinfo is a sensible way out of this. You probably
need TTBR1_EL1.BADDR too. (it should be specific fields, to prevent 'new uses' becoming ABI)

This tells you how the hardware was configured, and covers any combination of TxSZ tricks
we play, and whether those address bits are used for VA, or ptrauth for TTBR0 or TTRB1.
