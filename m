Oh, I don't have a CephFS setup. Will you use the
scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh to find what line number is the offending
statement? That will help in figuring out what has gone wrong.

Anyway, it seems like a structure that include a rwsem is freed while
another cpu is still waiting to acquire the lock. It is probably a
hidden bug in the filesystem code somewhere that the recent changes in
rwsem behavior make it easier for  the problem to show up.

Cheers,
