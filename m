Definitely not very intuitive.. but yes I think it is a reasonable
tradeoff between your goals and further code complexity to be able to
achieve the "ideal".

Think the documented example can be made clearer by documenting that
dm_bufio_cache_size_per_client = 49.  And that _that_ is the reason why
the client that didn't set a maximum is bounded to 49.

Overall I think this patch looks reasonable, but I'd like Mikulas to
review this closer before I pick it up.

Thanks,
Mike
