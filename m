Once the core kcsan bits are ready, I'll rebase the arm64 patch atop.
I'm expecting some things to change as part of review, so it'd be great
to see that posted ASAP.

For arm64 I'm not expecting major changes (other than those necessary to
handle the arm64 atomic rework that went in to v5.4-rc1)

FWIW, I was able to run Syzkaller atop of my arm64/kcsan branch, but
it's very noisy as it has none of the core fixes.

Thanks,
Mark.
