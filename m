Since this patch is in linux-next, roughly 10% of my x86 and x86_64
qemu emulation boots are stalling. Typical log:

[    0.002016] smpboot: Total of 1 processors activated (7576.40 BogoMIPS)
[    0.002016] devtmpfs: initialized
[    0.002016] clocksource: jiffies: mask: 0xffffffff max_cycles: 0xffffffff, max_idle_ns: 1911260446275000 ns
[    0.002016] futex hash table entries: 256 (order: 3, 32768 bytes, linear)
[    0.002016] xor: measuring software checksum speed

another:

[    0.002653] Freeing SMP alternatives memory: 44K
[    0.002653] smpboot: CPU0: Intel Westmere E56xx/L56xx/X56xx (IBRS update) (family: 0x6, model: 0x2c, stepping: 0x1)
[    0.002653] Performance Events: unsupported p6 CPU model 44 no PMU driver, software events only.
[    0.002653] rcu: Hierarchical SRCU implementation.
[    0.002653] smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...
[    0.002653] x86: Booting SMP configuration:
[    0.002653] .... node  #0, CPUs:      #1
[    0.000000] smpboot: CPU 1 Converting physical 0 to logical die 1

... and then there is silence until the test aborts.

This is only (or at least predominantly) seen if the system running
the emulation is under load.

Reverting this patch fixes the problem.
