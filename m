Friends have disagreements. We remain friends and I will provide a v2.

I still believe it makes no sense to split the integration of 
SoundWire-related patches in two different trees. The only rationale for 
it might be that SoundWire is a 'bus' than could be used in other areas. 
Except that for now and the foreseeable future (2022+) it's only for 
audio as a replacement of HDaudio, so the pragmatic way of dealing with 
SoundWire is to merge the code through the audio tree. And given that 
the code is not in a usable state at the moment, dealing with the audio 
tree would not have any negative impact on anyone.
