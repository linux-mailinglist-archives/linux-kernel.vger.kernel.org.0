Indeed. Same thing applies for hot-removing the AArch32-capable CPUs,
by the way. You'd end-up in a situation where guests can't run, despite
the initial contract that we're happy that configuration.

Probably. There are bizarre overlaps, in the sense that some
capabilities (such as this AArch32 EL1 support) are firmly kernel
related, and yet have a direct impact on userspace. KVM blurs the lines
in "interesting" ways... :-(.
