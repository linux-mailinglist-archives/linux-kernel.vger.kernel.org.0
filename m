I find this email extremely amusing. Just the day before (Thursday), I
was trying to clean out my INBOX (it had emails back from 2008!) and I
came across this very thread, and said to myself. "Hmm, I wonder if I
should push this again?". What a coincidence that the next day, someone
would email me about that thread after 9 years!

That's because it was dropped and forgotten about :-(  I left it in my
INBOX to remind myself to bring it back, but that didn't work out as
well as I expected, as my INBOX turned into more of a graveyard than a
TODO list.

I'm unfamiliar with "-m", what does that do?

Well, obviously (as you state below), that's not an answer.

I think your email confirmed to me that I need to push this thread
again.

Thanks for reaching out!
