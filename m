To be honest I've no idea what different SoC designs have done, but one
of the intentions of core stacks was that sets of GPU cores would be on
different power supplies. (I think this is to avoid issues with inrush
current etc, but I'm not a hardware engineer). So I would expect designs
with a large number of cores to have more physical supplies than designs
with fewer cores.

However, from a driver perspective this is all meant to be hidden by the
hardware PDC which the GPU talks to. So the actual power up/down of the
supplies may be completely automatic and therefore not described in the
DT. So the actual number of software-controllable supplies could be 1 or
could be more if the individual physical supplies are visible to software.

The Hikey960 for instance hides everything behind a mailbox interface,
and it's simply a case of requesting a frequency.
