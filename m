I get that, but at the same time I am not sure if everyone will be
happy with the trade-off. That is my concern.

You may want to change the patch description above if that is the
case. Based on the description above it makes it sound as if the issue
is that QEMU is using hole punch or MADV_DONTNEED with the wrong
granularity. Based on your comment here it sounds like you want to
have the ability to break up the larger THP page as soon as you want
to push out a single 4K page from it.

I am not sure the description for the behavior of anonymous THP with
respect to QEMU makes sense either. Based on the description you made
it sound like it was somehow using the same process used for huge
pages. That isn't the case right? My understanding is that in the case
of an anonymous THP it is getting broken into 4K subpages and then
those are freed individually. That should leave you with the same
performance regression that I had brought up earlier.

So if anything it sounds like what you are really wanting is feature
parity with anonymous THP which will split the anonymous THP page when
a single 4K page within the THP is hit with MADV_DONTNEED.
