FROM MR.ABDERAZACK ZEBDANI
 AUDIT& ACCOUNT MANAGER
 BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
 OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO
 WEST AFRICA.

 Dear Friend,

 With due respect, I have decided to contact you on
 abusinesstransaction that will be beneficial to both of us. At the
 bank last account and auditing evaluation, my staffs came across an
 old account which was being maintained by a foreign client who we
 learn was among the deceased passengers of motor accident on
 November.2003, the deceased was unable to run this account since his
 death. Theaccount has remained dormant without the knowledge of his
 family since it was put in a safe deposit account in the bank for
 future investment by the client.

 Since his demise, even the members of his family haven't applied for
 claims over this fund and it has been in the safe deposit account
 until I discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client
 isaforeign national and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to
 file claims over the money. As the director of the department, this
 discovery was brought to my office so as to decide what is to bedone.I
 decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out of the
 bank and out of the country too.

 The total amount in the account is 18.6 million with my positions as
staffs of the bank, I am handicapped because I cannot operate foreign
 accounts and cannot lay bonafide claim over this money. The client was
 a foreign national and you will only be asked to act as his next of
 kin and I will supply you with all the necessary information and bank
 data to assist you in being able to transfer this money to any bank of
 your choice where this money could be transferred into.The total sum
 will be shared as follows: 50% for me, 50% for you and expenses
 incidental occur during the transfer will be incur by both of us. The
 transfer is risk free on both sides hence you are going to follow my
 instruction till the fund transfer to your account. Since I work in
 this bank that is why you should be confident in the success of this
 transaction because you will be updated with information as at when
 desired.

 I will wish you to keep this transaction secret and confidential as I
 am hoping to retire with my share of this money at the end of
 transaction which will be when this money is safety in your account. I
 will then come over to your country for sharing according to the
 previously agreed percentages. You might even have to advise me on
 possibilities of investment in your country or elsewhere of our
 choice. May God help you to help me to a restive retirement, Amen,And
 You have to contact me through my private e-mail at
 (mr.abderazackzebdani14@gmail.com )Please for further information and
 inquires feel free to contact me back immediately for more explanation
 and better understanding I want you to assure me your capability of
 handling this project with trust by providing me your following
 information details such as:

 (1)NAME..............
 (2)AGE:................
 (3)SEX:.....................
 (4)PHONE NUMBER:.................
 (5)OCCUPATION:.....................
 (6)YOUR COUNTRY:.....................

 Yours sincerely,
 Mr. Abderazack Zebdani
