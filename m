+Device Naming scheme
+------------------------
+The devices that appear on the "coresight" bus were named the same as their
+parent devices, i.e, the real devices that appears on AMBA bus or the platform bus.
+Thus the names were based on the Linux Open Firmware layer naming convention,
+which follows the base physical address of the device followed by the device
+type. e.g:
+
+root:~# ls /sys/bus/coresight/devices/
+ 20010000.etf  20040000.funnel      20100000.stm     22040000.etm
+ 22140000.etm  230c0000.funnel      23240000.etm     20030000.tpiu
+ 20070000.etr  20120000.replicator  220c0000.funnel
+ 23040000.etm  23140000.etm         23340000.etm
+
+However, with the introduction of ACPI support, the names of the real
+devices are a bit cryptic and non-obvious. Thus, a new naming scheme was
+introduced to use more generic names based on the type of the device. The
+following rules apply:
+
+  1) Devices that are bound to CPUs, are named based on the CPU logical
+     number.
+
+     e.g, ETM bound to CPU0 is named "etm0"
+
+  2) All other devices follow a pattern, "<device_type_prefix>N", where :
+
+	<device_type_prefix> 	- A prefix specific to the type of the device
+	N			- a sequential number assigned based on the order
+				  of probing.
+
+	e.g, tmc_etf0, tmc_etr0, funnel0, funnel1
+
+Thus, with the new scheme the devices could appear as :
+
+root:~# ls /sys/bus/coresight/devices/
+ etm0     etm1     etm2         etm3  etm4      etm5      funnel0
+ funnel1  funnel2  replicator0  stm0  tmc_etf0  tmc_etr0  tpiu0
+
+Some of the examples below might refer to old naming scheme and some
+to the newer scheme, to give a confirmation that what you see on your
+system is not unexpected. One must use the "names" as they appear on
+the system under specified locations.
