I was really just looking for some intuition as to how this event is
currently used and why extending it like this is unlikely to break those
existing users.

Perhaps, although given that proc_comm_connector() is currently only called
on the prctl() path, then it does at least provide the comm from the most
recent prctl() invocation. With your path, the calls can go out of order,
so I think that probably needs fixing.
