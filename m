I'm still trying to figure out what you meant
by your suggestion to implement a modify_ftrace_direct().
I was thinking something much simpler like
modify_ftrace_direct(ip, old_call, new_ca);
will just text poke that call addr from old to new if old matches
and will adjust ftrace inner bookkeeping.
I don't understand why you want to malloc/free ftrace_ops for that.
