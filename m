Provided we do the suggestion below (setting gamma_size and enabling
color management) when lut_regs is set, then I think we are fine.

Before this change:

* GAMMA_LUT property doesn't exist, and so can't be set.
* DRM_IOCTL_MODE_SETGAMMA (legacy) return ENOSYS.

After this change, on platforms that doesn't support this:

* GAMMA_LUT property doesn't exist, and so can't be set.
* DRM_IOCTL_MODE_SETGAMMA (legacy) return EINVAL.

The only difference is the ENOSYS/EINVAL errno, which I doubt
will regress anything.

I don't think this difference deserves assigning (the legacy)
.gamma_set hook conditionally, which would make the
implementation too ugly.

Yes, totally. See above.

Yes.

Thanks a lot for the review,
