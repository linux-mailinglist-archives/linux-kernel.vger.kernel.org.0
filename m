That's probably because without proper kernel changes this is rather
tricky to use safely (see below).

This is work that is ongoing and requires kernel changes to make it
feasible. One of the things that I have been working on for quite a
while is the whole file descriptor for processes thing that is important
for LMKD (Even though I never thought about this use-case when I started
pitching this.). Joel and Daniel have joined in and are working on
making LMKD possible.
What I find odd is that every couple of weeks different solutions to the
low memory problem are pitched. There is simple_lkml, there is LMKD, and
there was a patchset that wanted to speed up memory reclaim at process
kill-time by adding a new flag to the new pidfd_send_signal() syscall.
That all seems - though related - rather uncoordinated. Now granted,
coordinated is usually not how kernel development necessarily works but
it would probably be good to have some sort of direction and from what I
have seen LMKD seems to be the most coordinated effort. But that might
just be my impression.
