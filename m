Correct, I am revisiting this and I think I have a fair idea of
expectations here (looking at usb and greybus model), will hack
something up

So the idea here would be to go back and create a sdw_master device and
use that in the bus instance. I think it should be doable..

Sorry my fault, I should have fixed it back then.

Not really we have object here which should contain a real device for
master and need plumbing for it..

yes that is my thinking as well. We still need to link to
platform/pci/whatever device you have and grab a refcount to that one.
