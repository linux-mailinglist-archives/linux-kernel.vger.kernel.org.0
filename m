(There was some discussion about this over-estimate on the list, but it didn't make it
into the commit message.) I think a reserved->free change is fine. If user-space thinks
its still reserved nothing bad happens.

What error message?

These second-level reserved regions are to avoid kexec overwriting ACPI tables, or bits of
the UEFI memory map with its data.

The second kernel should not expect to find the initramfs here...

I agree we should fix this. Could it be done as a separate patch, as this is a different
issue?

Could we do this last? This calls __free_pages(), once we've done that it could be
allocated somewhere else, but memblock and iomem still say this is reserved memory.

("if (res)" is the preferred style)

Hmm, I can't see where __release_region() splits start/end out of an existing resource...

I think this means if you have memblock_reserved() pages either size of the initramfs they
get merged by memblock and put into iomem_resource as one entry. We'd hit
__release_regions()s:
|		if (res->start != start || res->end != end)
|			break;
[...]
|	printk(KERN_WARNING "Trying to free nonexistent resource "
|		"<%016llx-%016llx>\n", (unsigned long long)start,
|		(unsigned long long)end);

It looks like __release_region() is only for exactly the region you reserved. We need it
to split one resource into two, the reverse of what reserve_region_with_split() does.

I can't see a helper that would do this.


An alternative is to explicitly create an iomem_resource for the initramfs, like we do for
the kernel text/data. reserve_region_with_split() will then fill in the gaps around it if
there are any, and you can pass it to release_resource() in here instead of searching for it.

It should be possible to test by rounding the initramfs base/size in arm64_memblock_init()
by a bit more.


Thanks,

James
