Hi,
Please do.

There have been around 10 changes in fs/eventpoll.c since v5.0 was
released in March, 2019, so it would be helpful if you could test
the latest mainline kernel to see if the problem is still present.

Hm, it looks like you have identified this commit:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?h=v5.1-rc5&id=c5a282e9635e9c7382821565083db5d260085e3e
as the/a problem.

I have Cc-ed the patch author also.
