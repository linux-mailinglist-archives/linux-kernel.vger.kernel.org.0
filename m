A userspace process could just poll on the kernel by forking a process 
to use getrandom() and waiting until it does not get terminated anymore. 
And then it would still hang.

So yes, that would it make it harder to abuse the API, but not 
impossible. Which may still be good, I don't know.

Either the kernel does not reveal at all whether it has seeded CRNG and 
leaves GnuPG, OpenSSH and others in the dark, or it does and risk that 
userspace does stupid things whether it prints a big fat warning or not.

Of course the warning could be worded like:

process blocking on entropy too early on boot without giving the kernel 
much chance to gather entropy. this is not a kernel issue, report to 
userspace developers

And probably then kill the process, so at least users will know.

However this again would be burdening users with an issue they should 
not have to care about. Unless userspace developers care enough and 
manage to take time to fix the issue before updated kernels come to their 
systems. Cause again it would be users systems that would not be 
working. Just cause kernel and userspace developers did not agree and 
chose to fight with each other instead of talking *with* each other.

At least with killing gdm Systemd may restart it if configured to do so. 
But if it doesn't, the user is again stuck with a non working system 
until restarting gdm themselves.

It may still make sense to make the API harder to use, but it does not 
replace talking with userspace developers and it would need some time to 
allow for adapting userspace applications and services.
