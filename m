Hm, I think I had suggested to use dev_name(&mtd->dev) instead of
mtd->name at some point. But then you have the problem that MTD
numbering is dependent on the probe order which is not guaranteed to
stay the same, so exposing nvmem devices using "mtdXX" name is not super
user-friendly.

Note that some MTD users are expecting MTD names to be unique to work
properly, the example I have in mind is UBI that can be passed the
partition to attach to using the ubi:<part-name> format, but I'm pretty
sure we have other places making the same assumption. I guess not
enforcing mtd->name uniqueness was a bad idea, but I'm not sure we can
change that now.
