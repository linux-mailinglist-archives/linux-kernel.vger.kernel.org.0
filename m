OK, thanks for the clarification. I'll get my board set up again to 
figure out the best fix for rk3399-nanopc-t4 (FWIW most users are 
probably just using passive cooling or a plain DC fan anyway). You might 
want to raise this issue with the maintainers of 
arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos5422-odroidxu3-common.dtsi, since the 
everything-shared-by-everything approach in there was what I used as a 
reference.

Robin.
