Nice detective work and well written changelog!

This wants to be:

  Fix this by using user_64bit_mode() which is always correct.

Be imperative, even if not entirely sure. You nicely put a disclaimer into
the discard section.

This also wants a Fixes tag and cc stable. Interestingly enough this should
have been detected by the rename with

  abfb9498ee13 ("x86/entry: Rename is_{ia32,x32}_task() to in_{ia32,x32}_syscall()")

which states in the changelog:

    The is_ia32_task()/is_x32_task() function names are a big misnomer: they
    suggests that the compat-ness of a system call is a task property, which
    is not true, the compatness of a system call purely depends on how it
    was invoked through the system call layer.
    .....

and then it went and blindly renamed every call site ....

And sadly this was already mentioned here:

   8faaed1b9f50 ("uprobes/x86: Introduce sizeof_long(), cleanup adjust_ret_addr() and arch_uretprobe_hijack_return_addr()")

where the changelog says:

       TODO: is_ia32_task() is not what we actually want, TS_COMPAT does
       not necessarily mean 32bit. Fortunately syscall-like insns can't be
       probed so it actually works, but it would be better to rename and
       use is_ia32_frame().

and goes all the way back to:

    0326f5a94dde ("uprobes/core: Handle breakpoint and singlestep exceptions")

Oh well. 7 years until someone actually tried a uretprobe on a 32bit
process on a 64bit kernel....

  This wants a comment.

No need to resend, I'll fix this up while applying.

Thank you very much for digging into this!
