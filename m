Actually the umview headers go out of their way to define the llseek
syscall as invalid on x86_64 so that the non-llseek path is taken. 
mview-os/xmview/defs_x86_64_um.h:#define __NR__llseek __NR_doesnotexist
It is probably an oversight that this is not done on non-x86. I am not
even sure this builds on non-x86 out of the box.

And if they are supposed to build with !compat it should be removed
there as well.

That's safe but adds junk to the kernel as pointed out in the reply to
that patch.

Thanks
