Hrm, I'm not a fan of adding a param that is only consumed by the handler,
especially when there are multiple alternatives, e.g. fudge the param in
assembly before calling __vdso(), have the enclave supply the context in a
volatile register, etc...

Ah, ret<->tcs, took me a minute...

Does preserving tsc->e->misc ordering matter all that much?  __vdso() needs
to manually copy them either way.  I ask because putting @misc at the end
would allow implementations that don't use @handler to omit the param (if
I've done my math correctly, which is always a big if).  That would make
adding the handler-only param a little more palatable.

Ah, you're referring to the patch where the handler decides to return all
the way back to the caller of __vdso...().

IIUC, this is what you're suggesting?  Having to align the stack makes this
a bit annoying, but it's not bad by any means.

That's reasonable, let's the handler play more games with minimal overhead.
