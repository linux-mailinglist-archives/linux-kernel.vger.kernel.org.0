I'm not sure how dependent the CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG users are on being able 
to modify these are runtime (they've been around for 12+ years) but I 
agree that it seems particularly dangerous.

I think they can be fixed by freezing allocations and frees for the 
particular kmem_cache on all cpus which would add the additional 
conditional in the fastpath and that's going to be required in the very 
small minority of cases where an admin actually wants to change these.

The slub_debug kernel command line options are already pretty 
comprehensive as described by Documentation/vm/slub.rst.  I *think* these 
tunables were primarily introduced for kernel debugging and not general 
purpose, perhaps with the exception of "order".

So I think we may be able to fix "order" with a combination of my patch as 
well as a fix to the freelist randomization and that the others should 
likely be made read only.
