The main reason, is that then we need to add another arch specific
change, where as, the solution I suggested doesn't need anything new.
The less arch specific code we need the better.

We wouldn't need to allocate it, the stub could be something as simple
as:

struct ftrace_ops dummy_ops = {
	.func = ftrace_stub;
}

And just register that, where we set the hash to it, which would
require an malloc and free, but is that really a problem? A modify
shouldn't be a hot path, as text poke itself is going to be slow.
