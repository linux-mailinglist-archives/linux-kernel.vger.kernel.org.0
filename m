Hi Sudeep,

Well, I'm just curious how you would implement notifications.  Would
you have a per-protorcol callback?  The Spec says that multiple agents
can receive them; in our usage we have only one agent and it is Linux.

We have one use case where that this patchset will do wonderfully.  We
have another use case where we would like to go crazy on the
asynchrony of the messages (caller's perspective, that is).
This usage, which I don't think I can talk about, would like to use
notifications and a per-protocol callback function.

I can't think of a case where it would matter.  Just thought I'd mention it.
