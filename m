.

I think I read period as duration leading to confusion. I suggest
using duty-cycle instead of period throughout this series. I think it
will improve the explanation.

The above paragraph could be rewritten as:

"We use a fixed duration of idle injection that gives an acceptable
performance penalty and a fixed latency. Mitigation can be increased
or decreased by modulating the duty cycle of the idle injection."

Perhaps you could also enhance your ascii art above to show fixed
duration idles and different duty cyles to drive home the point.

Yeah, I definitely confused period with duration :-)

Ignore for now.
