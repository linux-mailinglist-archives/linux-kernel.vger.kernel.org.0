Hi Daniel:

I also sent two more patches based on your removal patches:

1. for Disable slave pipeline support
   https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/315860/
2. Computing layer_split and image_enhancer internally
   https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/315861/

Can you merge them together with properties removal patches.

Thanks
james
