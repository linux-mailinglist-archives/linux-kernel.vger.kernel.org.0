I probably could've worded this better -- this comment describes what
userspace sees when they use the API (sched_setattr(2) is an example of
this style of API).

In the case where the kernel doesn't support a requested extension
(usize > ksize, and there are non-zero bytes past ksize) then the kernel
returns -E2BIG *but also* sets p->size to ksize so that userspace knows
what extensions the kernel supports.

Maybe I should've replicated more of the details from the kernel-doc for
copy_struct_from_user().

As above, the -E2BIG only happens if userspace is trying to use an
extension that the kernel doesn't support (usize > ksize, non-zero bytes
after ksize). The main difference between the two API styles is whether
or not userspace gets told what ksize is explicitly in the case of an
-E2BIG.

Maybe it would be less confusing to only mention one of ways of doing
it, but then we have to pick one (and while the newer syscalls [clone3
and openat2] use a separate argument, there are more syscalls which
embed it in the struct).
