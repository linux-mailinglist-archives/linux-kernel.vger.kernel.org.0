Sorry something caught fire and I got distracted.

Alright so it's working right with reads an O_DIRECT.  I'm not entirely sure
what's happening with the buffered side, I will investigate.

The writes I don't expect to work on ext4, there's a priority inversion in ext4
that I haven't bothered to work around since we use btrfs anywhere we want io
control.  That being said it shouldn't be behaving this poorly.  Once I've
wrapped up what I'm currently working on I'll run through this and figure out
the weirdness for these two cases.  Thanks,

Josef
