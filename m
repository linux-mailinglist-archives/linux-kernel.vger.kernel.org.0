Sorry I don't know what is going wrong in my mind. For me, if
pref_address has "read (reloc)", base on the current document, it means
boot loader will read it and also write it, which is conflicting. And
the purpose of pref_address should just inform boot loader that kernel
whats itself to be loaded at certain address, it don't want to be written.
