I think I got your idea, but yet I think it's not the best solution.

Do I understand correctly that you're proposing to introduce
board-specific edp-connector driver that will be aware of worst case
power up delays and will control backlight and power?

Then why not to add another board-specific panel (e.g.
"pine64,pinebook-panel") to simple-panel.c that does the same?

We have a device (Pinebook) that uses the same board with multiple edp
panels. So far there're pinebooks with 3 different panels: 11" with
768p panel, 11" with 1080p panel, 14" with 768p panel.

Currently there's no way to describe all pinebooks with a single dts.
There's a simple workaround though -- we can just specify a panel with
worst power up delays in dts and it'll work since anx6345 driver
ignores panel modes anyway and uses EDID.

Originally I proposed to extend simple-panel driver to support generic
edp-panel but it was rejected. I still believe that it's the best
solution assuming we can specify delays in dts, since panels list is
specific to particular device and it probably can't be reused, i.e.
there's no good reason to move it into C code.

Rob Herring proposed to introduce edp-connector. While I still believe
that it's not accurate description of hardware since it'll have to
have backlight node (backlight is actually panel property) I was OK
with this approach assuming we can store delays in dts.

Later it evolved into board-specific edp-connector.

So far I don't understand why everyone is trying to avoid introducing
edp-panel driver that can read delays from dts. Basically, I don't
understand what's the magic behind simple-panel.c and why new panels
should be added there rather than described in dts. [1] Doesn't
explain that.
