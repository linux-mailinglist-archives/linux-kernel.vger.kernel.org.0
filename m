+====================
+NOTES ON EXT_TRANS:
+====================
+
+SCSI uses block numbers to address blocks/sectors on a device.
+The BIOS uses a cylinder/head/sector addressing scheme (C/H/S)
+scheme instead.  DOS expects a BIOS or driver that understands
+this C/H/S addressing.
+
+The number of cylinders/heads/sectors is called geometry and is
+required as base for requests in  C/H/S  addressing.  SCSI only
+knows about the total capacity  of  disks  in blocks (sectors).
+
+Therefore the SCSI BIOS/DOS driver has to calculate a logical/virtual
+geometry just  to  be  able  to  support  that addressing scheme. The
+geometry returned by the SCSI BIOS is  a  pure  calculation  and  has
+nothing to do with the  real/physical  geometry  of  the  disk (which
+is usually irrelevant anyway).
+
+Basically this has no impact at all on Linux, because it also  uses block
+instead of C/H/S addressing.  Unfortunately C/H/S addressing is also used
+in the partition table and therefore every operating  system  has to know
+the right geometry to be able to interpret it.
+
+Moreover there are certain limitations to the  C/H/S  addressing scheme,
+namely the address space is limited to up to 255 heads, up to 63 sectors
+and a maximum of 1023 cylinders.
+
+The AHA-1522 BIOS calculates the geometry by fixing the number of heads
+to 64, the number of sectors to  32  and  by  calculating the number of
+cylinders by dividing the capacity reported by the disk by 64*32 (1 MB).
+This is considered to be the default translation.
+
+With respect to the limit of 1023 cylinders using C/H/S you can only
+address the first GB of your disk in the partition table.  Therefore
+BIOSes of some  newer controllers based on the AIC-6260/6360 support
+extended  translation.  This means that the BIOS uses 255 for heads,
+63 for  sectors  and then divides the capacity of the disk by 255*63
+(about 8 MB), as soon it sees a disk greater than 1 GB. That results
+in a maximum of about 8 GB addressable  diskspace  in the  partition
+table (but there are already bigger disks out there today).
+
+To make it even more complicated the translation mode might/might
+not be configurable in certain BIOS setups.
+
+This driver does some more or less failsafe guessing to get the
+geometry right in most cases:
+
+- for disks<1GB:
+  -use default translation (C/32/64)
+
+- for disks>1GB:
+  - take current geometry from the partition table (using scsicam_bios_param
+    and accept only `valid` geometries, ie. either (C/32/64) or (C/63/255)).
+    This can be extended translation even if it's not enabled in the driver.
+
+  - if that fails, take extended translation if  enabled  by override,
+    kernel or module parameter, otherwise take default translation and
+    ask the user for verification.  This might on  not yet partitioned
+    disks.
