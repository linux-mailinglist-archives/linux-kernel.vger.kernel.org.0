I would call this fatal_signal_time to make the meaning more clear.

I might be too dumb but the above code looks pretty tricky to me.
It would deserve a comment. Or better, I would remove
trick to handle overflow. If it happens, we would just
lose one check period.

Alternative solution would be to set the timestamp in
complete_signal(). Then we would know that the timestamp
is always valid when a fatal signal is pending.

IMHO, the delayed task exit is much less fatal than sleeping
in an uninterruptible state.

Anyway, the check is much less reliable. In case of hung_task,
it is enough when the task gets scheduled. In the new check,
the task has to do some amount of work until the signal
gets handled and do_exit() is called.

The panic should either get enabled separately or we should
never panic in this case.
