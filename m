In order to solve the recursion issue without losing instrumentation
coverage of traps and significant system events, I really think we should
look into adding some kind of "in_tracing" flag near each stack. We could
name this "struct recursion_context" or something similar. We could then
add this structure alongside each thread and ISR stack, but make sure traps
(including breakpoints) still point to the recursion context of whatever
caused the trap.

This should allow us to detect and prevent recursion from tracers directly
at the instrumentation level.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
