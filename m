Like this, courtesy of the consolidation of RCU flavors:

	previous_reader()
	{
		rcu_read_lock();
		do_something(); /* Preemption happened here. */
		local_irq_disable(); /* Cannot be the scheduler! */
		do_something_else();
		rcu_read_unlock();  /* Must defer QS, task still queued. */
		do_some_other_thing();
		local_irq_enable();
	}

	current_reader() /* QS from previous_reader() is still deferred. */
	{
		local_irq_disable();  /* Might be the scheduler. */
		do_whatever();
		rcu_read_lock();
		do_whatever_else();
		rcu_read_unlock();  /* Must still defer reporting QS. */
		do_whatever_comes_to_mind();
		local_irq_enable();
	}

Both instances of rcu_read_unlock() need to cause some later thing
to report the quiescent state, and in some cases it will do a wakeup.
Now, previous_reader()'s IRQ disabling cannot be due to scheduler rq/pi
locks due to the rule about holding them across the entire RCU reader
if they are held across the rcu_read_unlock().  But current_reader()'s
IRQ disabling might well be due to the scheduler rq/pi locks, so
current_reader() must be careful about doing wakeups.

No, but that can also happen.

Yes, exp_hint would unconditionally be set to false in the first
reader's rcu_read_unlock().  But .blocked won't be.

Or adjust the code and requirements to make it more sane, if feasible.

My current (probably wildly unreliable) guess that the conditions in
rcu_read_unlock_special() need adjusting.  I was assuming that in_irq()
implies a hardirq context, in other words that in_irq() would return
false from a threaded interrupt handler.  If in_irq() instead returns
true from within a threaded interrupt handler, then this code in
rcu_read_unlock_special() needs fixing:

		if ((exp || in_irq()) && irqs_were_disabled && use_softirq &&
		    (in_irq() || !t->rcu_read_unlock_special.b.deferred_qs)) {
			// Using softirq, safe to awaken, and we get
			// no help from enabling irqs, unlike bh/preempt.
			raise_softirq_irqoff(RCU_SOFTIRQ);

The fix would be replacing the calls to in_irq() with something that
returns true only if called from within a hardirq context.

Thoughts?

Ugh.  Same question about IRQ work.  Will the current use of it by
rcu_read_unlock_special() cause breakage in the presence of threaded
interrupt handlers?
