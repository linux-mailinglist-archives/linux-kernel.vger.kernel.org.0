FWIW, the thing that is IME absolutely incompatible with bisection
is CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT.  It can affect frequencies badly
enough, even in the cases when the bug isn't directly dependent
upon that thing.

I suspect that nonsense bisects spewed by CI bots lately (bisect on
x86 oops ending up at commit limited to arch/parisc, etc.) are at
least partially due to that kind of garbage...
