For your kind Attention Sir,

I am looking to work with a reputable individual/firm to engage in a
profit oriented ventures in your country and perhaps with your
assistance, we could get low tax rates. I have the directive of H.E
Mohamed Abdullah former Petroleum Minister from Libya to source for
partner abroad who can accommodate and manage $320 Million USD. The
sums are derived from an executed project deal with Yukos Oil Company
before the company was merged into Rosneft Oil Corporation.

If you are taking the fund directly as a company and supervise the
total investment over there and proceeds will be shared 50/50.
We need to maintain absolute confidentiality in the transaction as the
fund provider want to remain silent and Hard copy of (MOU) AGREEMENT
will be sign on our meeting.

We shall apply for the necessary paper work required to re-profile
your name as the recipient and also ensure payment is made via T.T
Telegraphic Transfer to your bank account in your name. I guaranty we
would execute this business under a legitimate arrangement without
breach of the law.

Note: Contact me on my private EMAIL:  mr.mohammedabdulah1@gmail.com
 For further details.

Best Regards
Mr M. Abdullah.
