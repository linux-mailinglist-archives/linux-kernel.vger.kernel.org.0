If you're fixing a bug in mainline, I'd prefer to see that as a separate
patch.

I think this is probably at the heart of my misunderstanding. What is so
special about PAs (is this HW PA or CPU PA?) below 0x40000000? Is this RAM
or something else?

I mean, we could even talk on the phone if necessary because I can't accept
this code unless I understand how it works!

To be blunt, I'd like to avoid the io-pgtable changes looking different to
what I suggested:

so anything else should ideally go in the driver. The change above gives
the driver control over bits 4 and 9 in the pte, which I hope should be
sufficient. That said, yet another thing I don't understand is how the
IOMMU page table walker views physical addresses :/

Anyway, in your diff here...

... I'd like to drop the oas check, because the driver should be passing
in physical addresses with bit 32 set in this case, and...

... here I simply don't understand the significance of 0x40000000.
