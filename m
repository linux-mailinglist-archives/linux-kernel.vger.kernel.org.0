Don't top post, and split your lines at 80 columns. Tested-by: only makes
sense if someone else tested your code; that you have tested it yourself
is (or should be) implied in the Signed-off-by: tag (that people sometimes
send patches which don't even compile is no excuse).

Thanks,

I have always judged that checking this bit has no value, and it can be problematic. If the part is set to have a very long transition rate, like 5 seconds, this would hang the call for a long time. That seemed bad to me, and is why I did not poll this bit.
