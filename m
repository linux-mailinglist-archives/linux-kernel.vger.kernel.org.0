Yes, that's true and that's why I put wording "to some extent" above.

Yes. It's used in children. BUT. This structure covers several PMIC chips and
the children driver doesn't know which generation / version of PMIC is serving.

What you are proposing with the change is to strictly link the children driver
to PMIC gen X ver Y, while above example doesn't do that.

So, I'm not convinced it's a good change to have.
