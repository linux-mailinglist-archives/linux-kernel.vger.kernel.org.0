For modules we use a combination of scripts/module-common.lds and an
architecture's own module.lds, not vmlinux.lds.h. So I don't think the above is
relevant for modules.

For modules the kernel's ELF loader looks for the ELF ection, not the
__{start,stop}_mcount_loc symbols that we use for the main kernel image.

FWIW, when building a module, I see the following linker operations:

| [mark@blommer:~/src/linux]% toolchain korg gcc-8.1.0-nolibc make V=1 ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux- arch/arm64/crypto/sha512-ce.ko | grep aarch64-linux-ld

I agree that the CC_USING_PATCHABLE_FUNCTION_ENTRY ifdeffery could be
simplified, and that it would be nice to consistently use
FTRACE_CALLSITE_SECTION if we can. However, the generic linker script doesn't
include anything, and I don't see a good location for that to live.

What I could do is add an explicit comment:

/*
 * The ftrace call sites are logged to a section whose name depends on the
 * compiler option used. A given kernel image will only use one, AKA
 * FTRACE_CALLSITE_SECTION. We capture all of them here to avoid header
 * dependencies.
 */
#define MCOUNT_REC()						\
			. = ALIGN(8);				\
			__start_mcount_loc = .;			\
			KEEP(*(__patchable_function_entries))   \
			KEEP(*(__mcount_loc))                   \
			__stop_mcount_loc = .;			

... which should make the dependency clear. Does that sound good to you?

Thanks,
Mark.
