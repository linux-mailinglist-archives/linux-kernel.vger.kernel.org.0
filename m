At least 2 key fixes are in TIP tree:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/157384597983.12247.8995835529288193538.tip-bot2@tip-bot2/
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/157384597947.12247.7200239597382357556.tip-bot2@tip-bot2/

The two issues are blocking kernel boot when split lock is enabled.

I'll send out other 6 fixes for atomic bitops shortly. These issues are found
by code inspection.

Thanks.
