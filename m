Hi, James,

I can't reproduce this problem. If the current system doesn't support spe, it shouldn't report an error. I use the latest codes of the mainline:

commit f116b96685a046a89c25d4a6ba2da489145c8888 (mainline/master)
Merge: f632bfaa33ed 603d9299da32
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 24 06:13:45 2019 -0400

    Merge tag 'mfd-fixes-5.4' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lee/mfd

I will go and see why this will be reported.

Do you mean that I can add these as new events to perf? If we think of them as new events, what should we do if the user does not add :pp for them?
(Or for these events, users can only add :pp to use them?)

What you mean is that we can filter with spe events(like BR_MIS_PRED) first, and if we have other events that are exactly the same(no more for now), then we can handle them by adding OR in the future?

Yes. You are right. I got a error for this case. I will fix it.

------------------
./perf record -e branch-misses:p ls
Error:
You may not have permission to collect stats.

Thanks.
