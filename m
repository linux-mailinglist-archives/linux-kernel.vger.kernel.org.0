I don't know if it is applicable for all users, but for the drivers
such info is better to be placed in /sys/ as separate file (for example
/sys/class/net/wlp3s0/*) and driver/core will be responsible to
register/unregister.

It will ensure that all drivers get this info without need to register
and make /proc/meminfo and /proc/meminfo_extra too large.
