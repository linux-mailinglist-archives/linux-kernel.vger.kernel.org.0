Do you plan to prep that, or should I? Doesn't really matter to me,
and assuming Daniel Thompson doesn't have any last minute concerns
should still be enough time to get it all sorted and have a few weeks
of testing left before the merge window.

Fully agreed, no need to rush anything here. For the drm-misc account
you need to request an SSH legacy account here by filing a issue:

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/issues/new

Select the "New SSH account" template, it has instructions with
everything that's needed.

For the getting started howto, see
https://drm.pages.freedesktop.org/maintainer-tools/getting-started.html

If that all looks good and you're set up I think best to test-drive
the entire process with the MAINTAINERS patch to change the git repo
for 5.4.

Cheers, Daniel
