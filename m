you are correct that this is only part of what is needed to get things
working.  We also need Bjorn's patch set to inherit SMR and CB config
during init:

Perhaps the GPU part of the problem.  The display part is not.
However I'm fine to move the "don't actually attach" part into
arm-smmu if that is preferred.  The next person to hit the same
problem on a different iommu could certainly move the check or copy it
into their iommu driver.

well, "solve" == "it boots fine and doesn't explode"..

I'm certainly happy to entertain alternative suggestions, but these
are real problems that need solutions.
