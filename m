That'd been what I'd intially read the commit message as saying :/

We already have a kaslr-seed property on arm64 since we need a seed for
KASLR *super* early, we could generalize that I guess but it's not clear
to me that it's a good idea.  One fun thing here is that the kernel
command line is visible to userspace so we go and erase the seed from
the command line after reading it.

Anything that requires boot protocol updates is going to be rather
difficult to deploy for the use it'll likely get - as far as I can see
we're basically just talking about the cases where there's some entropy
source available to the bootloader that the kernel can't get at
directly.  With the arm64 kaslr-seed it's not clear that people are
feeding actual entropy in there, they could be using something like the
device serial number to give different layouts on different devices even
if they can't get any useful entropy for boot to boot variation.
