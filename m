Well, I would say why not. If saying anything hurted, I often check
/proc/zoneinfo to get information about system memory like many people,
I was wondering why the protection data is over there, but it's am
empty zone, and they protect what. I dare say it's more than once I
asked to myself, just sometime I am too lazy to start to make it clear
when focusing on another issue. Not sure if that is kind of hurting. I
would like to see it's not there to confuse me if anyone else have
stood up to fix it, I absolutely will vote for it.

Surely, we also need to evaluate if any risk or complexity is involved, 
While with my understanding, I don't see risk, and the change is quite
simple and easy to understand.
