"[PATCH] printk: Monitor change of console loglevel." is targeted for
linux-next only, and I estimate that this patch will be removed in a
week or so, for syzbot can reproduce this problem using linux-next and
syzbot will blacklist testcases causing this problem.

"[PATCH] kernel/hung_task.c: Monitor killed tasks." is targeted for upstream, for
syzbot is hitting this problem in any tree and this will be a kernel's problem.
But for feasibility check, for now I want to try this patch on only linux-next.
I guess we need to tune (e.g. add sysctl) before sending to linux.git tree.

I am seeking for an approach which is less burden for both of you. But it
seems that using Andrew's route seems to fit better for Stephen's workflow.

OK. Then, will you carry these patches?

Regards.
