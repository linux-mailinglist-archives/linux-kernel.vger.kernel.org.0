Sounds good to me, just make sure that you no longer reference
HCI_TIME_STAMP and it should be fine with both old and new libc
versions.

SO_TIMESTAMPNS was first added to the kernel in linux-2.6.22, which
is probably older than anything you care about,  but I'm not sure what you
need to do to use it on bluetooth. It appears to have first been added along
with the monitor channel support in linux-3.4.

On a semi-related note, I see that there is a y2038 compatibility in the
libpcap definition of struct pcap_timeval, which uses a *signed* tv_sec
field. I assume the sizes of the fields cannot be changed, but it would
be good to investigate if you can just make it unsigned instead, changing
the supported time range from 1902...2038 to 1970...2106.
It probably makes sense to do this together with supporting nanosecond
timestamps. You could also consider changing the format to use a
64-bit nanosecond value starting at either 1970 or 1902 to give an
even larger range.
