Tagnentially, it looks like that assumption is made elsewhere, and could
do with a more general cleanup. IIUC, the following are suspect:

* kmemleak's scan_should_stop()
* x86's __kernel_fpu_begin()
* arm64's arch_dup_task_struct()

It's probably worth an is_thread(task) helper so that those can be
written in an obviously correct way.

Wouldn't !PF_KTHREAD imply current->mm anyhow?

Thanks,
