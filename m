If the machine runs at/close to capacity, won't the overallocation
of the quota to bursty tasks necessarily negatively impact every other
task? Should the "unused" quota be available only on idle CPUs?
(Or maybe this is the behavior achieved here, and only the comment and
the commit message should be fixed...)
