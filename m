Can't we do this on top of this patch? I want a trivially backportable fix
for -stable.

And who else can use this helper? And what exactly it should do? Should it
be called with rcu lock held? Should it check sig != 0? Name?

Hmm. How can mqueue use SIGQUEUE_PREALLOC/send_sigqueue ? The timer can
pre-allocate sigqueue because it won't be used again until dequeued by
its single target, otherwise it just increments overrun.

mqueue can't. Just suppose that the user of mq_notify() blocks this signal,
then another task does mq_notify() and then __do_notify() is called again.

I don't really agree, but I won't argue.

Yes. Yet I think they all differ, in particular in how they handle the
exec case. So I still do not understand a) how you are going to unify this
logic and b) why should we do this _before_ the fix.

Not sure I understand how this connects to fd-passing...

What I tried to say is that mqueue_fd will be closed on exec. This is not
not enough, but mqueue_flush_file==mqueue_file_operations->flush called
by filp_close() will remove the notification to ensure the signal can't
be sent after that.

Ah, OK, agreed, I'll add a comment.

OK, how about

	static int notified;

	static void sigh(int sig)
	{
		notified = 1;
	}

	int main(void)
	{
		signal(SIGIO, sigh);

		int fd = mq_open("/mq", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0666, NULL);
		assert(fd >= 0);

		struct sigevent se = {
			.sigev_notify	= SIGEV_SIGNAL,
			.sigev_signo	= SIGIO,
		};
		assert(mq_notify(fd, &se) == 0);

		if (!fork()) {
			setuid(1);
			mq_send(fd, "",1,0);
			return 0;
		}

		wait(NULL);
		mq_unlink("/mq");
		assert(notified);
		return 0;
	}

? Needs root.

Just in case... it passes on my machine running 4.2.8-300.fc23.x86_64, fails
with upstream kernel, the patch seems to work and looks very simple.

Oleg.
