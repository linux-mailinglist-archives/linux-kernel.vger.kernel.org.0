I'm fighting with lkp tests.. looks like it's not fedora friendly ;-)

which specific test is doing this? perhaps I can dig it out and run
without the script machinery..

could you share the change?

could you also post one (for same data) without the callchains?

  # perf c2c report --stdio --call-graph none

it should show the read/write/offset for cachelines in more
readable way

I'd be also interested to see the data if you can share (no worries
if not) ... I'd need the perf.data and bz2 file from 'perf archive'
run on the perf.data

I don't have access to cascade lake, but AFAICT the bigger
machine the bigger issues with false sharing ;-)
