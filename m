Yes this does appear to only affect imported buffers from what I can
tell. Looking through the code there is something suspicious in
drm_gem_map_dma_buf(). The following "fixes" the problem. But I'm not
sure the reasoning behind DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC being specified -
presumably someone though it was a good idea! I'm not sure which driver's
responsibility it is to ensure the caches are flushed.
