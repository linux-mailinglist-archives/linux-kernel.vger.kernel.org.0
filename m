This sounds strange. The write barrier should be done only on CPU
that really modified tail_lpos. I.e. it should be in _dataring_pop()
after successful dr->tail_lpos modification.

All these comments talk about sychronization against read barriers.
It means that we would need a write barrier here. But it does
not make much sense to do write barrier before actually
writing dr->head_lpos.

After all I think that we do not need any barrier here.
The write barrier for dr->tail_lpos should be in
_dataring_pop(). The read barrier is not needed because
we are not reading anything here.

Instead we should put a barrier after modyfying dr->head_lpos,
see below.

We need a write barrier here to make sure that dr->head_lpos
is updated before we start updating other values, e.g.
db->id below.
