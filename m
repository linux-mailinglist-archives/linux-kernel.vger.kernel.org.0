"trapper" is an odd term here (oh, maybe this was a typo of
"wrapper"?). Regardless, is there a need to separate blkzone from
blkoops? It seems everything would just use blkoops directly, even
mtdpstore?

It would be nice to extract ftrace_log_combine() from ram.c and make the
front-end and inode layers aware of this as a way to auto-merge the
records from all backends supporting ftrace.

Given this clarification, I'd say there is no reason to discuss
blkzone.c at all.

I still think some other term is needed for "non-block device", since it
_is_ a block device. i.e. we're using it with pstore/blk. ;) I find it
just odd language.

I love the docs; thank you for them! As mentioned in the other email,
perhaps add a section at the bottom like:

blkoops internals
-----------------

For developer reference, here are all the important structures and APIs:

.. kernel-doc: fs/pstore/blkzone.c
   :internal:

.. kernel-doc: fs/pstore/blkoops.c
   :export:

etc
