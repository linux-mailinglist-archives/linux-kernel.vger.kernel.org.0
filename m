I would like clarify that, we are not trying to convince that most of=20
the increase of the latency is from resource contention. Actually, we=20
also have data showing scheduling latency contributes more to the=20
latency overhead:

side job | cpu.headroom |  cpu-idle | wall time | cpu time | wall - cpu
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 none    |     n/a      |    42.4%  |   1.00    |   0.31   |   0.69
ffmpeg   |       0      |    10.8%  |   1.17    |   0.38   |   0.79
ffmpeg   |     25%      |    22.8%  |   1.08    |   0.35   |   0.73

Compared against first row, second row shows 17% of latency overhead=20
(wall time). Among this 17%, 7% is in the "cpu time" column, which=20
is from resource contention (lower IPC). The other 10% (wall - cpu) is
mostly from scheduling latency. These experiments already have Viresh's
current patch. Scheduling latency contributes more in the overall=20
latency w/o Viresh's patch.=20

So we agree that, in this case, most of the increased latency comes=20
from scheduling latency.=20

However, we still think cpu.headroom would add value. The following=20
table shows comparison of ideal cases, where we totally eliminated the=20
overhead of scheduling latency.=20

side job | cpu.headroom |  cpu-idle | wall time | cpu time | wall - cpu
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 none    |     n/a      |    42.4%  |   1.00    |   0.31   |   0.69
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        below are all from estimation, not from experiments
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ffmpeg   |       0      |     TBD   |   1.07    |   0.38   |   0.69
ffmpeg   |     25%      |     TBD   |   1.04    |   0.35   |   0.69

We can see, cpu.headroom helps control latency even with ideal scheduling.=
=20
The saving here (from 7% overhead to 4%) is not as significant. But it is
still meaningful in some cases.=20
=20
More important, cpu.headroom gives us mechanism to control the latency
overhead. It is a _protection_ mechanism, not some optimization. It is=20
somehow similar to current cpu.max knob, which limits the max cpu usage
of certain workload. cpu.headroom is more flexible than cpu.max, because
cpu.headroom could adjust the limits based on system load level dynamically=
.=20

Does this explanation make sense?

Thanks,
Song
