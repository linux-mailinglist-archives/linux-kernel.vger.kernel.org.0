try to blacklist btusb.ko module. Create /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-btusb.conf with the content of "blacklist vc4”. Then once booted, start “btmon -w trace.log” and then “modprobe btusb”. This should give you the initial firmware loading trace.

I am just assuming that the module is connected via USB, if not then you need to let me know.

>> We have only seen this with Atheros hardware so far, but it might happen for others as well. It indicates that this is an unexpected event. Normally you can ignore this warning since it just indicates an existing issue that we just papered over before. So if everything works as before, just ignore it,

The 0xfc2f command is never issued by btusb.c or btintel.c actually. It is a command to apply the BDDATA information used only by Intel AG6xx devices which are UART only. So I am almost certain that this is a bug in the hardware / firmware and the patch above just started to highlight it. The trace will show if that is the case.

Marcel
