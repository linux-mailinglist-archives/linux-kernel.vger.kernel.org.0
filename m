Ah! Thank you. Yes, that's _much_ cleaner. I could not figure out why
the linker was actually keeping the .bss section allocated in the
on-disk image. :) We've only had this bug for 10 years. ;)

With bzip2, it's a 4MB heap in .bss. Other compressors are 64KB. With
fg-kaslr, the heap is 64MB in .bss. It made the bzImage huge. ;) Another
thought I had to deal with the memory utilization in the fg-kaslr shuffle
was to actually choose _two_ kernel locations in memory (via a refactoring
of choose_random_location()). One to decompress into and the other to
write out during the shuffle. Though the symbol table still needs to be
reconstructed, etc, so probably just best to leave it all in the regular
heap (or improve the ZO heap allocator which doesn't really implement
free()).

Yes, thank you for the reminder. I couldn't find the ZO_INIT_SIZE when I
was staring at this, since I only looked around the compressed/ directory.
:)

I should add this:
