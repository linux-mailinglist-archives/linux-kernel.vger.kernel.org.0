I see that on all of my boards as well (3900X, different boards and board vendors),
with temperatures reported by the Super-IO chip sometimes as low as 0.18V (!).
Yet, there is a clear correlation of that voltage with CPU load.
I suspect the measurement by the Super-IO chip is a different voltage.

I don't think there is anything we can do about that without access to more
information.

Initially I thought the voltage reported by the Super-IO chip would help
us understand what is going on, but that is not really the case.

The problem with Ken's board is that idle current and voltage are very high.
The idle voltage claims to be higher than the voltage under load, which
doesn't really make sense. This is only reflected in the voltage and current
reported by the CPU, but not by the voltage reported by the Super-IO chip.

Thanks,
Guenter
