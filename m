Is there anything missing? It would be nice to get this in 5.4. There is a lot 
of H6 boards which needs DDC bus enable mechanism (part of H6 reference 
design), including Beelink GS1 which already has HDMI node in mainline kernel 
DT, but due to disabled DDC lines works only with 1024x768 (fallback 
resolution in DRM core).

Best regards,
Jernej
