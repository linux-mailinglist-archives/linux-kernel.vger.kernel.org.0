That's fine. I think the features changes can stay on -rcu/kcsan-dev
for now, but the documentation updates don't depend on them.
If it'd be useful, the updated documentation could be moved before
this patch to -rcu/kcsan, so we'd have

 kcsan: Add current->state to implicitly atomic accesses
 kcsan: Add option for verbose reporting
 kcsan: Add option to allow watcher interruptions
-- cut --
 kcsan: Update API documentation in kcsan-checks.h
 kcsan: Update Documentation/dev-tools/kcsan.rst
 kcsan: Fix a typo in a comment
.. rest of series ..

Although I'm fine with either.

Thanks,
-- Marco
