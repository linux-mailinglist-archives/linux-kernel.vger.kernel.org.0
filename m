Yes, I know it. However, my machine has two ACPI regions (command
buffer and response buffer) below, and the crb_fixup_cmd_size()
function couldn't check the point, "a buffer that if fully outside the
ACPI region". I will explain the exact case at the end of my email.

Yes, the driver deals with only one ACPI region, and it works fine in
most cases. However, two ACPI regions are in the system like above,
then crb_map_io() function calls crb_map_res() function twice.
crb_map_res() function calls devm_ioremap_resouce(). So, TPM CRB
driver handles two separated regions, command buffer and response
buffer. I will also explain in detail at the end of my email.

I'm sorry for my mistake. I checked it.

Thank you for your advice. I will change it on your advice.

I got an AMD system which had a Ryzen Threadripper 1950X and MSI
mainboard. I had a problem with AMD's fTPM, and my machine showed an
error message below.

[  5.732084] tpm_crb MSFT0101:00: can't request region for resource
[mem 0x79b4f000-0x79b4ffff]
[  5.732089] tpm_crb: probe of MSFT0101:00 failed with error -16

When I saw the iomem, I found two fTPM regions were in the ACPI NVS
area. The regions are below.

79a39000-79b6afff : ACPI Non-volatile Storage
  79b4b000-79b4bfff : MSFT0101:00
  79b4f000-79b4ffff : MSFT0101:00

I analyzed this issue and will explain in detail what happened in my system.
1) When the system was booted, acpi_bus_scan() function found two
MSFT0101:00 resources and inserted them into iomem_resource. The
regions were [0x79b4b000-0x79b4bfff] and [0x79b4f000-0x79b4ffff]. From
now, I will call the first one Region A and the second one Region B.

2) When the tpm_crb driver was loaded, crb_map_io() function was
called. Then, crb_map_io() called acpi_dev_get_resources(), and it got
Region B for the io_res variable because it found the last region from
iomem_resource as you said.

3) crb_map_io() function called devm_ioremap_resource() with io_res
(Region B). However, it returned fail because ACPI NVS area was set to
the busy area.

4*) So, I removed the busy bit from ACPI NVS by changing
do_mark_busy() function. I sent the patch to you and here is the link,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/26/163 . After patching it,
devm_ioremap_resource() returned successfully. Then, crb_map_io()
called crb_map_res() with io_res and buf->control_address variables,
and it also returned successfully.

5)  crb_map_io() got command buffer's physical address and size from
priv->regs_t->ctrl_cmd_pa_high/low and ctrl_cmd_size. The results were
that cmd_pa was 0x79b4b000 and the size was 0x4000. cmd_pa was in
Region A, however, io_res was Region B as I mentioned before. So, when
crb_map_io() called crb_fixup_cmd_size() with io_res and 0x4000
arguments, the function returned 0x4000, not 0xfff becuase cmd_pa was
outside of Region B.

6) crb_map_io() called crb_map_res() with io_res (Region B), cmd_pa
(Region A), and cmd_size (0x4000), then the crb_map_res() tried to
call devm_ioremap_resource() because io_res didn't contain cmd_pa and
size. But, Region A's size was 0xfff, so devm_ioremap_resource()
couldn't allocate resource and failed. If crb_fixup_cmd_size()
compared cmd_pa/size with all regions, it could find Region A and
return the correct size 0xfff.

7*) So, I changed crb_fixup_cmd_size() with the attached patch so that
it compared arguments with all regions. After that, the function
returned the correct size 0xfff, and crb_map_res() added Region A and
returned successfully.

8) crb_map_io() got response buffer's physical address and size from
priv->regs_t->ctrl_rsp_pa and ctrl_rsp_size. The results were that
rsp_pa was 0x79b4f000 and the size is 0x4000. rsp_pa was in Region B,
and the new crb_fixup_cmd_size() I fixed returned 0xfff.

9) crb_map_io() called crb_map_res() with rsp_pa (Region B) and
rsp_size (0xfff) because cmd_pa (0x79b4b000) was not equal to rsp_pa
(0x79b4f000). The function returned successfully, and TPM was also
registered successfully.

10*) After applying my patches, AMD's fTPM worked fine and final iomem is below.

79a39000-79b6afff : ACPI Non-volatile Storage
  79b4b000-79b4bfff : MSFT0101:00
    79b4b000-79b4bfff : MSFT0101:00
  79b4f000-79b4ffff : MSFT0101:00
    79b4f000-79b4ffff : MSFT0101:00

Lastly, I would like to answer your two questions and request something.

> 1. The code loops through all found ACPI regions when looking for
>    intersections with the command and response buffers.

As I said, the purpose of the code loop is to find the exact buffer
size and so that I don't get failure from crb_map_res and(). If it
doesn't check all regions, then it returns the passed size again and
causes failure.

> 2. The devm_ioremap() is done only to the last seen ACPI region. Why the
>    multiple regions matter for fixup's but not in this case?

Actually, if the system has two regions as you have seen above,
devm_ioremap() is called again because of crb_map_res() function. So,
multiple regions are matters in this case.

If you are OK, I would like to make a patch v2 on your advice. I also
would like to ask you about the other patch I sent to you,
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/26/163 . Would you give me some advice
about them?
