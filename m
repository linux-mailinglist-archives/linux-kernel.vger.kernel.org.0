Maybe Srini has some input here. It looks like your main concern is
consumer to provider mapping?

I'm not sure how an ACPI system like this would work because my exposure
to ACPI is extremely limited. I would expect there to be some sort of
firmware property indicating that an nvmem should be used and it's
provided by VPD or for firmware to parse VPD itself and put the
information into the ACPI table for this device.

Has either of those things been done? If it is a reference/property in
firmware then it should be possible to connect consumer devices like the
audio device you mention to VPD via the nvmem APIs with some changes to
the nvmem framework assuming there's an approach for nvmem in ACPI in
some "standard" way.=20

I'd like to use nvmem for two reasons. First, it is a kernel framework
for reading non-volatile memories, which is fairly close to what VPD is
for. Second, it makes a standard, i.e. non-vpd/coreboot specific, API
that drivers can use to read memories. Of course in ASoC the machine
driver is already very platform specific, but the idea is to avoid
platform specific APIs so that drivers are loosely coupled with the rest
of the kernel. We shouldn't push against that goal by introducing more
platform specific APIs.
