OK.  How about this?

Systems running a large number of jobs in different cgroups want to
profiling such jobs precisely.  This includes container hosting systems
widely used today.  Currently perf supports namespace tracking but
the systems may not use (cgroup) namespace for their jobs.  Also
it'd be more intuitive to see cgroup names (as they're given by user
or sysadmin) rather than numeric cgroup/namespace id even if they
use the namespaces.

Thanks,
