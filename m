This is exactly what cover letters are for!

If the OSD checked for unknown flags, like newer syscalls do, it would
be super easy, but it looks like it doesn't.

An obvious solution is to look at require_osd_release in osdmap, but we
don't decode that in the kernel because it lives the OSD portion of the
osdmap.  We could add that and consider the fact that the client now
needs to decode more than just the client portion a design mistake.
I'm not sure what can of worms does that open and if copy-from alone is
worth it though.  Perhaps that field could be moved to (or a copy of it
be replicated in) the client portion of the osdmap starting with
octopus?  We seem to be running into it on the client side more and
more...

Given the track record of this feature (the fix for the most recently
discovered data corrupting bug hasn't even merged yet), I would be very
hesitant to turn it back on by default even if we figure out a good
solution for the feature check.  In my opinion, it should stay opt-in.

Thanks,

                Ilya
