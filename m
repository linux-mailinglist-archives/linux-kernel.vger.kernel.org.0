/proc/<pid>/exe is a symlink. It doesn't seem like it's possible to
unlink it and re-link it to something else (fails with EPERM).

Is there a way to do this?

The use-case is identifying which process is at the other end of the
socket. Once the process is identified, security rules can be applied.
For instance a Wayland compositor might give access to a
screen capture interface if the program is a trusted screen shooter.

Some want to get the full path to the executable, and read the
/proc/<pid>/exe symlink. Some want to read a special file created at
the root of the process' file system namespace, and access
/proc/<pid>/root.
