False.
"formail -s scripts/checkpatch.pl < bundle-foo.mbox" splits
"bundle-foo.mbox" in separate patches, and invokes
"scripts/checkpatch.pl" for each of them.

False, due to the splitting by formail.

Yeah, because you're concatenating all patches.
Currently it works for single patches only.

Perhaps.  Just passing the patchwork bundle to checkpatch, and fixing
checkpatch to handle multiple patches in a single file was my first idea.
But it looked fragile, with too much state that needs to be reset.
I.e. the state is not limited to %signatures.  You also have to reset
$author inside process(), and probably a dozen other variables.
And make sure that future changes don't forget resetting all newly
introduced variables.

Hence I settled for the solution using formail.
