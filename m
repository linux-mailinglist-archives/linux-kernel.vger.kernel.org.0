Actually, there is no need to use syscon for CGU in LGM. It got carried

over from older SoCs (Falcon Mountain) where CGU was a MFD device

because it included PHY registers as well. And PHY drivers were using

syscon node to access CGU regmap. But for LGM, this is not the case.

My understanding is that if we do not use syscon, then there is no

point in using regmap because this driver uses simple 32 bit register

access. Can directly read/write registers using readl() & writel().

Would you agree ?


Yi Xin, please correct me if you think i am mistaken anywhere. If not,

i will change the driver to not use regmap & instead use readl() &

writel().

We need OF_EARLY_FLATTREE for LGM. But adding a new x86

platform for LGM is discouraged because that would lead to too

many platforms. Only differentiating factor for LGM is CPU model

ID but it can differentiate only at run time. So i had no option

other then enabling it with some LGM specific core system module

driver and CGU seemed perfect for this purpose.

I went through meson & qcom regmap clock code. Agree, it can be

reused for mux, divider and gate. But as mentioned above, i am now

considering to move away from using regmap.
