Thank you for your notification. I am sorry. I missed it and
misunderstood Jarkko's idea. So, I would like to invite Matthew
Garrett to this thread and attach my opinion on that. The problem is
that command and response buffers are in ACPI NVS area. ACPI NVS area
is saved and restored by drivers/acpi/nvs.c during hibernation, so
command and response buffers in ACPI NVS are also handled by nvs.c
file. However, TPM CRB driver uses the buffers to control a TPM
device, therefore, something may break.

I agree on that point. To remove uncertainty and find the solution,
I read the threads we discussed and did research about two points, 1)
the race condition and 2) the unexpected behavior of the TPM device.

1) The race condition concern comes from unknowing buffer access order
while hibernation.
If nvs.c and TPM CRB driver access the buffers concurrently, the race
condition occurs. Then, we can't know the contents of the buffers
deterministically, and it may occur the failure of TPM device.
However, hibernation_snapshot() function calls dpm_suspend() and
suspend_nvs_save() in order when the system enters into hibernation.
It also calls suspend_nvs_restore() and dpm_resume() in order when the
system exits from hibernation. So, no race condition occurs while
hibernation, and we always guarantee the contents of buffers as we
expect.

2) The unexpected behavior of the TPM device.
If nvs.c saves and restores the contents of the TPM CRB buffers while
hibernation, it may occur the unexpected behavior of the TPM device
because the buffers are used to control the TPM device. When the
system entered into hibernation, suspend_nvs_save() saved the command
and response buffers, and they had the last command and response data.
After exiting from hibernation, suspend_nvs_restore() restored the
last command and response data into the buffers and nothing happened.
I realized that they were just buffers. If we want to send a command
to the TPM device, we have to set the CRB_START_INVOKE bit to a
control_start register of a control area. The control area was not in
the ACPI NVS area, so it was not affected by nvs.c file. We can
guarantee the behavior of the TPM device.

Because of these two reasons, I agreed on Jarkko's idea in
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/29/962 . It seems that removing or
changing regions described in the ACPI table is not natural after
setup. In my view, saving and restoring buffers was OK like other NVS
areas were expected because the buffers were in ACPI NVS area.

So, I made and sent this patch series. I would like to solve this
AMD's fTPM problem because I have been doing research on TPM and this
problem is critical for me (as you know fTPM doesn't work). If you
have any other concern or advice on the patch I made, please let me
know.

Yes, you are right. However, crb_fixup_cmd_size() function have worked
for handling broken BIOS well. I meant if we changed the function to
trust control register, we may need to test all broken BIOS the
function covered. To solve AMD's fTPM case, supporting separated
command and response buffers was enough. If your concern is the buffer
size calculation and you would like to solve it, I would make another
patch after this one.

First of all, I misunderstood your message.
I have to tell you about the buffer size exactly. The command and
response buffer sizes in ACPI table were 0x1000 and this was 4K, not
1K. The sizes in the control register were 0x4000 and this was 16K
(large buffer size), not 4K.
I have been using the TPM for my research and the typical cases like
creating public/private keys, encrypting/decrypting data,
sealing/unsealing a secrete, and getting random numbers are not over
4K buffer. So, as you know, I think the 4K buffer can handle the most
cases and the current implementation of crb_fixup_cmd_size() works
well. If you concern the specific case that uses over 4K buffer,
please let me know.

If you have more ideas and advice on this patch, please let me know. I
will improve my patch.
