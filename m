This was rather an example of a big project. Other big projects may be
closed source, of course.

And yes, with regard to FF specifically I think nothing prevents it from
being modified appropriately.

Yup, I see now. Since you are aware of ongoing intentions, please do Cc
those people then and/or let me know about previous discussions please.
