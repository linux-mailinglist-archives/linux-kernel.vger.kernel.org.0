Sure.

For now I really just want to move the code around.  As Jason pointed
out the flow will need some major rework, and I'd rather not mess
with little things like this for now.  Especially as I assume Jerome
must have an update to the proper API ready given that he both
wrote that new API and the nouveau code.

Ok.

Yes, probably.

Indeed.

I don't think so, we can remove that.

Yes, in the long run this all needs a major cleanup..

It should if I were trying to fix this.  But this is just code
inspection and I don't even have the hardware, so I'll have to leave
that for someone who can do real development on the driver.
