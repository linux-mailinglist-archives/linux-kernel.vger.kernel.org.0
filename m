Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] KVM: selftests: Introduce VM_MODE_PXXV48_4K
Date:   Thu, 29 Aug 2019 10:21:13 +0800

v2:
- pick r-bs
- rebased to master
- fix pa width detect, check cpuid(1):edx.PAE(bit 6)
- fix arm compilation issue [Drew]
- fix indents issues and ways to define macros [Drew]
- provide functions for fetching cpu pa/va bits [Drew]

This series originates from "[PATCH] KVM: selftests: Detect max PA
width from cpuid" [1] and one of Drew's comments - instead of keeping
the hackish line to overwrite guest_pa_bits all the time, this series
introduced the new mode VM_MODE_PXXV48_4K for x86_64 platform.

The major issue is that even all the x86_64 kvm selftests are
currently using the guest mode VM_MODE_P52V48_4K, many x86_64 hosts
are not using 52 bits PA (and in most cases, far less).  If with luck
we could be having 48 bits hosts, but it's more adhoc (I've observed 3
x86_64 systems, they are having different PA width of 36, 39, 48).  I
am not sure whether this is happening to the other archs as well, but
it probably makes sense to bring the x86_64 tests to the real world on
always using the correct PA bits.

A side effect of this series is that it will also fix the crash we've
encountered on Xeon E3-1220 as mentioned [1] due to the
differenciation of PA width.

With [1], we've observed AMD host issues when with NPT=off.  However a
funny fact is that after I reworked into this series, the tests can
instead pass on both NPT=on/off.  It could be that the series changes
vm->pa_bits or other fields so something was affected.  I didn't dig
more on that though, considering we should not lose anything.
