David,

If anyone is trying to rely on prandom_u32() as being "strong" in any
sense of the word in terms of being reversable by attacker --- they
shouldn't be using prandom_u32().  That's going to be true no matter
*what* algorithm we use.

Better distribution?  Sure.  Making prandom_u32() faster?  Absolutely;
that's its primary Raison d'Etre.

George,

Did you send the full set of patches to a single mailing list?  Or can
you make it available on a git tree somewhere?  I've y seen this
message plus the ext4 related change, and I can't find the full patch
series anywhere.  If you can send the next version such that it's
fully cc'ed to linux-kernel, that would be really helpful.

Thanks!!
