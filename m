OK, I don't mind changing it.  Does this look OK?  I have to submit a v2 anyway
for the first patch.

    net: macb: Kconfig: Rename Atmel to Cadence

    The help text makes it look like NET_VENDOR_CADENCE enables support for
    Atmel devices, when in reality it's a driver written by Atmel that
    supports Cadence devices.  This may confuse users that have this device
    on a non-Atmel SoC.

    The fix is just s/Atmel/Cadence/, but I did go and re-wrap the Kconfig
    help text as that change caused it to go over 80 characters.
