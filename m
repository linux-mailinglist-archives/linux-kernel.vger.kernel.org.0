Ah, the broken promises of ACPI on ARM64. I wonder how long it will take
before a public acknowledgement that it was a bad idea. Bad ideas happen
and can be forgiven, but stubborness in claiming it was the right
decision is another story.

(Not that you can be blamed for this of course :-))

If you can't control the initial boot loader, then I see two options,
none of which you will like I'm afraid.

- As you pass the DT to Linux from grub, there's your intermediate boot
  loader where you can construct a valid DT.

- If the ACPI cult needs to be venerated, then drivers should be
  converted to support ACPI without the need for DT.

A possible a middleground could be a platform driver (in
drivers/firmware/efi/ ? in drivers/platform/ ?) that will patch the DT
to instantiate the right panel based on the information retrieved from
the boot loader. We will need something similar for the Intel IPU3
camera driver, as Intel decided to come up with two different ACPI
"bindings", one for Windows and one for Chrome OS, leaving Windows
machine impossible to handle from a kernel driver due to required
information being hardcoded in Windows drivers shipped by Intel. This is
thus an option that may (unfortunately) need to become more widespread
for ACPI-based systems.

That doesn't however justify not going for the best solution we can
achieve. What do you like best in the above ? :-)
