Steven's stuck in the middle of things here, but I do object to p?d_large()
because I find it bonkers to have p?d_large() and p?d_huge() mean completely
different things when they are synonyms in the English language.

Yes, p?d_leaf() matches the terminology used by the Arm architecture, but
given that most page table structures are arranged as a 'tree', then it's
not completely unreasonable, in my opinion. If you have a more descriptive
name, we could use that instead. We could also paint it blue.

Alternatively, it means we have a good opportunity to give it a better name
before it spreads into the core code.

Again, I disagree and think p?d_large() should be confined to arch code
if it sticks around at all.

I don't usually care much about naming, but in this case I really find
the status quo needlessly confusing.
