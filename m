Yes I agree.  I would appreciate if either Andrea or any of the other
mm experts can comment on this patchset.

If the question was about the userspace signal handling - IMHO it's
not really a latency number that I can measure, but it's some
functional difference just like what dfa37dc3fc1f6f wanted to solve
previously (though that solution seemed to be causing some other issue
like what have been mentioned in the cover letter on invalid VMA
access), while this series should be a cleaner approach.

To be clear about the functional differnce: if without the userspace
non-fatal handling patch in this series ("mm: Return faster for
non-fatal signals in user mode faults"), we can't use Ctrl-C to stop a
program hanging in handle_userfault(), nor can we use gdb to attach to
that process (we can do it if with dfa37dc3fc1f6f, but again it's not
the clean approach).  And, if with this whole series (hence with "mm:
Return faster for non-fatal signals in user mode faults"), we can do
both (Ctrl-C to stop the process, or gdb attaching to that hanging
process without hanging gdb).

Hmm seems to be a valid point... IMHO it'll be fine for non-fatal
signals, because GUPs will still be without FAULT_FLAG_INTERRUPTIBLE
when calling handle_mm_fault(), hence the page fault logic should at
least ignore non-fatal signals.  However I agree that we probably need
a check for fatal signals in __get_user_pages_locked() now.
