Let me try this again -
1. We boot a 16 vcpu guest, the guest kernel writes the LDR for the CPUs but
ofcourse, PhysFlat is always used.

2. We force a kdump crash - the kdump kernel boots with nr_cpus=1 but that does not
make KVM forget about the inactive vcpus. They are still in the vcpu list but not
active.

3. Before jumping into the kdump kernel, the guest kernel does not clear the LDR bits.

4. In the kdump kernel, the guest only overwrites the LDR for the boot cpu i.e from
KVM's point of view, the stale LDR values are still around for the inactive vcpus.

5. recalculate_apic_map() in its previous form (before the kvm patch linked above) did
not check whether the virtual apic is actually enabled; rather, if it finds any value in
the LDR, it will keep the cpu in the mapping table it maintains. However, it makes the
assumption that only one bit in the LDR is set which is not true for bigsmp_init_apic_ldr() -
the way it initializes the LDR, multiple bits can be set! Since recalculate_apic_map uses
ffs() it just checks for the first set bit and assumes that other bits are set and potentially
overwrites and existing entry.

For example, let's assume the kdump kernel boots on CPU 1. So, in recalculate_apic_map(),
mask is 1 and ffs(mask) - 1 is 0 and so, cluster[ffs(mask) - 1] = apic; writes 1 to
cluster[0]. When iterating through all the vcpus, the next in line is vcpu2 which still has
a stale LDR value. So, the function will again incorrectly overwrite cluster[0] = 2. Since 2
is inactive, the timer calibration interrupt ends up nowhere.

So, in KVM: if we make sure that the logical destination map isn't filled up if the virtual
apic is not enabled by software, it really doesn't matter whether the LDR for an inactive CPU
has a stale value.

In x86/apic: if we make sure that the LDR is 0 or reset, recalculate_apic_map() will never consider
including this cpu in the logical map.

In short, as I mentioned in the patch description, this is really a KVM bug but it doesn't hurt
to clear out the LDR in the guest and then, it wouldn't need a hypervisor fix.

Is this better ?
