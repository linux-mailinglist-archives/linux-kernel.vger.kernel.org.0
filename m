I do agree that configuring the reclaim protection is not an easy task.
Especially in a deeper reclaim hierarchy. systemd tends to create a deep
and commonly shared subtrees. So having a protected workload really
requires to be put directly into a new first level cgroup in practice
AFAICT. That is a simpler example though. Just imagine you want to
protect a certain user slice.

You seem to be facing a different problem though IIUC. You know how much
memory you want to protect and you do not have to care about the cgroup
hierarchy up but you do not know/care how to distribute that protection
among workloads running under that protection. I agree that this is a
reasonable usecase.

Those both problems however show that we have a more general
configurability problem for both leaf and intermediate nodes. They are
both a result of strong requirements imposed by delegation as you have
noted above. I am thinking didn't we just go too rigid here?

Delegation points are certainly a security boundary and they should
be treated like that but do we really need a strong containment when
the reclaim protection is under admin full control? Does the admin
really have to reconfigure a large part of the hierarchy to protect a
particular subtree?

I do not have a great answer on how to implement this unfortunately. The
best I could come up with was to add a "$inherited_protection" magic
value to distinguish from an explicit >=0 protection. What's the
difference? $inherited_protection would be a default and it would always
refer to the closest explicit protection up the hierarchy (with 0 as a
default if there is none defined).
        A
       / \
      B   C (low=10G)
         / \
        D   E (low = 5G)

A, B don't get any protection (low=0). C gets protection (10G) and
distributes the pressure to D, E when in excess. D inherits (low=10G)
and E overrides the protection to 5G.

That would help both usecases AFAICS while the delegation should be
still possible (configure the delegation point with an explicit
value). I have very likely not thought that through completely.  Does
that sound like a completely insane idea?

Or do you think that the two usecases are simply impossible to handle
at the same time?
