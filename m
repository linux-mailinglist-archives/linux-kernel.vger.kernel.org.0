I was pursuing this bug without knowledged of your patch. Your patch
makes it harder to see. Clearly in my test case, it disappears, but it is
just because of the multiplexing interval. If we get to the rotate code
and we have no active events yet some inactive, there is something
wrong because we are wasting counters. When I tracked the bug,
I started from the remove_context code, then realized there was also
the disable case. I fixed both and they I discovered your patch which
is fixing it at the receiving end. Hopefully, there aren't any code path
that can lead to this situation.

It does not really fix your patch, I think we can keep it as a double
precaution. It fixes
the causes. I think it is useful to check beyond the active in the
rotate code as well.
