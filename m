Date:   Thu, 21 Nov 2019 04:24:30 +0100
Message-Id: <1574306670-30234-1-git-send-email-krzk@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.7.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Adjust indentation from spaces to tab (+optional two spaces) as in
coding style with command like:
	$ sed -e 's/^        /\t/' -i */Kconfig
