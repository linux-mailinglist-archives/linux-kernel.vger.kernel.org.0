FWIW, I have an actual use case for mounting over a symlink: replacing /etc/=
resolv.conf.  My virtme tool is presented with somewhat arbitrary crud in /e=
tc, where /etc/resolv.conf might be a plain file or a symlink, but, regardle=
ss, has inappropriate contents. If it=E2=80=99s a file, I can mount a new fi=
le over it. If it=E2=80=99s a symlink and the kernel properly supported it, I=
 could also mount over it.

Yes, I could also use overlayfs.  Maybe I should regardless.
