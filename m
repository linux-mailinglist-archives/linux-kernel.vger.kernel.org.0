Adding Duncan Laurie who I think has some more intimate knowledge
of how this is implemented in HW. Duncan, could you correct or elaborate
on my answers below as you see fit? Also, sorry if I make some beginner
mistakes here, I'm just getting familiar with the USB subsystem, and thanks for
your patience.

It does not use the standard hub commands. The USB ports are controlled
by an Embedded Controller (EC), so to control this policy we send a command
to the EC. Since the command to send to the EC is very specific, this would need
to go into a "hub driver" unique for these Wilco devices. We would make it so
that the normal hub registration is intercepted by something that sees this is a
Wilco device, and instead register the hub as a "wilco-hub", which has its own
special "power_share" sysfs attribute, but still is treated as a normal USB hub
otherwise?

The EC twiddles something in the port' HW so that the port turns into a
DCP (Dedicated Charging Port) and only supplies power, not data. So I
think yes, this is a bit of a hack that does not conform to the spec.

[I'm not sure I'm answering your question, but] I believe that we could
make the BIOS firmware describe the USB ports' capabilities, and the
kernel's behavior would be gated upon what the firmware reports. I see
that struct usb_port already contains a "quirks" field, should we add a
POWER_SHARE quirk to include/linux/usb/quirks.h? I would guess that
should that should be reserved for quirks shared between many USB
devices/hubs?

Thanks,
Nick
