Hm, you're not the Leo Li that participated in this thread
<https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/AM3PR04MB11857AE8D2B0BE56121B97D391C90@AM3PR04MB1185.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com/T/#u>?


 Can you give an example on how is it used on ARM system?

LS1021A, for example, which is the one I'm aiming for getting fully
supported in mainline.
<https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/layerscape-communication-process/qoriq-layerscape-1021a-dual-core-communications-processor-with-lcd-controller:LS1021A>

The forks at https://github.com/qoriq-open-source/linux.git have various
degrees of support (grep for commits saying stuff like "remove PPCisms"
- some versions can be found on
<https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/?q=remove+ppcisms>). Our current kernel is
based on commits from the now-vanished 4.1 branch, and unfortunately at
least the 4.14 branch (LSDK-18.06-V4.14) trivially doesn't build on ARM,
despite the PPC32 dependency having been removed from CONFIG_QUICC_ENGINE.

True, of course. This is just some first few steps, and I'm not claiming
that this is sufficient to make the QE drivers build on ARM yet. But I
have a customer with both mpc8309-based and ls1021a-based platforms, and
they want to run the same, as-close-to-mainline-as-possible, kernel on
both. So I will take a piecemeal approach, and try to make sure I don't
break the ppc boards in the process (just building and booting one board
is of course not sufficient, but better than nothing). Once I get to
actually build some of the QE drivers for ARM, I'll of course also test
them.
