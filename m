Hi Petr,

AndreaP responded with some explanation (and great links!) on the topic
of READ_ONCE. But I feel like your comments about the WRITE_ONCE were
not addressed. I address that (and your other comments) below...

The cmpxchg_release() ensures that if the node is visible to writers,
then the finalized assignment is also visible. And the store_release()
ensures that if the previous node is visible to any readers, then the
finalized assignment is also visible. In the reader case, if any readers
happen to be sitting on the node, numlist_read() will fail because the
ID was updated when the node was popped. So for all these cases any
compiler optimizations leading to that assigment (tearing, speculation,
etc) should be irrelevant. Therefore, IMO the WRITE_ONCE() is not
needed.

Since all of this is lockless, I used WRITE_ONCE() whenever touching
shared variables. I must admit the decision may be motivated primarily
by fear of compiler optimizations. Although "documenting lockless shared
variable access" did play a role as well.

I will replace the WRITE_ONCE with an assignment.

You are correct. The cpu_relax() should not be there. But there is still
an issue that this could spin hard if the head was recycled and this CPU
does not yet see the new head value.

To handle that, and in preparation for my next version, I'm now using a
read_acquire() to load the ID in the node() callback (matching the
set_release() in assign_desc()). This ensures that if numlist_read()
fails, the new head will be visible.

Agreed.

For the same reasons as the other WRITE_ONCE, I will replace the
WRITE_ONCE with an assignment.

OK.

Yes, it is a lot, but bF and bG are commenting on different things. bF
is the explanation that the _writer_ will overwrite the previous node's
terminating value with the ID of the new node. bG is the explanation
that if the _reader_ reads a non-terminating @next_id value, then the
initialization of @seq and @next_id for that next node will be visible.

Both of these points are key to the numlist implementation because they
guarantee the complete and correct linking of the list for all nodes
pushed.
