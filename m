When you change things in the future, Linux gets to keep supporting
both ways of doing things? I'd rather just support one way.

I'd agree if the DAI was fully described in the DT.

I would think about how the DT will look when the DSP manages all
these resources itself and how the kernel drivers evolve. I think
perhaps if you can get rid of the DT part and just define the
resources in the driver, then the future transition would be easier.

There's an upper limit in the h/w so there should be some sort of limit.

Sounds like a kernel-userspace issue that has nothing to do with DT.
How do other platforms deal with mulitple DAIs?
