I think you're focussing on the use of the end-to-end translations by
architecturally executed instructions, while Catalin is describing
problems resulting from the use of intermediate translations by
speculative walks.

The concern here is that speculation can result in intermediate walk
entries in the TLB being used to continue page table walks, and these
walks can have side-effects regardless of whether the resulting entires
are consumed by architecturally executed instructions.

For example, say we free a PMD page for which there is a stale
intermediate entry in a TLB, and that page gets reallocated for
arbitrary date. A speculative walk can consume that data as-if it were a
PMD, and depending on the value it sees a number of things can happen.
If the value happens to point at MMIO, the MMU might read from that MMIO
with side-effects. If the value happens to contain an architecturally
invalid configuration the result can be CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE and
not limited to the corresponding ASID.

Even if the resulting end-to-end translation is never architecturally
consumed there are potential problems here, and I think that this series
is assuming stronger-than-architected behaviour from the MMU and page
table walks.

I'm not certain if the architecture generally allows or forbids walks to
be continued for an ASID that is not live in a TTBR, but there are cases
where that is possible, so I don't think the above accurately captures
the situation. Stale intermediate entries can certainly be consumed in
some cases.

I understand the point you're making, but please don't overload the
terminology. Break-Before-Make is a well-defined term which refers to a
specific sequence which includes TLB invalidation, and the above is not
a break per that definition.

I think the important thing is that this is not necessarily safe. The
architecture currently states that a Break-Before-Make sequence is
necessary, and this series does not follow that.

AFAICT, this series relies on:

* An ISB completing prior page table walks when updating TTBR. I don't
  believe this is necessarily the case, given how things work for an
  EL1->EL2 transition where there can be ongoing EL1 walks.

* Walks never being initiated for `inactive` contexts within the current
  translation regime. e.g. while ASID x is installed, never starting a
  walk for ASID y. I can imagine that the architecture may permit a form
  of this starting with intermediate walk entries in the TLBs.

Before we can say whether this series is safe, we'd need to have a
better description of how a PE may use `inactive` values for an
in-context translation regime. 

I've asked for some clarification on these points.

Thanks,
Mark.
