I believe we're all on the same page in the sense that we all want the
"simplest approach possible", but there's a sliding scale of complexity
between the kernel and userspace.  We can make life simple for userspace
at the cost of additional complexity in the kernel, and vice versa.  The
disagreement is over where to shove the extra complexity.

This is effectively #1, e.g. would require userspace to pre-declare its
intent to make regions W->X.
