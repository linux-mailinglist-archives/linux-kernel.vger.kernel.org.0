I don't think non blocking read/writes will work for us. We do
coverage-guided fuzzing and need to collect coverage for each syscall.
In the USB case "syscall" means processing a USB request from start to
end, and thus we need to wait until the kernel finishes processing it,
otherwise we'll fail to associate coverage properly (It's actually a
bit more complex, as we collect coverage for the whole initial
enumeration process as for one "syscall", but the general idea stands,
that we need to wait until the operation finishes.)

I'm not sure I really get this part. We'll still need to call
copy_from_user() and usb_ep_queue() once per each operation/request.
How does it get amortized? Or do you mean that having multiple
requests queued will allow USB controller to process them in bulk?
This makes sense, but again, we"ll then have an issue with coverage
association.

See response to #1, if we prequeue requests, then the kernel will
start handling them before we do read(), and we'll fail to associate
coverage properly. (This will also require adding another ioctl to
imitate set_alt(), like the USB_RAW_IOCTL_CONFIGURE that we have.)

Overall, supporting O_NONBLOCK might be a useful feature for people
who are doing something else other than fuzzing, We can account for
potential future extensions that'll support it, so detecting
O_NONBLOCK and returning an error for now makes sense.

WDYT?

Thanks!
