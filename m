Segfault with no mm means that a (not fixable) pagefault happened while
kernel code ran.

In contrast to classic x86, without KPTI and SMAP/SMEP, UML has a strong
separation between user- and kernel-memory. This is also why copy_from/to_user()
is so expensive.

In arch/um/kernel/trap.c segv() you can see the logic.
Also see UPT_IS_USER().
