Let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly: when an enclave
tries to execute code, it only works if *both* the EPCM and the page
tables grant the access, right?  This seems to be that 37.3 is trying
to say.  So we should probably just ignore SECINFO for these purposes.

But thinking this all through, it's a bit more complicated than any of
this.  Looking at the SELinux code for inspiration, there are quite a
few paths, but they boil down to two cases: EXECUTE is the right to
map an unmodified file executably, and EXECMOD/EXECMEM (the
distinction seems mostly irrelevant) is the right to create (via mmap
or mprotect) a modified anonymous file mapping or a non-file-backed
mapping that is executable.  So, if we do nothing, then mapping an
enclave with execute permission will require either EXECUTE on the
enclave inode or EXECMOD/EXECMEM, depending on exactly how this gets
set up.

So all is well, sort of.  The problem is that I expect there will be
people who want enclaves to work in a process that does not have these
rights.  To make this work, we probably need do some surgery on
SELinux.  ISTM the act of copying (via the EADD ioctl) data from a
PROT_EXEC mapping to an enclave should not be construed as "modifying"
the enclave for SELinux purposes.  Actually doing this could be
awkward, since the same inode will have executable parts and
non-executable parts, and SELinux can't really tell the difference.

Maybe the enclave should track a bitmap of which pages have ever been
either mapped for write or EADDed with a *source* that wasn't
PROT_EXEC.  And then SELinux could learn to allow those pages (and
only those pages) to be mapped executably without EXECUTE or EXECMOD
or whatever permission.

Does this seem at all reasonable?

I suppose it's not the end of the world if the initially merged
version doesn't do this, as long as there's some reasonable path to
adding a mechanism like this when there's demand for it.
