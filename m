Yes, it is an option. Since __page_cache_release() is called by 
__put_single_page() too, so mem_cgroup_uncharge() has to be called in 
both __put_single_page() and the desctructor (free_compound_page() which 
is called by both THP and other compound page except HugeTLB). But, it 
sounds acceptable IMHO.
