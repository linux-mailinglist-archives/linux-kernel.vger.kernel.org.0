Those two patches work well for some workloads (like the benchmark),
but not for others. The full patchset makes sure both types work well.

Specifically, the existing aging strategy for anon assumes that most
anon pages allocated are hot. That's why they all start active and we
then do second-chance with the small inactive LRU to filter out the
few cold ones to swap out. This is true for many common workloads.

The benchmark creates a larger-than-memory set of anon pages with a
flat access profile - to the VM a flood of one-off pages. Joonsoo's
first two patches allow the VM to usher those pages in and out of
memory very quickly, which explains the throughput boost. But it comes
at the cost of reducing space available to hot anon pages, which will
regress others.

Joonsoo's full patchset makes the VM support both types of workloads
well: by putting everything on the inactive list first, one-off pages
can move through the system without disturbing the hot pages. And by
supplementing the inactive list with non-resident information, he can
keep it tiny without the risk of one-off pages drowning out new hot
pages. He can retain today's level of active page protection and
detection, while allowing one-off pages to move through quickly.
