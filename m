I'd noticed that but it appears to be a spurious checkpatch warning.
The line is 73 chars long, the same as the first line of the commit
description.  Maybe the quotes throw it off?

I didn't change that error string because it's in an unmodified existing
function that I moved above the caller so a declaration wasn't required.
All other examples in the file are the same.  I'm of course happy to
change it in this function if you think it's appropriate to do so.

I see it done different ways, mostly without the path, even for the TPM
drivers.  For example, there's no path in Stefan's "[PATCH v7 2/3] tpm:
ibmvtpm: Wait for buffer to be set before proceeding."  I'm certainly
happy to change it, however, and it's good to know that's the preferred
style going forward.

Separate topic:  Since this fixes a migration hang, do you think it
should also be cc'd to stable?
