"it is clear that we can not expand command-line options" needs a fuller
explanation.  And maybe further exploration.

Devicetree is standardized and documented as hardware description.

Devicetree is NOT for configuration information.  This has been discussed
over and over again in mail lists, at various conferences, and was also an
entire session at plumbers a few years ago:

   https://elinux.org/Device_tree_future#Linux_Plumbers_2016_Device_Tree_Track

There is one part of device tree that does allow non-hardware description,
which is the "chosen" node which is provided to allow communication between
the bootloader and the kernel.

There clearly are many use cases for providing configuration information
and other types of data to a booting kernel.  I have been encouraging
people to come up with an additional boot time communication channel or
data object to support this use case.  So far, no serious proposal that
I am aware of.

No.  Sorry.

My understanding of this proposal is that it is intended to better
support boot time kernel and driver debugging.  As an alternate
implementation, could you compile the ftrace configuration information
directly into a kernel data structure?  It seems like it would not be
very difficult to populate the data structure data via a few macros.
