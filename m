Another thing that I implied by "not supporting" but want to explicitly
call out is that currently Xen will refuse reserving any MCFG area
unless it actually existed in MCFG table at boot. I don't clearly
understand reasoning behind it but it might be worth relaxing at least
size matching restriction on Xen side now with this change.
