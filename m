Thanks!
We all know how it is to be busy, especially when trying to keep up
after role changes.
Unless someone beats me, then I will apply tonight or tomorrow.

Hi John

Up to the challenge?
If yes then please consider to apply for commit rights to drm-misc-next.

And read:
https://drm.pages.freedesktop.org/maintainer-tools/index.html

See this to get an account:
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/AccountRequests/

You will need an ssh account for drm-misc-next as it is not (yet?)
gitlab enabled.

	Sam
