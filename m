I was representing the current code and the discussion we were having.
If we apply the patch I suggested earlier then we'll make this into a
'Y'.

I thought your code fell into the first case though; NULL fw_name and
index >=3D 0, so we do the DT lookup and everything blows up because that
parent isn't the one expected.

We use the fw_name and if that isn't provided, then we use the index.
This is how the logic was written for DT parsing of clks originally, so
I'm just continuing the same logic (see of_parse_clkspec() for more
details).

Yeah, this part. I think it's fine to do this.

Ok. So you have a mixture of some parents with only the legacy name and
then other clks with some parents in the new style? As long as we
understand each other I think we'll figure it out.

Agreed, but you've implicitly defined the .fw_name to NULL and the
.index to 0, so you're insisting that an index of 0 should be used,
albeit implicitly so.

Hmmm I made the assumption that if you were going to use the new
structure that you would be using "clock-names" (.fw_name) or an index
for everything and then falling back to .name for legacy migration
reasons. I didn't really consider that a mix of .name and .fw_name
would be used for different parent indices.

We'll only try the legacy name if all else fails. We're hoping that
.fw_name or .hw is used instead because those are faster than string
comparisons on the entire tree.

Yes.

>=20

Let's expand the table.

    .fw_name   |  .index |  .name      | DT lookup? | fallback to legacy?=20
   +-----------+---------+-------------+----+----------------------------
 1 | NULL      |    >=3D 0 |  NULL       |    Y       |         N
 2 | NULL      |    -1   |  NULL       |    N       |         N
 3 | non-NULL  |    -1   |  NULL       |    Y       |         N
 4 | non-NULL  |    >=3D 0 |  NULL       |    Y       |         N
 5 | NULL      |    >=3D 0 |  non-NULL   |    Y       |         Y
 6 | NULL      |    -1   |  non-NULL   |    N       |         Y
 7 | non-NULL  |    -1   |  non-NULL   |    Y       |         Y
 8 | non-NULL  |    >=3D 0 |  non-NULL   |    Y       |         Y

And then if .hw is set we just don't even try to use the above table.

You want case #5 to skip the DT lookup because .fw_name is NULL, but the
index is 0. I stared at this for a few minutes and I think you're
arguing that we should only do the DT lookup when index is 0 if we can't
fallback to a legacy lookup.

Initially that sounds OK, but then we'll get stuck with legacy lookups
forever if someone doesn't put a matching .fw_name into the
'clock-names' property. We don't want that to happen. We want to get off
legacy and into the new world where either .fw_name or .index is used to
specify a parent.

From my perspective you're suffering from static initializers setting
everything to 0 and that making the index 0 and "valid" for a DT lookup
hitting up against not wanting to set anything in the structure
unnecessarily. While at the same time, it's great that .fw_name is set
to NULL by the static initializer, so it's a case of wanting the same
thing to do different things.

If we would have made it so the DT index started at 1 then this wouldn't
be a problem, but that's not possible. Or if we would have made a new
clk flag that said CLK_USE_INDEX_FOR_DT then it could have gotten over
this problem but that's basically the same as making the inverse set of
drivers use -1 for the index to indicate they don't want a DT lookup.

I still believe the large majority of clk drivers will either use .hw or
.fw_name to find parents, while falling back to the .name for legacy
reasons. The .index field won't see much use, but we'll support it for
the firmwares out there that don't use "clock-names". Similarly, we'll
have only a handful of drivers that only want to specify .name and
nothing else, and those few drivers can use .index =3D -1 to overcome
this.

We need to support DTBs that don't specify "clock-names". The
"clock-names" property isn't mandatory, just strongly recommended, and
we have various bits of code like the fixed factor clk that don't expect
to see a name, just use some index like 0 to get the parent clk. I don't
want to go retroactively force a bunch of DT to get "clock-names"
properties in them so that they can work with the new style of parents.
And I don't want them to be stuck calling of_clk_parent_fill() or
of_clk_get() to parse that index and grab the clk name out during
registration.
