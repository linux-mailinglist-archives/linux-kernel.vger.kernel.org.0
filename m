I see. My PoC patch was not too off then ;)
So the plan is to have a generic implementation for all of the
architecture, right?

I'm still not convinced, the point of the DMA mask, at least how I see
it, to check that the dma address can be handled by the device (DMA,
peripheral with built in DMA, etc), it is not against physical address.
Doing phys_to_dma() on the mask from the dma_set_mask() is just wrong.

Hehe, I see.
I genuinely curious why k2 platform worked just fine with LPAE (it needs
it), but guys had issues with LPAE on dra7/am5.
The fix for dra7/am5 broke k2.
As far as I can see the main (only) difference is that k2 have
dma_pfn_offset = 0x780000, while dra7/am5 have it 0 (really direct mapping).

Right, so skipping phys_to_dma() for the mask and believing that it will
work..

It does: audio and dmatest memcpy tests are just fine with this, MMC
also probed with ADMA enabled.

As far as I can tell it works as well as falling back to the old arm ops
in case of LPAE && dma_pfn_offset != 0

Fwiw:

Would you be comfortable to send apply this patch to mainline with
Fixes: ad3c7b18c5b3 ("arm: use swiotlb for bounce buffering on LPAE
configs")

So it gets picked for stable kernels as well?
