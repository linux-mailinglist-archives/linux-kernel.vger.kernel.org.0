Why did you remove this module?  That never happens unless you do it "by
hand", and as root.  Just don't do this if it causes problems in your
system, right?

Anyway, if you create a child reference you should always clean up all
of your children before removing yourself from memory.  So try fixing
that up first.

Don't unload kernel modules unless you know what you are doing :)

Seriously, you are creating a dependancy here that you are not
expressing in your module reference count, and you are not properly
cleaning up after yourself when removing your devices.  Just delete your
child devices when unloading yourself and you should be fine, right?

I don't know how your resource management logic works, try working with
the developers who wrote that.  But as you describe it, it is not
correct at least when you try to clean things up.

thanks,
