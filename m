I assume you refer to mmc_sd_hw_reset()? In that case, I think you
have interpreted the purpose of mmc_sd_hw_reset() slightly wrong. It's
responsibility is to reset the SD-card and not the host/controller.

Whether there some additional "reset" of the controller needed, that
is assumed by the core, to be managed via the ->set_ios() callback for
the host.

This sounds like host specific problems, which most likely should be
fixed in host driver, solely. Unless I am missing something, of
course.

When doing a  mmc_hw_reset() (which ends up calling mmc_sd_hw_reset()
in case of SD cards), we are making a final attempt to make the card
functional again, via a power cycle and a re-init of it.

In this path, we don't care whether the card is removed, as that
should have been detected already when the block layer calls
mmc_detect_card_removed().
