Hi Pavel,

Thanks for reporting this. This is a very nasty bug.

I see that with CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN=y, this means that we may
leave the stale TTBR0 value installed across a context-switch (and have
reproduced that locally), but I'm having some difficulty reproducing the
corruption that you see.

IIUC this tickles the issue by performing a faulting uaccess in IRQ
context. On the path to returnign from the exception, it directly calls
into the scheduler as part of el1_preempt, erroneously passing the TTBR0
value to the next task. Note that a preemption would remove the stale
TTBR0 value as part of kernel entry.

It looks like if we're in this state, and return from an exception taken
from EL1 with SW PAN enabled, we'll also leave the stale TTBR0 value
installed. If PAN was disabled (e.g. in the middle of a uaccess region),
then we'll restore the correct TTBR0.

Can you provide the whole test, please? And precisely how you're
launching it?

I've tried turning the above into a main() function, and spawning a
number of instances in parallel while perf is running, but I haven't
been able to reproduce the issue locally, and I'm concerned that I'm
missing something.

How often is "from time to time"? How many processes are you running,
across how many CPUs?

FWIW, the diff below looks correct to me, but we might want to fold this
into the C wrappers, so that this is consistent with the other uaccess
cases (and done in one place in the code).

Thanks,
Mark.
