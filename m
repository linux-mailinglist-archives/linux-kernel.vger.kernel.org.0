That's the first I did when I started to forward port this patch from chromeos
kernel to mainline.

On my system I get:

/sys/firmware/acpi/tables#
APIC  DSDT  FACP  FACS  HPET  MCFG  SSDT  data  dynamic

(data and dynamic are empty directories)

I quickly concluded (maybe wrong) that as there is no a MLST entry it was not
exported, but maybe one of those already contains the info? Or, should I expect
a MLST entry here?

I can't answer this question right now. I need to investigate more I guess ;-)

Thanks again for your answer,
