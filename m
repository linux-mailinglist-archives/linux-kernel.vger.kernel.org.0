Guest software, I presume.

Suggest to scratch "named crashloaded."

The whole file is rather terse.  I figure that's okay as along as
there's just "guest panicked", because "kernel panic" is obvious enough.
The addition of "panicked, handling with kexec" makes it less obvious.
The commit message provides a bit more guidance.  Could that be worked
into this file?
