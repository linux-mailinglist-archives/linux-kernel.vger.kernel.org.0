This looks highly dubious on first glance. The pwm subsystem nor
the Rockchip pwm driver do not do any pinctrl handling.

So I don't really see where that "active" pinctrl state is supposed
to come from.

Comparing with the pwm driver in the vendor tree I see that there
is such a state defined there. But that code there also looks strange
as that driver never again leaves this active state after entering it.

Also for example all the Gru devices run with quite a number of pwm-
regulators without needing additional fiddling with the pwm itself, so
I don't really see why that should be different here.
