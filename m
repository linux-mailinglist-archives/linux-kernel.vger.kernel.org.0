How much space are we talking about? Radix tree (resp. xarray) is a
small data structure and even when we have to allocate nodes dynamically
this doesn't sound like a huge overhead (especially with a small id
space). I might be missing something of course because I am not familiar
with this part the driver model and I would be interested what
maintainers think about that.

I will not really push for that but it is almost always better to
improve a common infrastructure rather than build up a dedicated
workarouns in some users. Especially when there are no strong arguments
for that.
