We found it easier to debug the programs if enforcement is disabled.
But we can remove this option if you feel strongly about it.

Even if the BPF LSM is LSM_ORDER_LAST this is still different from
adding a trampoline to the exit of the security hooks for a few other
reasons.

* We do need to initialize the BPF LSM as a proper LSM (i.e. in
  security/bpf) because it needs access to security blobs. This is
  only possible statically for now as they should be set after boot
  time to provide guarantees to any helper that uses information in
  security blobs. I have proposed how we could make this dynamic as a
  discussion topic for the BPF conference:

    https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20200127171516.GA2710@chromium.org

  As you can see from some of the prototype use cases e.g:

    https://github.com/sinkap/linux-krsi/blob/patch/v1/examples/samples/bpf/lsm_detect_exec_unlink.c

  that they do rely on security blobs and that they are key in doing
  meaningful security analysis.

* When using the semantic provided by fexit, the BPF LSM program will
  always be executed and will be able to override / clobber the
  decision of LSMs which appear before it in the ordered list. This
  semantic is very different from what we currently have (i.e. the BPF
  LSM hook is only called if all the other LSMs allow the action) and
  seems to be bypassing the LSM framework.

* Not all security_* wrappers simply call the attached hooks and return
  their exit code and not all of them pass the same arguments to the
  hook e.g. security_bprm_check, security_file_open,
  security_task_alloc to just name a few. Illustrating this further
  using security_task_alloc as an example:

	rc = call_int_hook(task_alloc, 0, task, clone_flags);
	if (unlikely(rc))
		security_task_free(task);
	return rc;

Which means we would leak task_structs in this case. While
call_int_hook is sort of equivalent to the fexit trampoline for most
hooks, it's not really the case for some (quite important) LSM hooks.
