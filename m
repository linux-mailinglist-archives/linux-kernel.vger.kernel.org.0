Not sure what you mean here, hopefully all the heaps can be "in-tree"
some day.

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10863957/

Plus some non-caching heaps and one that forces early allocation of our
PAT (gart like) IP.

All this stuff is going into our evil vendor tree next cycle (if not
upstream by then :)), if we want some of these "specialty" heaps to go
into generic kernel builds at some point they will need to be modules if
the core is.

Although I am still thinking Heaps should be always built in + system +
CMA heaps, then the rando heaps could be modules if needed.
