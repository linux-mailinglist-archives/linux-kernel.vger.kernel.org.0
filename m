I think you mean task_pt_regs(current) here.

One caveat is that for the idle threads, the initial SP overlaps the
task_pt_regs() area:

* __primary_switched starts SP at init_thread_union + THREAD_SIZE.

* __cpu_up() starts SP at task_stack_page(idle) + THREAD_SIZE.

... and in either case, sampling that would be bad.

For both arm, I believe similar holds true. AFAICT x86 seems to reserve
the regs area in its head_{64,32}.S, but I can't see what it does for
other threads.

Regardless, for arm, arm64, and x86, task_pt_regs(current) cannot be
NULL.

Thanks,
Mark.
