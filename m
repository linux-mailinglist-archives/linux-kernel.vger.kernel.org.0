Sounds good.

I am not sure that I get the full picture. It would help to see some
snippet of the code (struct declaration).

Anyway, adding void-pointer into struct numlist looks like classic
(userspace?) implementation of dynamically linked structures.

I do not have strong opinion. But I would prefer to stay with
the kernel-style. I mean that the numlist structure is part
of the linked structures. And container_of() is eventually
used to get pointer to the upper structure. Also passing values
via a pointer with generic name (data) slightly complicates the code.

I know that numlist is special because id is used to get the pointer
of the numlist and also the upper structure. Anyway, the kernel
style looks more familiar to me in the kernel context.
But I'll leave it up to you.

Would a check for NULL data pointer help here? Well, it might be
motivation for using the pointer.

I wonder if begin_lpos == end_lpos check might be used to detect
never used descriptors. It is already used in another situation
in dataring_desc_init(). IMHO, the values even do not need to be
unaligned. But I might miss something.
