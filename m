Hi Kees,

Thanks for the feedback!

Good suggestion!

I will do some analysis and come back with the numbers.

As Alexei mentioned, we can use the patches for static calls after
they are merged:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/8bc857824f82462a296a8a3c4913a11a7f801e74.1547073843.git.jpoimboe@redhat.com/

to make the framework better (as a separate series) especially given
that we are unsure how they work with BPF.
