Right, and I understand what you are asking, is just that I completely
disagree with you. But moving on.

Would you accept if I wrote a separate driver specific to pms405 or do
you want me to integrate in qcom-spmi_regulator.c?

I am asking because none of the ops will use the common functions (I
wont be reusing much code from this qcom-spmi_regulator.c file)
