That doesn't sound much better than my approach, but could also work.
One idea that I had but did not manage to implement was to move out
the snd_hdac_aligned_read/write functions from the core hda code
into a separate file. I think that would be the cleanest solution,
as it decouples the problem from any drivers.

I uploaded the .config to https://pastebin.com/raw/RMBGXTky
for reference now. This is with the latest linux-next kernel, plus
a series of patches that I keep around for fixing other build
problems.
