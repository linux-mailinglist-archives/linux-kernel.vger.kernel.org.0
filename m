Here's the details I know might be important:

Since this appears to be a problem with the result of a relocation not
fitting within 32 bits, I think the location chosen to place the crash
kernel needs to be above 4GiB; so you need a machine with more memory
than that.

At the moment I'm running SLES 12 sp 4 as the rest of the
environment.  rpm says kdump is kdump-0.8.16-9.2.x86_64.  I've fetched
the kernel sources and compiled directly on this system.  I believe I
copied the kernel config from the SLES kernel and did a make
olddefconfig for configuration.  Made and installed the kernel from
the kernel tree.

crashkernel=512M,high is set on the command line.

As the system boots, and systemd initializes kdump, it tries to load
the crash kernel, I believe through
/usr/lib/systemd/system/kdump.service running /lib/kdump/load.sh
--update.

Once that completes, 'systemctl status kdump' indicates a failure, and
dmesg | grep kexec shows the error messages mentioned above.

I will work through that tomorrow and let you know what I find.
