I remember one customer ever attached a picture of kernel booting hang
from monitor. I planned to disable vga when it's not specified, but
changed my mind because not all machines are servers w/o monitor. Still
there are many people using laptop, PC, they have vga printing, possibly
have no console. When crash happened, maybe randomly, the vga printing
could be the only witness. In above listed cases, case 1 doesn't output,
seems efi need be fixed, but I can't see why it matters here. About case
2, do you have a specific example, except of this one? Printing to vga
has been done so long time, if it does cause troubles, we need to mute
it now.
