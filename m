I finally messed with this a bit; it seems to do exactly what's written on
the box.

It seems to me that The Real Solutionâ„¢ here is to send a patch to the
Sphinx folks adding a "-jgmake" (or some such) option.  It also seems to
me that none of us is likely to get around to that in the near future.  So
I just applied this, thanks for dealing with all my picky comments...
