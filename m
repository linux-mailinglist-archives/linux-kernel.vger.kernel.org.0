Long story made short - the audit subsystem doesn't handle namespaces
or containers as well as it should.  Work is ongoing to add the
necessary support, but it isn't there yet and I don't want us to just
start removing restrictions until we have the proper support in place
(this what I alluded to with my "... when we get to the point that we
support multiple audit daemons, we can revisit this").
