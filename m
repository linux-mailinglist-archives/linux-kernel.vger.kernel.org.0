I'd say you're indeed trying to give a specific device special
treatment. ;)

No, the USB spec says bInterval is a maximum requested value and that
the host is free to poll more often. And that's policy.

The usb-hid driver actually supports configuring the polling rate
for devices like mice and keyboards after enumeration (through a module
parameter, but still).

Unfortunately, the xhci driver does not yet support this and always uses
the device maximum bInterval. A bug report for this was filed many years
ago, perhaps it's time to address that (adding Mathias on CC):
