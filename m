Hello,

Please make sure you Cc me in blkback related patches.

I think you can remove both comas in the above sentence.

I think it would be better if you could skip the filesystem overhead
by writing directly to a block device, ie:

Attach a null_blk based block device to the guest (on dom0):
# xl block-attach guest phy:/dev/null_blk0 xvdb w

Run a workload against the device (inside the guest):
# fio --filename=/dev/xvdb --direct=1 --rw=randrw --bs=4k --ioengine=libaio \
      --iodepth=64 --runtime=120 --numjobs=4 --time_based --group_reporting \
      --name=throughput-test-job --eta-newline=1

You should run this on a multi-vcpu guest so that multiple queues are
used, and adjust the numjobs to (at least) match the number of queues.

This is intriguing, as it seems to prove that the usage of a cache of
free pages is irrelevant performance wise.

The pool of free pages was introduced long ago, and it's possible that
recent improvements to the balloon driver had made such pool useless,
at which point it could be removed instead of worked around.

Do you think you could perform some more tests (as pointed out above
against the block device to skip the fs overhead) and report back the
results?

You should add a description about this parameter to
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-driver-xen-blkback

Thanks, Roger.
