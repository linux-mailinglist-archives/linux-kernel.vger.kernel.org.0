Well, one will have to create "fake" partitions in order to concatenate
them with this solution, instead of just concatenating the devices (in
the case where you want to concatenate the entire devices). But the real
debate is below, on the representation.

I don't get why it would not work? Current hardware will just not have
the concatenation support, that's all. How is this a problem?

Yes, the flash-array proposal supports having more than two
partitions/devices concatenated, it is also already supported by the
driver (you don't care about this, but I do :) ).

I see one big issue with this solution: what about bootloaders?

The root cause for such idea is that, in my case, the 2 MTD devices are
too small to contain the images needed to boot. The perfect solution is
to merge the two devices virtually in one single device and let U-Boot
read it like one.

I need to have the same representation both in U-Boot and Linux, hence
a userspace tool and a kernel command line argument do not work, right?

From a coding perspective this is very difficult as bound checks are
done everywhere and lying about the boundaries is IMHO a bit complex.
