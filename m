Hi,

This is a 0.11 release of the Userspace RCU project.

liburcu is a LGPLv2.1 userspace RCU (read-copy-update) library. This
data synchronization library provides read-side access which scales
linearly with the number of cores. It does so by allowing multiple
copies of a given data structure to live at the same time, and by
monitoring the data structure accesses to detect grace periods after
which memory reclamation is possible.

liburcu-cds provides efficient data structures based on RCU and
lock-free algorithms. Those structures include hash tables, queues,
stacks, and doubly-linked lists.

Here is the high-level view of the changes introduced in this release:

* Allow combining many urcu flavors within the same
  compile unit. Prefix public APIs with urcu_<flavor>_ prefix. Keep old
  symbols as aliases for backward compatibility.

* liburcu flavors public headers are moved, including them from previous
  headers for backward compatibility:

  urcu-bp.h -> urcu/urcu-bp.h
  urcu-qsbr.h -> urcu/urcu-qsbr.h
  urcu.h -> urcu/urcu-memb.h
  urcu.h (after #define RCU_MEMBARRIER) -> urcu/urcu-memb.h
  urcu.h (after #define RCU_MB) -> urcu/urcu-mb.h
  urcu.h (after #define RCU_SIGNAL) -> urcu/urcu-mb.h

* The library liburcu is renamed to liburcu-memb, keeping the old
  library name as alias for backward compatibility.

* RCU lock-free hash table debugging:

  --enable-cds-lfht-iter-debug is introduced.

  Building liburcu with --enable-cds-lfht-iter-debug and rebuilding
  application to match the ABI change allows finding cases where the hash
  table iterator is re-purposed to be used on a different hash table
  while still being used to iterate on a hash table.

  This option alters the rculfhash ABI. Make sure to compile both library
  and application with matching configuration.

* Added support for RISC-V architecture.

* Use membarrier PRIVATE_EXPEDITED when available from liburcu-bp and
  liburcu-memb flavors.

The backward compatibility header files, library shared objects, and
symbols will be kept for a few liburcu versions before being removed, at
which point a major soname bump will happen.

As always, feedback is welcome!

Thanks,

Mathieu
