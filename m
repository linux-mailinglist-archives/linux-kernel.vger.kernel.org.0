I had this one last brilliant idea. One last tweak on the concept, as we 
know symbols become influental in computer system design.

I/T L X, which also would support Science tangenting Islam. No more 
hadith/hijabi sects claiming "Islam", it can be refuted by scientific 
understanding of the universe.

Nonsense interpretation and claims of sweaty hijab by force, we support 
thyrian lobotomy for.

Really renovating our own religious view, that once was similar 
monotheism aswell.

And supporting One Dwea without company, the fundamental monotheistic 
principles, very understandable in the indian situation.

I think then I have mananged to shift some money from pop-culture to 
science aswell!

So truly, support I/T L X, it is what the time is screaming for.

Serene Greetings,
Ywe CÃ¦rlyn
I/T L X
