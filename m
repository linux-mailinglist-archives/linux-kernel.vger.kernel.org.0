That a successful queue reset disables interrupts on the queue is beyond
any doubt. My concern is about the fact that a part of the reset itself
is done asynchronously with respect to the PQAP ZAPQ that asks for the
reset.

We need to clean up the NIB. We must avoid use after free like stuff, so
my concern is about the waits.

Yes I'm concerned about do we wait long enough because we need to avoid
HW poking memory that could be used for something else at that point
(NIB, GISA.IPM).

If there is no IRQs AP HW won't just poke guest memory like it does with
the NIB. And since the AP instructions are bound to get reset in progress
response code even there is no danger of queue state leaking because the
reset is not fully completed yet.

My bad, it was supposed to be 0.1 sec == 5 X 20ms (wait after AQIC that
got kicked by this patch). What I want to say is this patch
substantially reduces the wait time.

Yes, my concern is making sure we don't clean up/give up stuff
prematurely. The current code seems to do the waits for this purpose.
I'm not sure what is actually necessary. Clarifying stuff with firmware
or somebody else that knows better than I do is probably a good idea.

I don't think it is an error.

Yes, I also think that is the only way this make sense. But I usually
don't assume complex things happen atomically unless I have a guarantee
they do. I will explain what I mean by this offline.

We are safe after we see the E bit set to one (queue empty) after the
reset. Above I describe the scenarios where we don't wait for that to
happen (in scenario 3 because it won't happen because the card is gone,
and in the other two because of the implemented timeouts).

GISA is a 1 per guest entity in the hypervisor. The NIB is a byte of the
guest memory.

I would not assume that.

You have to also consider stuff like subsystem resets. Yes the last line
of defense should be release(). This is what we do today AFAIU.
