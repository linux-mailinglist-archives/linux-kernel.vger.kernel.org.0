This reads as-if you're saying the firmware isn't spec compliant, and
this is a workaround in order to get the expected behaviour.

Can you please elaborate on what you mean by "relax the requirements"
here? What's your firmware doing or not doing that you want to avoid?

I assume you mean SYSTEM_REET2's SYSTEM_WARM_RESET reset? Please call
that out explicitly by name -- it makes this easier to look up, and
if/when more architectural resets are added the commit message won't
become ambiguous.

A "soft" reboot isn't a PSCI concept, so I'm worried this is just
hooking up magic values for Linux internals.

I'd like to better understand what you're trying to achieve here.

Thanks,
Mark.
