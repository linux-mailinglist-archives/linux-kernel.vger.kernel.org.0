Fully agreed, I think it's now much easier to understand the two balancers
when put side by side in addition to getting some performance gains.
Even if a regression is found, I think it'll be due to a workload seeing
an advantage when NUMA balancer constantly overrides the load balancer.
If that happens, the imbalance can be governed by adjust_numa_balance so
that the two balancers avoid fighting each other again.
