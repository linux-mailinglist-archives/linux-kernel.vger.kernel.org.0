I missed that the number was stored in the array as well. I somehow
expected that it was array of strings.

I personally do not like switch/case. It is a lot of code.
I wonder if it even saved some space.

If you want to safe space, I would use u16 to store the numbers.
Or I would use array of strings. There will be only few holes.

You might also consider handling only the most commonly
used codes from errno.h and errno-base.h (1..133). There will
be no holes and the codes are stable.

I am not completely sure that %p modifiers were a good idea.
They came before I started maintaining printk(). They add more
complex algorithms into paths where we could not report problems
easily (printk recursion). Also they are causing problems with
unit testing that might be done in userspace. These non-standard
formats cause that printk() can't be simply substituted by printf().

I am not keen to spread these problems over more formats.
Also %d format is more complicated. It is often used with
already existing modifiers.

OK, upper letters probably are not a problem.

But what about EWOULDBLOCK and EDEADLOCK? They have the same
error codes as EAGAIN and EDEADLK. It might cause a lot of confusion.
People might spend a lot of time searching for EAGAIN before they
notice that EWOULDBLOCK was used in the code instead.

Also you still did not answer the question where the idea came from.
Did it just look nice? Anyone asked for it? Who? Why?

It looks like a lot of potentially useless work.

Please, do the opposite. Add conversion of few subsystems into the
patchset and add more people into CC. We will see immediately whether
it makes sense to spend time on this.

I personally think that this feature is not worth the code, data,
and bikeshedding.
