I am a little confused, maybe I am wrong.

As Neil say: "If wait_event_interruptible() finds that the condition is 
true, it will report success whether there was a signal or not.", this 
wait_event_interruptible may return 0 for this scenes? so we will go 
loop and call flock_lock_inode again, and after we exits the loop with 
error equals 0(if we try lock), the lock has call locks_move_blocks and 
leave fl_blocked_requests as NULL?
