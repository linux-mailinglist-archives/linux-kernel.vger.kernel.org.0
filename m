Yes, that’ what I was told by the NVMe vendor, so all I know is to impose a  
memory barrier.
If mb() shouldn’t be used here, what’s the correct variant to use in this  
context?

I tested the patch from Keith and it has two issues just as simply skipping  
nvme_dev_disable():
1) It consumes more power in S2I
2) System freeze after resume

Also I don’t think it’s a spec. It’s a guide to let OEM/ODM pick and  
assemble Modern Standby compliant machines, so what Windows NVMe driver  
really does is still opaque to us.
