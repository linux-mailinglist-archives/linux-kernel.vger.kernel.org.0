I got this, and this is a good thing!

Well, it does not block but passing -EAGAIN directly back is not nice.
Or does the hw_random framework handle this?

Maybe our -EAGAIN handling is buggy.
That said I'm all for changing the driver to use the right framework
but please make sure that we don't drop useful stuff like -EAGAIN handling.
