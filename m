-* Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller
-
-The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
-a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
-differences between the core mmc properties described by mmc.txt and the
-properties used by the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.
-
-Required Properties:
-
-* compatible: should be
-	- snps,dw-mshc: for controllers compliant with synopsys dw-mshc.
-* #address-cells: should be 1.
-* #size-cells: should be 0.
-
-# Slots (DEPRECATED): The slot specific information are contained within
-  child-nodes with each child-node representing a supported slot. There should
-  be atleast one child node representing a card slot. The name of the child node
-  representing the slot is recommended to be slot@n where n is the unique number
-  of the slot connected to the controller. The following are optional properties
-  which can be included in the slot child node.
-
-	* reg: specifies the physical slot number. The valid values of this
-	  property is 0 to (num-slots -1), where num-slots is the value
-	  specified by the num-slots property.
-
-	* bus-width: as documented in mmc core bindings.
-
-	* wp-gpios: specifies the write protect gpio line. The format of the
-	  gpio specifier depends on the gpio controller. If a GPIO is not used
-	  for write-protect, this property is optional.
-
-	* disable-wp: If the wp-gpios property isn't present then (by default)
-	  we'd assume that the write protect is hooked up directly to the
-	  controller's special purpose write protect line (accessible via
-	  the WRTPRT register).  However, it's possible that we simply don't
-	  want write protect.  In that case specify 'disable-wp'.
-	  NOTE: This property is not required for slots known to always
-	  connect to eMMC or SDIO cards.
-
-Optional properties:
-
-* resets: phandle + reset specifier pair, intended to represent hardware
-  reset signal present internally in some host controller IC designs.
-  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt for details.
-
-* reset-names: request name for using "resets" property. Must be "reset".
-	(It will be used together with "resets" property.)
-
-* clocks: from common clock binding: handle to biu and ciu clocks for the
-  bus interface unit clock and the card interface unit clock.
-
-* clock-names: from common clock binding: Shall be "biu" and "ciu".
-  If the biu clock is missing we'll simply skip enabling it.  If the
-  ciu clock is missing we'll just assume that the clock is running at
-  clock-frequency.  It is an error to omit both the ciu clock and the
-  clock-frequency.
-
-* clock-frequency: should be the frequency (in Hz) of the ciu clock.  If this
-  is specified and the ciu clock is specified then we'll try to set the ciu
-  clock to this at probe time.
-
-* fifo-depth: The maximum size of the tx/rx fifo's. If this property is not
-  specified, the default value of the fifo size is determined from the
-  controller registers.
-
-* card-detect-delay: Delay in milli-seconds before detecting card after card
-  insert event. The default value is 0.
-
-* data-addr: Override fifo address with value provided by DT. The default FIFO reg
-  offset is assumed as 0x100 (version < 0x240A) and 0x200(version >= 0x240A) by
-  driver. If the controller does not follow this rule, please use this property
-  to set fifo address in device tree.
-
-* fifo-watermark-aligned: Data done irq is expected if data length is less than
-  watermark in PIO mode. But fifo watermark is requested to be aligned with data
-  length in some SoC so that TX/RX irq can be generated with data done irq. Add this
-  watermark quirk to mark this requirement and force fifo watermark setting
-  accordingly.
-
-* vmmc-supply: The phandle to the regulator to use for vmmc.  If this is
-  specified we'll defer probe until we can find this regulator.
-
-* dmas: List of DMA specifiers with the controller specific format as described
-  in the generic DMA client binding. Refer to dma.txt for details.
-
-* dma-names: request names for generic DMA client binding. Must be "rx-tx".
-  Refer to dma.txt for details.
-
-Aliases:
-
-- All the MSHC controller nodes should be represented in the aliases node using
-  the following format 'mshc{n}' where n is a unique number for the alias.
-
-Example:
-
-The MSHC controller node can be split into two portions, SoC specific and
-board specific portions as listed below.
