Yeah, I suggested adding require_osd_release to the client portion just
because we are running into it more and more: Objecter relies on it for
RESEND_ON_SPLIT for example.  It needs to be accessible so that patches
like that can be carried over to the kernel client without workarounds.

copy-from in its existing form is another example.  AFAIU the problem
is that copy-from op doesn't reject unknown flags.  Luis added a flag
in https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/25374, but it is simply ignored on
nautilus and older releases, potentially leading to data corruption.

Adding a new op that would be an alias for CEPH_OSD_OP_COPY_FROM with
CEPH_OSD_COPY_FROM_FLAG_TRUNCATE_SEQ like Jeff is suggesting, or a new
copy-from2 op that would behave just like copy-from, but reject unknown
flags to avoid similar compatibility issues in the future is probably
the best thing we can do from the client perspective.

Thanks,

                Ilya
