I'd prefer avoiding another glue :-)

Maybe we don't need to care, actually. Since this property will only be
needed for RTL instantiation that didn't configure these defaults
properly during coreConsultant.

Thank you, now I'm certain that this is not some temporary solution :-)

Thanks for going through this again. Please refresh the patch so we can
try to get it merged.
