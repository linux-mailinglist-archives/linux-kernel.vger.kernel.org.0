Don't worry, I was not suggesting to change the framework. I was
questionning our driver implementation.

If I understand, the framework will call pre/post_req only if it has
more than one request ?

Our driver only enable "chained mode" (and the related dma mapping) in
these callback. I don't think it worth enabling "chained mode" if there
is only one request (nothing to chain)

According to you:

* Is it a good idea to enable chained mode only when framework calls
  pre/post req ? (AFAICT, this is what the dw_mmc.c driver is doing)

There is a pretty interresting comment in jz4740_mmc.c about that:

/*
 * The MMC core allows to prepare a mmc_request while another mmc_request
 * is in-flight. This is used via the pre_req/post_req hooks.
 * This driver uses the pre_req/post_req hooks to map/unmap the mmc_request.
 * Following what other drivers do (sdhci, dw_mmc) we use the following cookie
 * flags to keep track of the mmc_request mapping state.
 *
 * COOKIE_UNMAPPED: the request is not mapped.
 * COOKIE_PREMAPPED: the request was mapped in pre_req,
 * and should be unmapped in post_req.
 * COOKIE_MAPPED: the request was mapped in the irq handler,
 * and should be unmapped before mmc_request_done is called..
 */

 Should we try to follow that ?

* OR, we should keep enabling it whenever we can ? In this case, it is
  probably better to not provide pre/post_req to the framework and
  manage things directly in the .request() callback ?

At the moment, we are doing both so it is difficult to figure out what
is doing what ...
