Any maintainer who reads this might interpret this as an encouragement
to establish custom policies. I think one of the conclusions of the
Linux Plumbers 2019 edition is that too much diversity is bad and that
we need more uniformity across kernel subsystems with regard what is
expected from patch contributors. I would appreciate if a summary of
https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/4/contributions/554/attachments/353/584/Reflections__Kernel_Summit_2019.pdf
would be integrated in the maintainer handbook.

Thanks,

Bart.
