=E2=80=A6 but this is proving difficult because even if we fixed that =
directly, lockdep
Is still able to find an indirect dependency chain, for example [1]

CPU1: console_owner =E2=80=94> port_lock_key
CPU2: port_lock_key =E2=80=94> (&port->lock)->rlock
CPU3: (&port->lock)->rlock =E2=80=94> zone->lock

which will trigger a splat with

zone->lock =E2=80=94> console_owner

dump_page() in set_migratetype_isolate() needs that =E2=80=9Cpage=E2=80=9D=

Sounds like a good idea. I=E2=80=99ll send a v2.
