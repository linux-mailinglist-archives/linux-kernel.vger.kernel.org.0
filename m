This is totally crazy: Even when I omit the -w option to openvt, so that 
I can log out from tty1, then switch to the new VT and enter 
'dbus-run-session startplasmacompositor' there, the KDE session starts 
on tty1, though of course logging out from /dev/tty1 changed its owner 
to root. So, how can a process with real UID, effective UID and saved 
UID (I checked that) change the ownership of a device that was owned by 
root?

Still nobody who has an idea what is going on here with the virtual 
terminals?

Regards
   Christoph
