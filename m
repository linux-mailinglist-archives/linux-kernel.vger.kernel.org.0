Added some instrumentation to record values and ran test,

557904 Total

549186 COMPACT_DEFERRED
  8718 COMPACT_PARTIAL_SKIPPED

Do note that this is not my biggest problem with these allocations.  That is
should_continue_reclaim returning true more often that in should.  Still
trying to get more info on that.  This was just something curious I also
discovered.
