Hi Russell, thanks for the review.

Sorry but I don't see any incorrect DT here. From the ARM CPU bindings I ga=
ther
that (at least since ARMv7) every CPU node should contain its corresponding
MPIDR. It transpires that ARM's DT cpu map init code should take that into
account regardles of whether the kernel supports SMP, isn't it?

Regards,
Nicolas
