I agree.  This leaves it open that this handles any special processing which is
required.

FWIW the same call is made in put_page() and has no comment so perhaps we are
getting wrapped around the axle for no reason?

Frankly I questioned myself when I mentioned put_page_testzero() as well.  But
I'm ok with Johns suggestion.  My wording was a bit "rushed".  Sorry about
that.  I wanted to remove the word 'fail' from the comment because I think it
is what caught Michal's eye.
