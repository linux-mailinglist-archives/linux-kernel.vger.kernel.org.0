Subject: [RFC] kasan: include the hashed pointer for an object's location

The vast majority of the kernel that needs to print out pointers as a
way to keep track of a specific object in the kernel for debugging
purposes does so using hashed pointers, since these are "good enough".
Ironically, the one place we don't do this is within kasan. While
simply printing a hashed version of where an out of bounds memory access
occurred isn't too useful, printing out the hashed address of the object
in question usually is since that's the format most of the kernel is
likely to be using in debugging output.

Of course this isn't perfect though-having the object's originating
address doesn't help users at all that need to do things like printing
the address of a struct which is embedded within another struct, but
it's certainly better then not printing any hashed addresses. And users
which need to handle less trivial cases like that can simply fall back
to careful usage of %px.
