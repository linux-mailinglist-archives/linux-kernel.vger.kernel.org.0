Got it. I misunderstood it that two bank switches are performed as part of
disable_stream.

This is clear. Even though the channels remains enabled, i believe there
won't be any data pushed on lines as stream will be closed.

Regarding mirroring approach, I assume after bank switch we will take
snapshot of active bank and program same in inactive bank.
