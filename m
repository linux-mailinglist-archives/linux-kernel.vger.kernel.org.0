Considering the alternative proposed by PeterZ, which is to iterate over
all processes/threads from an unprivileged process, I would be tempted
to put some more thoughts into the mm->membarrier_state cache-line. Do
we expect it to be typically hot ? Is there anything we can do to move
this field into a typically hot mm cacheline ?

I agree with your approach aiming to typically just load that field
(no store in the common case).

One issue here is that membarrier iterates over all runqueues without
grabbing any runqueue lock. If we copy that state from mm to rq on
sched switch prepare, we would need to ensure we have the proper
memory barriers between:

prior user-space memory accesses  /  setting the runqueue membarrier state

and

setting the runqueue membarrier state / following user-space memory accesses

Copying the membarrier state into the task struct leverages the fact that
we have documented and guaranteed those barriers around the rq->curr update
in the scheduler.

Thanks,

Mathieu
