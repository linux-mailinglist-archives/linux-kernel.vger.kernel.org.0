This looks to me that this would cause more issues in other parts of
the code if a compiler ever decided to do this.

But I still don't care for this case. It's a cache, nothing more. No
guarantee that anything will be recorded.

Let me put it this way. My biggest issue with this, is that the
READ/WRITE_ONCE() has *nothing* to do with the bug you are trying to
fix.

That bug is that we did the decision of starting the probes outside the
mutex. That is fixed my moving the decision into the mutex. The
READ/WRITE_ONCE() is just added noise.
