Hi Paul,

Thanks for pulling this together! Some comments below (based only on the

I suspect that on nohz_full cpus, at least some use-cases which really care
about not receiving IPIs will not be doing that many context switches.

What are the possible approaches to have IPI-*elimination* for nohz cpus ?

I have a hard time buying the "less complexity" argument to justify the
introduction of yet another flavor of RCU when a close match already
exists (SRCU).

The other argument for this task-based RCU (rather than CPU-by-CPU as
done by SRCU) is that "a task-by-task approach is needed". What I
do not get from this explanation is why is such an approach needed ?

Also, another aspect worth discussing here is the use-cases which
need to be covered by tracing-rcu. Is this specific flavor targeting
specifically preempt-off use-cases, or is the goal here to target
use-cases which may trigger major page faults within the read-side
critical section as well ?

Note that doing task-by-task tracking of tracing-rcu rather than
cpu-by-cpu is not free: AFAIU it bloats the task struct (always)
for a use-case which is not always active. My experience with
tracepoints and asm gotos is that we need to be careful not to
slow down the common case (kernel running without any tracing
active, but tracing configured in) if we want to keep distributions
and end users building kernels with introspection facilities in
place.

Thanks,

Mathieu
