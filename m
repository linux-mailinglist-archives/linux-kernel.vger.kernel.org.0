The easier way I found to encapsulate the three compilers is using
CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO, hence I would prefer to not drop it.

In the case of gcc:
-------------------

CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT ?= $(CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO:"%"=%)

$(CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT)gcc ...

In the case of clang:
---------------------

CLANG_TRIPLE ?= $(CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO:"%-"=%)

clang --target=$(notdir $CLANG_TRIPLE)

This will prevent the vdso32 library generation to depend from a fixed
configuration that might change in future.

Based on this work we will be able to add COMPAT_CC_IS_CLANG, COMPAT_CC_IS_GCC
and COMPAT_CC_GCC_VERSION, COMPAT_CC_CLANG_VERSION which will help us in a more
fine grain control of the compiler versions.

The clang support will be added shortly after the header problems have been
addressed, because without that and the possibility to have 32bit headers in
arm64 would result in a broken target.

Thank you for the explanation, if I understand it correctly the strategy
proposed above should cover all the cased proposed. Please, let me know if i
need to tweak something.

The plan is to use binutils to build the vdso libraries with both the compilers.
