My point was, *this* patch is just using it.  The implementation has
already been applied to the mainline kernel.  Who wrote the initial
commit is not important at this point.

It looks like the HID Usage implementation is using a set of
pre-defined values to identify sensor *types*:

  include/linux/hid-sensor-ids.h

Where as your implementation is confusing me.  In some instances you
are using it as what looks like an *index* into a register set:

  ec_cmd_read_u16(st->ec,
                EC_MEMMAP_ACC_DATA +
                sizeof(s16) *
                (1 + i + st->sensor_num * MAX_AXIS),
                data);

And at other times it is used for sensor *types*, but in a very
limited way:

  enum motionsensor_location {
          MOTIONSENSE_LOC_BASE = 0,
          MOTIONSENSE_LOC_LID = 1,
          MOTIONSENSE_LOC_MAX,
  };

  static char *cros_ec_accel_legacy_loc_strings[] = {
          [MOTIONSENSE_LOC_BASE] = "base",
          [MOTIONSENSE_LOC_LID] = "lid",
          [MOTIONSENSE_LOC_MAX] = "unknown",
  };

  return sprintf(buf, "%s\n",
                 cros_ec_accel_legacy_loc_strings[st->sensor_num +
                                                MOTIONSENSE_LOC_BASE]);

What what is 'sensor_num'; is it a channel address/number similar to
what I2C HIDs use to communicate over a specific I2C line, or is it a
type, similar to what HID devices provide on request for
identification purposes?

Is this a separate question, or can 'sensor_num' be any unique
arbitrary number?
