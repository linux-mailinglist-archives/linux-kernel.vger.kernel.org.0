x86_init_cache_qos() fnds the minimum number of rmid on all CPUs and
store it in boot_cpu_data.

If removing the two variables from cpuinfo_x86 and getting number of
rmid and occupancy scale in rdt_get_mon_l3_config() directly from
CPUID on the current CPU, we need to assume all CPUs have the same
number of rmid.

Is this a right assumption?

After think again, it might be a right assumption after all. AFAICT, each
Intel platform that supports resctrl has the same number of rmid on all
CPUs and there is no plan to have a resctrl platform that has different
numbers of rmid on CPUs.

So Ok, I will write the patch #1 that removes the two variables from
cpuinfo_x86 and gets the info directly from CPUID in rdt_get_mon_l3_config().

Thanks.
