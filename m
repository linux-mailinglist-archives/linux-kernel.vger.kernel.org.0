Yes, there is a way. Not really fast, but use
for_each_node_with_property(node, "phys") and filter on ones matching
your phy's node.

Not really a concern from a binding standpoint. Bindings shouldn't be
designed around some OS's current design or limitations.

There's already several cases using PHY_TYPE_* in phy cells, so I'm
not sure what the issue is.

Good point. That could work as well.
