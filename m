I think we can consider these allocations being DMA-like (because
Hypervisor accesses this memory too) so you can probably take a look at
dma_pool_create()/dma_pool_alloc() and friends.

Let's spell it out (as BUILD_BUG_ON(HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE < PAGE_SIZE) or
something like that) then to make it clear.
