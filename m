Or to spell it out more clearly: Braindead hardware. Really.

Nah, that's terrible. The right thing to do is indeed to mop up the mess
that the bootloader is bound to leave and start with a clean slate.

readl_relaxed(), please. irq is not quite the right type either, please 
use a u32.

Don't you need to do something about the FIQ side as well?

         M.
