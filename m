Thanks, that's an excellent series!

I've queued it up in sched/core with a handful of readability edits to 
comments and changelogs.

There are some upstreaming caveats though, I expect this series to be a 
performance regression magnet:

 - load_balance() and wake-up changes invariably are such: some workloads 
   only work/scale well by accident, and if we touch the logic it might 
   flip over into a less advantageous scheduling pattern.

 - In particular the changes from balancing and waking on runnable load 
   to full load that includes blocking *will* shift IO-intensive 
   workloads that you tests don't fully capture I believe. You also made 
   idle balancing more aggressive in essence - which might reduce cache 
   locality for some workloads.

A full run on Mel Gorman's magic scalability test-suite would be super 
useful ...

Anyway, please be on the lookout for such performance regression reports.

Also, we seem to have grown a fair amount of these TODO entries:

  kernel/sched/fair.c: * XXX borrowed from update_sg_lb_stats
  kernel/sched/fair.c: * XXX: only do this for the part of runnable > running ?
  kernel/sched/fair.c:     * XXX illustrate
  kernel/sched/fair.c:    } else if (sd_flag & SD_BALANCE_WAKE) { /* XXX always ? */
  kernel/sched/fair.c: * can also include other factors [XXX].
  kernel/sched/fair.c: * [XXX expand on:
  kernel/sched/fair.c: * [XXX more?]
  kernel/sched/fair.c: * [XXX write more on how we solve this.. _after_ merging pjt's patches that
  kernel/sched/fair.c:             * XXX for now avg_load is not computed and always 0 so we
  kernel/sched/fair.c:            /* XXX broken for overlapping NUMA groups */

:-)

Thanks,

	Ingo
