DRM is 2-level for pretty much everything. First it lands in a driver
tree (or a collectiv of drivers, like in drm-misc). Then those send
pull requests to drm.git for integration. Busy trees do that every 1-2
weeks (e.g. amdgpu), slower trees once per merge window (e.g. nouveau)
for drm-next, similar for drm-fixes.
