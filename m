Good point. That's actually why I included the change in patch7 ("mmc:
core: WARN if SDIO IRQs are enabled for non-powered card in suspend")

In principle it means that host->sdio_irqs must not be greater than 0,
if the card isn't powered.

Hmm, perhaps we should convert the WARN to return an error code
instead, just to be really safe. What do you think?

Thanks, I add your tested by tag as well!
