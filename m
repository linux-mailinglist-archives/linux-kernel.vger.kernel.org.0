And for the time being, can just print a warning when crashkernel= param
is used, in mem_encrypt_init() code. alert people to increase the memory
size swiotlb_size_or_default().

In the future, if the crashkernel=auto is doable then kernel can adapt
to that in code.  Even if it is reasonable to let admin to provide a
exact value but sometimes it is hard to know these kernel requirement
details..
