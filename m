Yes, DTspec doesn't explicitly say so, but it does follow fairly 
logically from the definition of "ranges"/"dma-ranges" as a translation 
between address spaces that an address not matching any range cannot 
pass between those address spaces at all. Case in point being that an 
absent "ranges" property means "no translation at all" (sadly the ship 
sailed too long ago to treat "dma-ranges" similarly strictly, so we're 
stuck with the assumption that absent = empty in that direction)

Careful there - DMA *masks* are about how wide an address the device may 
generate, but it's not necessarily true that the interconnect beyond 
will actually accept every possible address that that many bits can 
encode (see the aforementioned case of PCI host bridge windows, or the 
recent change of bus_dma_mask to a not-necessarily-power-of-two 
bus_dma_limit)...

...thus that assumption is incorrect. However it's not particularly 
important to the immediate problem at hand.

That much is agreed. For a physical address A in Y, phys_to_dma(A) 
should return the corresponding DMA address A' in X. What you're 
proposing is that for address B not in Y, phys_to_dma(B) should just 
return B, but my point is that even doing that is wrong, because there 
is no possible DMA address corresponding to B, so there is no valid 
value to return at all.

Nobody's disputing that the current dma_direct_supported() 
implementation is broken for the case where ZONE_DMA itself is offset 
from PA 0; the more pressing question is why Christoph's diff, which was 
trying to take that into account, still didn't work.
