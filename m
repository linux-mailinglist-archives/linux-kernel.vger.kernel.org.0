Hi Mark,

I understand, this is why I first went another route of solving this
problem: pre-reserving contiguous memory, and avoid relocation
entirely (the same as what happens during crash reboot). But, that
solution was not accepted because it introduces a change to the common
code to solve ARM specific problem. So, James Morse, and other
suggested that I take a look at the root of the problem, and enable
MMU during relocation by doing what is already done during hibernate
restore.

Yes, we have an extremely tight reboot budget, 0.35s is not an acceptable waste.
