Hi Steven,

I just started a week ago implementing ptdump for PA-RISC. Didn't notice that
you're working on making it generic, which is nice. I'll adjust my code
to use the infrastructure you're currently developing.

My understanding is that PA-RISC only has leaf entries on PTE level.

I'll take care of the PA-RISC part - for 32 bit your generic code works, for 64Bit
i need to learn a bit more about the following hack:

arch/parisc/include/asm/pgalloc.h:15
/* Allocate the top level pgd (page directory)
 *
 * Here (for 64 bit kernels) we implement a Hybrid L2/L3 scheme: we
 * allocate the first pmd adjacent to the pgd.  This means that we can
 * subtract a constant offset to get to it.  The pmd and pgd sizes are
 * arranged so that a single pmd covers 4GB (giving a full 64-bit
 * process access to 8TB) so our lookups are effectively L2 for the
 * first 4GB of the kernel (i.e. for all ILP32 processes and all the
 * kernel for machines with under 4GB of memory)
 */

I see that your change clear P?D entries when p?d_bad() returns true, which - i think -
would be the case with the PA-RISC implementation.

Regards
Sven
