Yes.

I believe that is the case here but looking at the GCC source gives me a
headache.

The GCC documentation also has this description for '-mabi=elfv1' and
'-mabi=elfv2':

-mabi=elfv1:
Change the current ABI to use the ELFv1 ABI. This is the default ABI for
big-endian PowerPC 64-bit Linux. Overriding the default ABI requires
special system support and is likely to fail in spectacular ways.

-mabi=elfv2:
Change the current ABI to use the ELFv2 ABI. This is the default ABI for
little-endian PowerPC 64-bit Linux. Overriding the default ABI requires
special system support and is likely to fail in spectacular ways.

https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-Options.html#index-mabi_003delfv1

Thinking about this a little bit more, I think this patch is correct in
the case that clang is cross compiling because the target triple will
always be specified (so the default ABI doesn't need to be changed).
However, I am not sure how native compiling would be affected by this
change; in theory, if someone was on a little endian system and wanted
to build a big endian kernel, they would probably need -mabi=elfv1
like GCC would but I don't have any real way to test this nor am I sure
that anyone actually natively compiles PowerPC kernels with clang. It's
probably not worrying about at this point so I'll just move forward with
a v2 rewording the commit message.

Cheers,
Nathan
