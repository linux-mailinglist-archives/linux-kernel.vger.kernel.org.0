Now the attribute would be supplying two types of information:

        1) Does the driver know the orientation
        2) The current orientation

Let's not do that! If you really need this, then just implement the
".is_visible" callback with it. You just need to add a flag to the
struct typec_capability that tells does the driver know the
orientation or not. Something like:

        unsigned int orientation_aware:1;

We already "hide" the identity information if the underlying driver
is unable to supply it. By making this attribute optional as well (by
hiding it when it's not known), the style of exposing the information
is kept the same throughout the class.

thanks,
