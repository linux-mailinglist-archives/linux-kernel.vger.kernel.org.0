Now I tried it again with 4.19 kernel + patch (because sata_nv is broken)
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ide/20191213080408.27032-1-s.hauer@pengutroni=
x.de/T/#u
and there is no error in dmesg when calling hdparm -B254 on disk without
APM support when sata_nv is in ADMA mode.

So I think this problem with error messages in dmesg is finally solved.
But I do not know which change in kernel fixed it (or only hide?).

Just for completeness here is output from hdparm (sda does not support
APM, sdb supports APM):

$ sudo hdparm -B254 /dev/sda

/dev/sda:
 setting Advanced Power Management level to 0xfe (254)
SG_IO: bad/missing sense data, sb[]:  70 00 05 00 00 00 00 0a 04 51 40 fe 2=
1 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
 APM_level      =3D not supported

$ sudo hdparm -B254 /dev/sdb

/dev/sdb:
 setting Advanced Power Management level to 0xfe (254)
 APM_level      =3D off

By the way, do you know what that SG_IO error reported by hdparm means?
