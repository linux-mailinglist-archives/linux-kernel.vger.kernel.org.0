I'm a complete CFS bandwidth noob but let me give this a try...


-Wconversion does pick this up (turning this thing on made me understand
why it's not on by default)

kernel/sched/fair.c: In function ‘distribute_cfs_runtime’:
kernel/sched/fair.c:4633:13: warning: conversion to ‘u64’ {aka ‘long long unsigned int’} from ‘s64’ {aka ‘long long int’} may change the sign of the result [-Wsign-conversion]
   runtime = -cfs_rq->runtime_remaining + 1;
             ^
kernel/sched/fair.c:4638:29: warning: conversion to ‘long long unsigned int’ from ‘s64’ {aka ‘long long int’} may change the sign of the result [-Wsign-conversion]
   cfs_rq->runtime_remaining += runtime;
                             ^~


The thing is we have a !cfs_rq_throttled() check just before the snippet
you're calling out, so AFAICT cfs_rq->runtime_remaining has to be <= 0
there (otherwise this cfs_rq wouldn't be throttled).

I doubt you can get this to fire, but just to be sure...

Other than those signed/unsigned shenanigans, I only see one other scenario
that leads to a cfs_rq getting allocated all the remaining runtime: its
.runtime_remaining just has to be greater or equal (in absolute value)
than the remaining runtime.

If that's happening consistently, I suppose that could be due to long
delays between update_curr_fair() calls, but I can't think right why that
would happen.
