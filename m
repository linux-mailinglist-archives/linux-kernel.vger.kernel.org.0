Humm, confused...In the existing code bus and master are synonyms, see 
e.g. following code excerpts:

  * sdw_add_bus_master() - add a bus Master instance
  * @bus: bus instance
  *
  * Initializes the bus instance, read properties and create child
  * devices.

struct sdw_bus {
	struct device *dev; <<< pointer here
	unsigned int link_id;
	struct list_head slaves;
	DECLARE_BITMAP(assigned, SDW_MAX_DEVICES);
	struct mutex bus_lock;
	struct mutex msg_lock;
	const struct sdw_master_ops *ops;
	const struct sdw_master_port_ops *port_ops;
	struct sdw_bus_params params;
	struct sdw_master_prop prop;

The existing code creates a platform_device in 
drivers/soundwire/intel_init.c, and it's assigned by the following code:

static int intel_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	struct sdw_cdns_stream_config config;
	struct sdw_intel *sdw;
	int ret;

	sdw = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(*sdw), GFP_KERNEL);
[snip]
	sdw->cdns.dev = &pdev->dev;
	sdw->cdns.bus.dev = &pdev->dev;

I really don't see what you are hinting at, sorry, unless we are talking 
about major surgery in the code.
