It is a useless comment actually. I will remove it.
There is a gate clock between the xtal clock and PLL clocks(and other 
clocks)

Yes, same with the PLL driver. Romcode is boot ROM.

Here is a reference to g12a-aoclkc.c
The g12a_aoclk_32k_by_oscin_sel has the same flag.
I am confused about the flag here.

The ceca and cecb clocks' parent is rtc_clk. It
can be set to 32k, and it has been verified by
clock measurement.

Yes, it is index 2, it is the third parent in datasheet. I will change it

Yes, it is index 4 .

For A1 ad401 board, the cpu voltage is controlled by PMU regulator. And 
for A1 ad409 board, the cpu voltage is controlled by PWM regulator, The 
PWM A channel feeds the cpu voltage, it is initialized in BL2. So it is 
necessary to add critical flag.

In G12A board, (arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic/meson-g12a-sei510.dts +194)
the regulator is PWM regulator too.

Compared with G12A, the PWM clock is in A1 periphs clock controller.
However, the PWM clock is in PWM controller in G12A.
We enable the clock by setting pwm register directly , it has not been 
registered to the CCF.

Yes, it is fclk_div2. I will replace it as fdiv2 for short

OK, I will remove meson_eeclkc_data here. And use the variables directly.
