I think there is a little misunderstanding here. By being close to the
scheduler I was referring to rt, dl, irq which are not driven via an
arch_scale_FOO function.

But I guess we agree that FOO=thermal_pressure should use this
arch_scale_FOO function so we don't have a direct link between scheduler
and thermal subsystem.

We disagree in the point whether the provider should be present and
working when the only consumer is disabled by the kernel config.

I guess we can't discuss the technical angle of this issue any further
so maybe the maintainer of drivers/base/arch_topology.c should make a
decision (the actual code is in 3/8 of this patch-set).
