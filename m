Actually our jenkins server parse the kernel log and look for bad
messages from the driver...
But the main reason for this, IMO, is for developers (in userspace)
that run with a terminal open on the kernel log to see if something
bad happens while they run their applications.

Reset can be triggered by two main reasons, but a userspace
application is *not* one of them.
It can be due to a command submission not finishing in time or from a
major error in the device (e.g. double ECC error).
That's why I think it is important to tell them the reset +
re-initialization flow was finished successfully.
Of course all this information, let's call it operational status, can
be acquired by the INFO IOCTL the driver provides, but it is *really*
convenient, IMHO, to see these type of messages in the kernel log
while they happen.
