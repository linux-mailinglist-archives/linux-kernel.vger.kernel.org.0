Yes and no, it does call things introduced in patch 8, I questioned calling probe!

I am quoting the code in patch, which i pointed in my first reply!

This is intel specific file...

this is intel driver, intel function!

                            ^^^^^^
which does this... calls a probe()!

I rest my case!
