The kernel documentation includes a brief section about genhd
capabilities, but it turns out that the only documented
capability (GENHD_FL_MEDIA_CHANGE_NOTIFY) isn't used any more.

This patch removes that flag, and documents the rest, based on my
understanding of the current uses of these flags in the kernel. The
documentation is kept in the header file, alongside the declarations,
in the hope that it will be kept up-to-date in future; the kernel
documentation is changed to include the documentation generated from
the header file.

Because the ultimate goal is to provide some end-user
documentation (or end-administrator documentation), the comments are
perhaps more user-oriented than might be expected.

+/**
+ * DOC: genhd capability flags
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_REMOVABLE`` (1): indicates that the block device gives
+ * access to removable media.
+ * When set, the device remains present even when media is not
+ * inserted.
+ * Must not be set for devices which are removed entirely when the
+ * media is removed.
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_CD`` (8): the block device is a CD-ROM-style device.
+ * Affects responses to the ``CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY`` ioctl.
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_UP`` (16): indicates that the block device is "up", with
+ * a similar meaning to network interfaces.
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_SUPPRESS_PARTITION_INFO`` (32): don't include partition
+ * information in ``/proc/partitions`` or in the output of
+ * printk_all_partitions().
+ * Used for the null block device and some MMC devices.
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_EXT_DEVT`` (64): the driver supports extended dynamic
+ * ``dev_t``, i.e. it wants extended device numbers
+ * (``BLOCK_EXT_MAJOR``).
+ * This affects the maximum number of partitions.
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_NATIVE_CAPACITY`` (128): based on information in the
+ * partition table, the device's capacity has been extended to its
+ * native capacity; i.e. the device has hidden capacity used by one
+ * of the partitions (this is a flag used so that native capacity is
+ * only ever unlocked once).
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_BLOCK_EVENTS_ON_EXCL_WRITE`` (256): event polling is
+ * blocked whenever a writer holds an exclusive lock.
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN`` (512): partition scanning is disabled.
+ * Used for loop devices in their default settings and some MMC
+ * devices.
+ *
+ * ``GENHD_FL_HIDDEN`` (1024): the block device is hidden; it doesn't
+ * produce events, doesn't appear in sysfs, and doesn't have an
+ * associated ``bdev``.
+ * Implies ``GENHD_FL_SUPPRESS_PARTITION_INFO`` and
+ * ``GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN``.
+ * Used for multipath devices.
