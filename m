Hi Greg

This is in response to my review of the code in staging. The current
code is missing a core feature for an Ethernet switch driver, being
able to send/receive frames from the host. At the moment it can only
control the hardware for how it switches Ethernet frames coming
into/going out of external ports.

One of the core ideas behind how linux handles Ethernet switches is
that they are just a bunch of network interfaces. And currently, these
network interfaces cannot send/receive. We would never move an
Ethernet driver out of staging which cannot send/receive, so i don't
see why we should move an Ethernet switch driver out of staging which
also cannot send/receive.

Maybe this patchset could be minimised. The STP handling is just nice
to have, and could wait until the driver has moved into the main tree.
