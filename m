We use Documentation/gpu already for the developer guide, I think
going with "gpu" on the admin guide for consistency would be good. I
do personally think that splitting out the admin guide makes sense, we
could also put some recommendations about access rights for drm device
nodes and stuff like that in there.

I'm not sure it makes sense to split out the kapi and uapi sides of
the docs complete. For the admin guide I think one overall book
covering all subsystems is good. But someone creating a drm/kms
compositor is not going to be interested much into some special
options for networking protocol I think. For those I think focusing
more on the specific subsystem makes more sense (and easier to share
common concepts/diagrams between uapi and kapi of a given subsystem).

I do think for a given subsystem the uapi side should be clearly split
out (otherwise it's impossible to find for non-kernel people). And
currently drm falls short really badly on this. So maybe a good
argument for a uapi kernel directory would be to force that, but not
sure that's good enough of a reason.
