Sure. Let me try to explain this a little.

    split_huge_page_to_list
        unmap_page
	    try_to_unmap_one
                ...
                __split_huge_pmd_locked
        __split_huge_page
            remap_page

There are two dimensions:

   * PMD mapped THP and PTE mapped THP
   * HWPOISON-ed page and non-HWPOISON-ed page

So there are total 4 cases.

1. First let's take a look at the normal case, when HWPOISON is not set.

If the page is PMD-mapped, SPLIT_FREEZE is passed down in flags. And finally
passed to __split_huge_pmd_locked. In this function, when freeze is true, PTE
will be set to migration entry. And because __split_huge_pmd_locked save
migration entry to PTE, try_to_unmap_one will not do real unmap. Then
remap_page restore those migration entry back. 

If the page is PTE-mapped, __split_huge_pmd_locked will be skipped since this
is already done. This means try_to_unmap_one will do the real unmap. Because
SPLIT_FREEZE is passed, PTE will be set to migration entry, which is the same
behavior as PMD-mapped page. Then remap_page restore those migration entry
back.

This shows PMD-mapped and PTE-mapped page share the same result on split.

While difference is who sets PTE as migration entry

  * __split_huge_pmd_locked does this job for PMD-mapped page
  * try_to_unmap_one does this job for PTE-mapped page

2. Now let's take a look at the HWPOISON case.

There are two critical differences 

  * __split_huge_pmd_locked is skipped for PTE-mapped page
  * HWPOISON effects the behavior of try_to_unmap_one

Then for PMD-mapped page, HWPOISON has no effect on split. But for PTE-mapped
page, all PTE will be set to hwpoison entry.

Then in memory_failure, the page split will have two different PTE result.

Not sure I explain it clearly.
