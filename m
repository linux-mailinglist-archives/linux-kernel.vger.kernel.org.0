Yes, this is a known problem and people have already tried to address it
in the past. Have you checked previous attempts? SRCU based one
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/153365347929.19074.12509495712735843805.stgit@localhost.localdomain
but I believe there were others (I only had this one in my notes).
Please make sure to Cc Dave Chinner when posting a next version because
he had some concerns about the change of the behavior.

The reference count part makes sense to me. RCU role needs a better
explanation. Also do you have any reason to not use completion for
the final step? Openconding essentially the same concept sounds a bit
awkward to me.

Are NFS people aware of this? Because this is simply not acceptable
behavior. Memory reclaim cannot be block indefinitely or for a long
time. There must be a way to simply give up if the underlying inode
cannot be reclaimed.

I still have to think about the proposed solution. It sounds a bit over
complicated to me.
