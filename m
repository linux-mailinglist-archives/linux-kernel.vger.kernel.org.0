the stream has no notion of device, it can be made of multiple devices, 
so which one would you choose?

They are not all duplicates.

Again, if I remove the logs in stream.c, then I do lose valuable 
information on bad state machines transitions, etc. An error code is not 
enough to reconstruct the issues from intel.c

If I remove the logs in intel.c, I can't know which dai had an error and 
what caused it.

seriously, these are all details, you have over 50 patches to review 
with a complete rework of this subsystem and we argue about dev_err 
verbosity?
