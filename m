zynq>


UBI/UBI-FS test is also passed.
i.e.,
UBI/UBIFS storage test on mtd2 as example
1. ubiformat /dev/mtd2
2. ubiattach /dev/ubi_ctrl -m 2
3. ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N ubifs -m
4. mknod -m 777 /dev/ubi0 c 244 0
5. mount -t ubifs ubi0_0 /mnt/ubifs
6. copy a file to /mnt/ubifs
7. sync and power off - on cycle
8. ubiattach & mount /mnt/ubifs
9. read file and compare it with md5sum

thanks & best regards,
Mason
