     identifier

"passed from consumers": How? Where?
But I want to repeat: We should not allow this. This is a binding for a mailbox controller driver, not a generic firmware backdoor.
We should be as strict as possible to avoid any security issues.
The firmware certainly knows the function ID it implements. The firmware controls the DT. So it is straight-forward to put the ID into the DT. The firmware could even do this at boot time, dynamically, before passing on the DT to the non-secure world (bootloader or kernel).

What would be the use case of this functionality?

I am not particularly happy with this, but well ...

Why is this "1"? What is this number used for? It used to be the channel ID, but since you are describing a single channel controller only, this should be 0 now.

As mentioned above, should be 0.

First: having "optional" in a specific example is not helpful, just confusing.
Second: It is actually *not* optional in this case, as there is no other way of propagating the function ID. The SCMI driver as the mailbox client has certainly no clue about this.
I think I said this previously: Relying on the mailbox client to pass the function ID sounds broken, as this is a property of the mailbox controller driver. The mailbox client does not care about this mailbox communication detail, it just wants to trigger the mailbox.

... and here just <&smc_tx_mbox>; would suffice.
