I'm not sure that CONFIG_DEBUG_PER_CPU_MAPS=y will help you here.

__set_cpus_allowed_ptr(...)
{
    ...
    dest_cpu = cpumask_any_and(...)
    ...
}

With:

#define cpumask_any_and(mask1, mask2) cpumask_first_and((mask1), (mask2))
#define cpumask_first_and(src1p, src2p) cpumask_next_and(-1, (src1p),
(src2p))

cpumask_next_and() is called with n = -1 and in this case does not
invoke cpumask_check().

---

BTW, I can recreate the issue quite easily with:

  qemu-system-x86_64 ... -smp cores=64 ... -enable-kvm

with the default kernel config.
