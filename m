I think that was written before the era of support for hot-pluggable
host bridges and loadable drivers for them.

I think we *do* need support for unregistering regions because we do
claim to support hot-pluggable host bridges, and the I/O port regions
below them should go away when the host bridge does.

Could you just move the logic_pio_register_range() call farther down
in hisi_lpc_probe()?  IIUC, once logic_pio_register_range() returns,
an inb() with the right port number will try to access that port, so
we should be prepared for that, i.e., maybe this in the wrong order to
begin with?

OK, I don't really like code that looks "obviously wrong" but has
extenuating circumstances that need explanation because it sows
confusion and can get copied elsewhere.  But I'm just kibbitzing here
since I don't maintain this, so it's up to you.

That's good.

You might consider a subject line that includes key words like "avoid
use-after-free" or some similar higher-level description that tells
the reader *why* this change is important.
