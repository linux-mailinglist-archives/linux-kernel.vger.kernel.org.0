It emulates as if the data is from real hardware. For ex; suppose a
GPS receiver sends through UART interface.
GUI application simply opens /dev/ttyUSB0 and gets the MNEA strings.
Through this driver we can create pair /dev/ttyvs0<--/dev/ttyvs1 where
test app will write fake
data to /de/vttyvs0 while the GUI app (under testing) will receive it.
This way dependency on
the hardware can be removed to certain extent.
Furthermore, suppose the GPS receiver uses 8N1 with even parity. UART
driver on host
reads a register and finds that parity error has happened. To emulate
this we expose a
sysfs node to user space. Test script can write '1' to this and driver
will insert TTY-PARITY
in the tty buffer.

I have updated the driver to use configfs and tested. Thanks for the guidance.

Yes, testing user space programs. There are other use cases as well.
IoT Smart nursery project: decoupling App, middleware and board
Board gets data from 5 sensors. It sends this data to Host PC (GUI
app) thorough RS-232 serial port.
Same board now located at a remote site will collect data and send to
server through internet.
The middleware running on server will receive and write it to /dev/ttyvs0.
GUI app will open /de/vttyvs1 and gets this data. This way GUI app can
work seamlessly
in both local and remote setup. Similarly, dependency on board is also removed.

I need to learn something here. Do you mean we should avoid add
parameters completely.
Or if possible we should avoid in general. However, if there is a
reason we can use parameters.

I am removing them anyway as configfs view will go out of sync.

This is just an example. It completely depends upon end user to write udev rule.

Using numbers allowed me to write a switch case statement to handle
all possible values. Should I replace them with string to make
more user friendly.

Okay, I will merge with event file itself.

Let me give an example of faulty cable itself. We were testing a fleet
tracker. During
field testing a cable become loose and we lost some of the data.
Because there was
no logic written to handle this corner case, middleware could not detect this.
