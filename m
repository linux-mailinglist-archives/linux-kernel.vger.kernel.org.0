Ok, that makes sense.

As I see it, there is no reason to put the syscon-cells property into any node,
as this is implied by the driver binding using the syscon reference.  I would
only use the #xyz-cells style property if there are multiple interpretations
that all make sense for the same binding.

This sounds better to me, yes. I had not even remembered this function
exists, but I think this is a good idea.

I can also see a point in favor of adding more infrastructure around this,
possibly naming the entries in a syscon-names property as you suggested,
combining of_parse_phandle_with_fixed_args() with a name, or
combining with syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() for convenience.

This should all be possible without adding complexity to the syscon
DT binding itself, and it would give more structure to the way it
is used by drivers.
