Hmm, apparently it's not *exactly* equivalent, since the ACL is missing INVAL
and JOIN permission for the owner, while those were originally granted by SEARCH
permission.  We don't need those, but just to keep the merge resolution itself
as boring as possible, can you please use the following to make it equivalent:

static struct key_acl fsverity_acl = {
	.usage	= REFCOUNT_INIT(1),
	.nr_ace	= 2,
	.aces = {
		KEY_POSSESSOR_ACE(KEY_ACE_SEARCH | KEY_ACE_JOIN |
				  KEY_ACE_INVAL),
		KEY_OWNER_ACE(KEY_ACE_VIEW | KEY_ACE_READ | KEY_ACE_WRITE |
			      KEY_ACE_SEARCH | KEY_ACE_SET_SECURITY |
			      KEY_ACE_INVAL | KEY_ACE_REVOKE | KEY_ACE_JOIN |
			      KEY_ACE_CLEAR),
	}
};


Thanks!
