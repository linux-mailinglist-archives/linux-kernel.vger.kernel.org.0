Yes, either allocating it on percpu area or allocating arraies
on percpu pointer is OK. e.g.

	instance_size = sizeof(*rp->pcpu) + rp->data_size;
	rp->pcpu = __alloc_percpu(instance_size * array_size,
				  __alignof__(*rp->pcpu));

And we will search free ri on the percpu array by checking ri->rp == NULL.
