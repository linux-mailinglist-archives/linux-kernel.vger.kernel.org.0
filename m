random idea: Since these things are much easier to understand by looking at a graph
of util over time, we may agree on some mailing-list-friendly way to convey graphs.
For example, a simple CSV with:
* before/after delimiters (line of # or =)
* graph title
* one point per signal transition, so that it can be plotted with gnuplot style "steps" or matplotlib drawstyle='steps-post'
* consistent column names:
    - time: in seconds (scientific notation for nanoseconds)
    - activation: 1 when the task is actually running, 0 otherwise
     (so it can be turned into transparent coloured bands like using gnuplot filledcurves, like in [1])
    - util: util_avg of the task being talked about

The delimiters allow writing a scripts to render graphs directly out of an mbox file or ML archive URL.
This won't solve the issue for the commit message itself, but that may ease the ML discussions.
