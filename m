Well, as long as we're counting bits, I've taken 21 bits (!) to track
"gupers". :)  More accurately, I'm sharing 31 bits with get_page()...please
see my recently posted patchset for tracking dma-pinned pages:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20191030224930.3990755-1-jhubbard@nvidia.com

Once that is merged, you will have this available:

   static inline bool page_dma_pinned(struct page *page);

...which will reliably track dma-pinned pages.

After that, we still need to convert a some more call sites (block/bio 
in particular) to the new pin_user_pages()/put_user_page() system, in 
order for filesystems to take advantage of it, but this approach has 
the advantage of actually tracking such pages, rather than faking it by 
hoping that there is only one gup caller at a time.

ohhh...no, that's definitely not a claim you can make.

I think you must have missed the many contentious debates about the
tension between gup-pinned pages, and writeback. File systems can't
just ignore writeback in all cases. This patch leads to either
system hangs or filesystem corruption, in the presence of long-lasting
gup pins.

Really, this won't work. sorry.
