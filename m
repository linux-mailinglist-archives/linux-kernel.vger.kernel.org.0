But people without kernel.org accounts could still vote in person before,
right?

Obviously the next step beyond "has a kernel.org account" is "is listed
in MAINTAINERS".  All of these can be assumed to be real humans, too.
However, that's still more restrictive than before, as it rules out people
who are not maintainers.

So next step would be developers/maintainers with an SoB.  I think it's still
safe to assume they are real humans, too.
Add a minimum number of commits[*] to raise the bar a little bit, and avoid
the whitespace-fixers who just want to vote.

[*] And e.g. count commits more than one year ago half, more than N years
    ago 1/2^N.  Perhaps add another penalty for staging cleanups ;-)

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
