I ignore folks who don't use their real name - this is since Usenet

And that's a point which is completely wrong: the only *defined*
interface of the kernel is sys-calls, /proc and similar. And all of this
is from user-space to kernel-space and back.

There is no (and never was) a "defined interface" within the kernel
(inter-operating in kernel space) in any direction simply because the
kernel-internal (infra)structure changes more or less constantly - some
may call that evolution;-)

And I don't get what an "open interface" here couls seriously mean. You
surely don't want to call the list of the GPL_EXPORTed C functions
(which may change from one kernel version to the next) an "open
interface" (whatever that should suggest).

At most the list of GPL_EXPORTed C functions is a de-facto interface and
that may change from one git-commit to the next.

And you are barking up the wrong tree. The discussion has to happen in
the ZFS-world so that they fix their license if they want to interface
with any GPL software (without sys-calls etc. in between - WTF it works
via FUSE) like they seen to do now.

And no, I'm not a lawyer so I won't comment more on the law-aspects -
the above is my short summary of discussions hereover about license
clashes etc. over the last decades ...
