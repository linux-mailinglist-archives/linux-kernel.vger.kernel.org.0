I can't say I'm thrilled with the idea of going back to hack into the
OSDs code again, I was hoping to be able to handle this with the
information we already have on the connection peer_features field.  It
took me *months* to have the OSD fix merged in so I'm not really
convinced a change to the osdmap would make it into Octopus :-)

(But I'll have a look at this and see if I can understand what moving or
replicating the field in the osdmap would really entail.)

Ok, makes sense.

And thanks a lot for your feedback, Ilya.
