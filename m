Ok, I'm back on this topic. Let me look at the latest code and see how
it works on a qcom platform I have in hand. If the device links look OK
then it should be good. I also want to make sure we're not holding a
nested pile of locks when we're adding the device links so that we don't
get some weird lockdep problems.
