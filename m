The hardware is what it is. The ACPI spec is what it is.

I am just pragmatic and making platforms work with that's available 
*today*, and I don't have time or interest in revisiting what might have 
been.

We've been discussing this since October, I don't really have any 
appetite for looking into new concepts when the existing framework just 
does what we need.

It's really down to your objection to the use of 'struct driver'... For 
ASoC support we only need the .name and .pm_ops, so there's really no 
possible path forward otherwise.

Like I said, we have 3 options

a) stay with platform devices for now. You will need to have a 
conversation with Greg on this.

b) use a minimal sdw_master_device with a minimal 'struct driver' use.

c) use a more elaborate solution suggested in this patchset and yes that 
means the Qualcomm driver would need to change a bit.

Pick one or suggest something that is implementable. The first version 
of the patches was provided in October, the last RFC was provided on 
January 31, time's up. At the moment you are preventing ASoC integration 
from moving forward.

Thanks
-Pierre
