The problem is not fs/file.c; it's the code that does (read-only)
access to *other* threads' ->files.  procfs, SAK, some cgroup
shite (pardon the redundancy)...  All of those rely upon task_lock.

FWIW, having just grepped around, I'm worried about the crap io_uring
is pulling off - interplay with unshare(2) could be unpleasant.

In any case - task_lock in the code that assigns to ->files (and it's
not just unshare_files()) serves to protect the 3rd-party readers
(including get_files_struct()) from having the fucker taken apart
under them.  It's not just freeing the thing - it's the entire
close_files().

And no, we do *NOT* want to convert everything to get_files_struct() +
being clever in it.  I would rather have get_files_struct() taken
out and shot, TBH - the only real reason it hadn't been killed years
ago is the loop in proc_readfd_common()...

I'd prefer to have 3rd-party readers indicate their interest
in a way that would be distinguishable from normal references,
with close_files() waiting until all of those are gone.  One way
to do that would be
	* secondary counter in files_struct
	* rcu-delayed freeing of actual structure (not a problem)
	* rcu_read_lock in 3rd-party readers (among other things
it means that proc_readfd_common() would need to be rearchitected
a bit)
	* close_files() starting with subtraction of large constant
from the secondary counter and then spinning until it gets to
-<large constant>
	* 3rd-party readers (under rcu_read_lock()) fetching task->files,
bumping the secondary counter unless it's negative, doing their thing,
then decrementing the counter.
