I managed to reproduce following scenario.

1. Boot the system up to UI
2. Connect TB16 dock (and see that it gets authorized by bolt)
3. Connect keyboard and mouse to the TB16 dock
4. Both mouse and keyboard are functional
5. Enter s2idle by closing laptop lid
6. Exit s2idle by opening the laptop lid
7. After ~10 seconds or so the mouse or keyboard or both do not work
   anymore. They do not respond but they are still "present".

The above does not happen always but from time to time.

Is this the scenario you see as well?

This is on Ubuntu 19.10 with the 5.3 stock kernel.

I can get them work again by unplugging them and plugging back (leaving
the TBT16 dock connected). Also if you run lspci when the problem
occurs it still shows the dock so PCIe link stays up.

I suspect this has something to do with the ASMEDIA xHCI controller but
I'm not an expert so Mathias CC'd.
