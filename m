If you want to see an example of how to do changes in the display mode
(like refresh rate, I have no idea what you mean with VFP, just
guessing) look at i915. We clear drm_crtc_state->mode_changed if it's
a mode change we can handle without a full modeset. That gives you
userspace-controlled variable refresh rate.

The VRR properties are for true VRR, i.e. the hw (with or without help
of the kernel) decides how long to make each vblank for every frame
individually, within certain limitats set by the monitor in its EDID
(or for panels maybe in DT).

If you write a specific userspace, you can just hardcode assumptions
about what the kernel/hw can/cannot do. That's essentially what all
the gl drivers do between kernel/userspace: They just know what the
other side expects.

Wrt making this more generically useful as hints: I've shared a patch
series with Liviu about what I think should be done here instead:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~danvet/drm/log/?h=for-nashpa

Commit message each have a bunch of thoughts. But fundamentally atomic
is meant to be used together with TEST_ONLY and following hints from
the driver. So if you never want to use TEST_ONLY (it's only needed
for transitions, not for every frame) in your stack, then life is
going to be very painful indeed.
