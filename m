For 'struct sort_entry' objects, do you mean I should reuse the 
"sort_dso" which has been implemented yet in util/sort.c?

For other columns, it looks we can't reuse the existing sort_entry objects.

Yes, all in this call.

In sample processing, we just get all symbols and account the cycles per 
symbol. We need to create/count the block_info at some points after the 
sample processing.

Maybe it's not very good to put block info setup/count/print in a call, 
but it's really not easy to process the block_info during the sample 
processing.
