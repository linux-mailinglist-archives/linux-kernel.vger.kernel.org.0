This looks like a very specific use case. But the proposal changes
the behavior for anyone. I am not persuaded that everyone would
appreciate the change.

OK, it takes 60 seconds when the messages appear on the console and
1 second when they are just stored to the syslog.

Why the system is configured to show all messages on the console
when syslog is enough?

If sysrq is the preferred interface, it might be used also the other
way. I mean to increase console_loglevel to hide all messages on
the console, trigger output of the system state and eventually
decrease the loglevel again.

Always deferring printk() for everyone is not acceptable. It is one
extreme between printk() reliability and speed in favor of the speed.
But many people prefer reliability (high chance to see messages
when the system goes down.

IMHO, the only acceptable solution need to be configurable:

   + never deffer (debugging corner cases?)
   + avoid softlockup (default on normal systems?)
   + guarantee max time (throughput oriented systems)
   + always deffer (real time, special usecases)

It might be based on Sergey's patchsets adding the offload logic
into console_unlock().

IMHO, the most problematic thing is how to define the limit
(lines?, characters?, time?). A limit bases on the data amount
would also depend on console speed. Time based limit would be
better but measuring time in console_unlock() is problematic
(atomic context, possible deadlocks).
