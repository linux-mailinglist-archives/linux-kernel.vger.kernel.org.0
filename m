I really struggled to find a way to label the code in order to document
the memory barriers. By grepping on "jA:" you will land at the exact
location.

I tried to be very careful about the labeling, but you just found an
error. cD is supposed to be cC. (I probably refactored the labels and
missed this one.) Particularly with referencing labels from other files
I was not happy (which is the case with cC). This is one area that I
think it would be really helpful if the kernel guidelines had some
format.

The labels are necessary for the technical documentation of the
barriers. And, after spending much time in this, I find them very
useful. But I agree that there needs to be a better way to assign label
names.

FWIW, I chose a lowercase letter for each function and an uppercase
letter for each label within that function. The camel case (followed by
the colon) created a pair that was unique for grepping.

Petr, in case you missed it, this comment language came from my
discussion[0] with AndreaP.

Yeah, I spent a lot of time going in circles on this one.

I hope that we can agree that the labels are important. And that a
formal documentation of the barriers is also important. Yes, they are a
lot of work, but I find it makes it a lot easier to go back to the code
after I've been away for a while. Even now, as I go through your
feedback on code that I wrote over a month ago, I find the formal
comments critical to quickly understand _exactly_ why the memory
barriers exist.

Perhaps we should choose labels that are more clear, like:

    dataring_push:A
    dataring_push:B

Then we would see comments like:

    Memory barrier involvement:

    If _dataring_pop:B reads from dataring_datablock_setid:A, then
    _dataring_pop:C reads from dataring_push:G.

    If _dataring_pop:B reads from dataring_datablock_setid:A, then
    _dataring_pop:D reads from dataring_push:H.

    If _dataring_pop:B reads from dataring_datablock_setid:A, then
    _dataring_pop:E reads from dataring_push:E.

    Note that if _dataring_pop:B reads from dataring_datablock_setid:A, then
    _dataring_pop:C cannot read from dataring_push:C->dataring_desc_init:A.

    Note that if _dataring_pop:B reads from dataring_datablock_setid:A, then
    _dataring_pop:D cannot read from dataring_push:C->dataring_desc_init:B.

    Relies on:

    RELEASE from dataring_push:G to dataring_datablock_setid:A
       matching
    ADDRESS DEP. from _dataring_pop:B to _dataring_pop:C

    RELEASE from dataring_push:H to dataring_datablock_setid:A
       matching
    ADDRESS DEP. from _dataring_pop:B to _dataring_pop:D

    RELEASE from dataring_push:E to dataring_datablock_setid:A
       matching
    ACQUIRE from _dataring_pop:B to _dataring_pop:E

But then how should the labels in the code look? Just the letter looks
simple in code, but cannot be grepped.

    dataring_push()
    {
        ...
        /* E */
        ...
    }

The full label can be grepped, but is redundant with the function name.

    dataring_push()
    {
        ...
        /* dataring_push:E */
        ...
    }

Andrea suggested that the documentation should be within the code, which
I think is a good idea. Even if it means we have more comments than
code.

I am open to suggestions.
