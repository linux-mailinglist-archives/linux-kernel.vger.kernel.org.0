ARM64_HAS_NO_FPSIMD is really a disability, not a capability.

Although we have other things that smell like this (CPU errata for
example), I wonder whether inverting the meaning in the case would
make the situation easier to understand.

So, we'd have ARM64_HAS_FPSIMD, with a minimum (signed) feature field
value of 0.  Then this just looks like an ARM64_CPUCAP_SYSTEM_FEATURE
IIUC.  We'd just need to invert the sense of the check in
system_supports_fpsimd().

(Does .min_field_value == 0 make sense, or is it even used?  I thought
only the default has_cpuid_feature() match logic uses that.)
