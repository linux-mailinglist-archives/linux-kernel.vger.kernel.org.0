Many of the resources tied to mm_struct are indeed freed when mm_users
becomes 0 including swap space reservation, I think. I was testing a mm
patch and it did have a missing mmput bug that cause mm_users not going
to 0. I fixed the bug, and with sched patch to speed up the release the
mm_struct, every was fine. I didn't realize that fixing the mm bug is
enough to free the swap space.

Still there are some resources not being free when the mm_count is
non-zero. It is certainly less serious than what I have thought. Sorry
for the confusion.

Cheers,
Longman
