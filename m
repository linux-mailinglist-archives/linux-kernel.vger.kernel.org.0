I read this as as "User-space [...] needs to write to vmcoreinfo".

I disagree. Everything and anything in the kernel will change. The ABI rules apply to
stuff exposed via syscalls and kernel filesystems. It does not apply to kernel internals,
like the memory layout we used yesterday. 14c127c957c1 is a case in point.

A debugger trying to rely on this sort of thing would have to play catchup whenever it
changes.

I'm looking for a justification that isn't paper-thin. Putting 'for guessing the memory
map' in the commit message gives the impression we can support that.

Don't trust the header jungle!

Missing declaration?

Here it is! (I must be going mad...)
