Subject: [PATCH 1/2] f2fs: delete duplicate information on sysfs nodes
From:   Hridya Valsaraju <hridya@google.com>
To:     Jaegeuk Kim <jaegeuk@kernel.org>, Chao Yu <yuchao0@huawei.com>,
        Jonathan Corbet <corbet@lwn.net>,
        linux-f2fs-devel@lists.sourceforge.net,
        linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, linux-doc@vger.kernel.org
Cc:     kernel-team@android.com, Hridya Valsaraju <hridya@google.com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch merges the sysfs node documentation present in
Documentation/filesystems/f2fs.txt and
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-fs-f2fs
and deletes the duplicate information from
Documentation/filesystems/f2fs.txt. This is to prevent having to update
both files when a new sysfs node is added for f2fs.
The patch also makes minor formatting changes to
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-fs-f2fs.

-                              & setting gc_idle = 2 will select the greedy approach.
-
- gc_urgent                    This parameter controls triggering background GCs
-                              urgently or not. Setting gc_urgent = 0 [default]
-                              makes back to default behavior, while if it is set
-                              to 1, background thread starts to do GC by given
-                              gc_urgent_sleep_time interval.
-
- reclaim_segments             This parameter controls the number of prefree
-                              segments to be reclaimed. If the number of prefree
-			      segments is larger than the number of segments
-			      in the proportion to the percentage over total
-			      volume size, f2fs tries to conduct checkpoint to
-			      reclaim the prefree segments to free segments.
-			      By default, 5% over total # of segments.
-
- max_small_discards	      This parameter controls the number of discard
-			      commands that consist small blocks less than 2MB.
-			      The candidates to be discarded are cached until
-			      checkpoint is triggered, and issued during the
-			      checkpoint. By default, it is disabled with 0.
-
- discard_granularity	      This parameter controls the granularity of discard
-			      command size. It will issue discard commands iif
-			      the size is larger than given granularity. Its
-			      unit size is 4KB, and 4 (=16KB) is set by default.
-			      The maximum value is 128 (=512KB).
 
- reserved_blocks	      This parameter indicates the number of blocks that
-			      f2fs reserves internally for root.
-
- batched_trim_sections	      This parameter controls the number of sections
-                              to be trimmed out in batch mode when FITRIM
-                              conducts. 32 sections is set by default.
-
- ipu_policy                   This parameter controls the policy of in-place
-                              updates in f2fs. There are five policies:
-                               0x01: F2FS_IPU_FORCE, 0x02: F2FS_IPU_SSR,
-                               0x04: F2FS_IPU_UTIL,  0x08: F2FS_IPU_SSR_UTIL,
-                               0x10: F2FS_IPU_FSYNC.
-
- min_ipu_util                 This parameter controls the threshold to trigger
-                              in-place-updates. The number indicates percentage
-                              of the filesystem utilization, and used by
-                              F2FS_IPU_UTIL and F2FS_IPU_SSR_UTIL policies.
-
- min_fsync_blocks             This parameter controls the threshold to trigger
-                              in-place-updates when F2FS_IPU_FSYNC mode is set.
-			      The number indicates the number of dirty pages
-			      when fsync needs to flush on its call path. If
-			      the number is less than this value, it triggers
-			      in-place-updates.
-
- min_seq_blocks		      This parameter controls the threshold to serialize
-			      write IOs issued by multiple threads in parallel.
-
- min_hot_blocks		      This parameter controls the threshold to allocate
-			      a hot data log for pending data blocks to write.
-
- min_ssr_sections	      This parameter adds the threshold when deciding
-			      SSR block allocation. If this is large, SSR mode
-			      will be enabled early.
-
- ram_thresh                   This parameter controls the memory footprint used
-			      by free nids and cached nat entries. By default,
-			      10 is set, which indicates 10 MB / 1 GB RAM.
-
- ra_nid_pages		      When building free nids, F2FS reads NAT blocks
-			      ahead for speed up. Default is 0.
-
- dirty_nats_ratio	      Given dirty ratio of cached nat entries, F2FS
-			      determines flushing them in background.
-
- max_victim_search	      This parameter controls the number of trials to
-			      find a victim segment when conducting SSR and
-			      cleaning operations. The default value is 4096
-			      which covers 8GB block address range.
-
- migration_granularity	      For large-sized sections, F2FS can stop GC given
-			      this granularity instead of reclaiming entire
-			      section.
-
- dir_level                    This parameter controls the directory level to
-			      support large directory. If a directory has a
-			      number of files, it can reduce the file lookup
-			      latency by increasing this dir_level value.
-			      Otherwise, it needs to decrease this value to
-			      reduce the space overhead. The default value is 0.
-
- cp_interval		      F2FS tries to do checkpoint periodically, 60 secs
-			      by default.
-
- idle_interval		      F2FS detects system is idle, if there's no F2FS
-			      operations during given interval, 5 secs by
-			      default.
-
- discard_idle_interval	      F2FS detects the discard thread is idle, given
-			      time interval. Default is 5 secs.
-
- gc_idle_interval	      F2FS detects the GC thread is idle, given time
-			      interval. Default is 5 secs.
-
- umount_discard_timeout       When unmounting the disk, F2FS waits for finishing
-			      queued discard commands which can take huge time.
-			      This gives time out for it, 5 secs by default.
-
- iostat_enable		      This controls to enable/disable iostat in F2FS.
-
- readdir_ra		      This enables/disabled readahead of inode blocks
-			      in readdir, and default is enabled.
-
- gc_pin_file_thresh	      This indicates how many GC can be failed for the
-			      pinned file. If it exceeds this, F2FS doesn't
-			      guarantee its pinning state. 2048 trials is set
-			      by default.
-
- extension_list		      This enables to change extension_list for hot/cold
-			      files in runtime.
-
- inject_rate		      This controls injection rate of arbitrary faults.
-
- inject_type		      This controls injection type of arbitrary faults.
-
- dirty_segments 	      This shows # of dirty segments.
-
- lifetime_write_kbytes	      This shows # of data written to the disk.
-
- features		      This shows current features enabled on F2FS.
-
- current_reserved_blocks      This shows # of blocks currently reserved.
-
- unusable                     If checkpoint=disable, this shows the number of
-                              blocks that are unusable.
-                              If checkpoint=enable it shows the number of blocks
-                              that would be unusable if checkpoint=disable were
-                              to be set.
