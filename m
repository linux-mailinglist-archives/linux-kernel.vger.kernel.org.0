I was interpreting Scott's question (which would be excluded from the
git commit log) as relating to a possible follow-on patch.

The question is "how special can non-raw spinlocks be in -rt?".  From what
I can see, they have been treated as sleeplocks from an RCU viewpoint,
so maybe that should continue to be the case.  It does deserve some
thought because in mainline a non-raw spinlock really would block a
post-consolidation RCU grace period, even in PREEMPT kernels.

But then again, you cannot preempt a non-raw spinlock in mainline but
you can in -rt, so extending that exception to RCU is not unreasonable.

Either way, we do need to make a definite decision and document it.
If I were forced to make a decision right now, I would follow the old
behavior, so that only raw spinlocks were guaranteed to block RCU grace
periods.  But I am not being forced, so let's actually discuss and make
a conscious decision.  ;-)

							Thanx, Paul
