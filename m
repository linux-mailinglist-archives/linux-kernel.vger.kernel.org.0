We can't derive the configuration from hardware, and its something that 
is currently a priori known since the host (linux) needs to initialize 
the hardware with the configuration before it can communicate with the 
device (ie the on device FW).

99% of the time the configuration is fixed, however there have been 
instances where features have been added on the device, which result in 
new channels, which then impact the configuration.  In the cases I'm 
aware of this, both sides were updated in lockstep.  I don't know how 
upstream would handle it.  I'm thinking we can ignore that case until it 
comes up.

DT/ACPI is tricky, since the cases where we want this currently are 
essentially standalone PCI(e) cards.  Those are likely to be on systems 
which don't support DT (ie x86), and there really isn't a place in ACPI 
to put PCI(e) device configuration information, since its supposed to be 
a discoverable bus.

There are hardware limitations to the configuration, and that varies 
from device to device.  Since the host (linux) programs the 
configuration into the hardware, its possible for an invalid 
configuration to be programed, but I would expect that in the majority 
of cases (ie programming a channel that the device FW doesn't know 
about), there is no adverse impact.
