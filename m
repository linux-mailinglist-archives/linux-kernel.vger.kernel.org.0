At least serial & clock needs to be correct for uart to work so that 
useful debug information can be displayed.

If I understand you correctly, you want a kernel command line with fixed 
initrd location set in chosen node that U-Boot can pass on to kernel ?

If that's the case, that's not feasible as everybody's kernel command 
line may not be same and will probably override it using CONFIG_CMDLINE.

So I don't see the point int setting a fixed one. What's the advantage 
in doing that ?
