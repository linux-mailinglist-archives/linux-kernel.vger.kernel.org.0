According to your suggestions, we should do like this:
1. call reserve_crashkernel_low() at the beginning of reserve_crashkernel()
2. mark the low region as 'nomap'
3. use crashk_low_res.end to change some limit variable from ARCH_LOW_ADDRESS_LIMIT to
memblock_end_of_DRAM()
4. rename crashk_low_res as "Crash kernel (low)" for arm64
5. add an 'linux,low-memory-range' node in DT

Do i understand correctly?
