I guess we can ignore memory overhead. I guess there only might be some concern
that for nodes that are initially offline, we will allocate the pgdat on a
different node, and after they are online, it will stay on a different node with
more access latency from local cpus. If we only allocate for online nodes, it
can always be local? But I guess it doesn't matter that much.
