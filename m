Yeah, there are no very good approach to estimate the numa efficiency
since there are no per-task counter to tell the local & remote accessing
on hardware level, numa balancing won't cover all the cases, otherwise
we will have overhead issue again.

Well, at least we will be able to know whether this feature itself is
working well or not by reading locality, especially for cross nodes
workloads, locality could at least tell us the numa balancing is helping,
or just wasting resources :-P

Sounds fair enough, no such tool yet.

That's right, will highlight in the doc.
