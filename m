Well, "__lockfree" means the variable will be accessed without holding a
lock, most likely in a lock-free algorithm. But I admit I haven't
thought too much about the name, so maybe it's a bad one ;-)

Understood. I don't have any objection to your goal, and I think
achieving that will really help developers.

By introducing annotations as __lockfree/__nonatomic, won't it help pass
the understanding between developers? "the next person" should learn
about the design by reading the code (or document) rather than adding
some random code and see if KCSAN yells.

Just to be clear, my initial thought of introduing the annotation is to
have a better way to document the variable that cannot be accessed
"plainly" in a non mutual-exclusive environment, so that the fixes that
add READ_ONCE or WRITE_ONCE to accesses of those variables should be
considered useful.

Yeah, this one is a "forgotten lock" case in the wild.

Thank you both for the information!
