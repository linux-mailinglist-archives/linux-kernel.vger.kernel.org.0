Let's discuss deferred_grow_zone after this all settles down. I still
have to study it because I wasn't aware that this is actually a page
allocator path relying on the resize lock. My recollection was that the
resize lock is only about memory hotplug. Your patches flew by and I
didn't have time to review them back then. So I have to admit I have
seen the resize lock too simple.
