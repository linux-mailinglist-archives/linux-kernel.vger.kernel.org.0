But if it's a generic flag, how do you combine that with other
modifiers? Like if you have a tiled buffer, but also encrypted? Or
afbc compressed, or whatever else. I'd expect for your hw encryption
is orthogonal to the buffer/tiling/compression format used?

That was clear, but for the full picture we also need to know how
these buffers are produced and where they are allocated. One approach
would be to have a dma-buf heap that gives you encrypted buffers back.
With that we need to make sure that only encryption-aware drivers
allow such buffers to be imported, and the entire problem becomes a
kernel-internal one - aside from allocating the right kind of buffer
at the right place.

Yeah I expect there's more than just arm wanting this. I also wonder
how that interacts with the secure memory allocator that was bobbing
around on dri-devel for a while, but seems to not have gone anywhere.
That thing implemented my idea of "secure memory is only allocated by
a special entity".
