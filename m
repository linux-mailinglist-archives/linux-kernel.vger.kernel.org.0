Yeah, PTI was quite annoying.  Still is, from what I can see.  :-/

OK, thank you!  I will put a tag into -rcu marking its removal in case
it should prove useful whenever for whatever.

Joel, would you like to remove this, or would you rather that I did?
It is in code you are working with right now, so if I do it, I need to
wait until yours is finalized.  Which wouldn't be a problem.

						Thanx, Paul
