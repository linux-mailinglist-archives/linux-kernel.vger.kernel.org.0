What you mean is that L1D is flushed before another task which does not
belong to the same trust zone returns to user space or enters guest
mode.

What's the point? The attack surface is the L1D content of the scheduled
out task. If the malicious task schedules out, then why would you care?

I might be missing something, but AFAICT this is beyond paranoia.

It might be the quick fix for the next not yet known variant of L1D
based horrors, so yes it's at least worth to discuss it.

No idea, but I assume in the light of L1D based issues that might be the
case. Though that still is per architecture as the L1D flush mechanisms
are architecture specific. Aside of that I don't think that more than a
few will enable / support it.

If we go there, then the KVM L1D flush code wants to move into general
x86 code.

Yes to static key.

Why so? There are gaps in the TIF flags (18, 23, 26). Why do you want to
push that to 32?

> 6. Should we consider cleaning up the L1D on arrival of tasks?

That's the Ben idea, right? If so see above.

Why not? Even if it wouldn't be necessary why would we care as this is a
once per boot operation in fully preemptible code.

Aside of that why do we need another pointlessly different copy of what
we have in the VMX code?

Lacks an explanation / comment what this smp_mb is for and where the
counterpart lives.

Aside of that, this is pointless AFAICT. Disable/enable is really not a
concern of being perfect. If you want perfect protection, simply switch
off your computer.

Yet moar copied code slighlty different for no reason.

This is really the wrong place. You want to do that:

  1) Just before return to user space
  2) When entering a guest

and only when the previously running user space task was the one which
requested this massive protection.

While it's worth to discuss, I'm not yet convinced that this is worth
the trouble.

Thanks,
