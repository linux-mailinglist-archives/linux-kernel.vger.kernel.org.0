Keeping code refactoring and renaming separate is always better
but its okay, will leave it upto you.

Probably something like bad_page_fetch_reasons() and also this helper
can be expanded to include an additional argument 'bool free' which
can test either PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_FREE or PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_PREP.
This way bad_page_fetch_reasons() is where all possible reasons are
evaluated including page->flags based and then final 'int nr' can be
returned once and for all.

bad_flags does not seem to be needed. Wondering what it adds more
in bad_page() when page->flags gets printed universally through
__dump_page(). In case it is still required, it can be derived
from 'bad_reasons' evaluated in bad_page_fetch_reasons().
