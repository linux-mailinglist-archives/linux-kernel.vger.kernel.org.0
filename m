I don't know what the right answer is here, but keep in mind that
objtool is on by default for x86, so don't be surprised if that
eventually happens to arch64 too.

Short term it might be ok to disable jump tables with objtool enabled,
or to disable objtool when clang is in use, but long term we'll need to
figure out a better solution.
