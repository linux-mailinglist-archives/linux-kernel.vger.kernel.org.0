Yes.

The aligned read/write does already the whole 4-bytes read/write, so
it should work.  But we need confirmation with the actual hardware.

The helper doesn't guarantee the atomic write by itself, so a lock
would be required in the caller side if needed.  Luckily there aren't
many places calling the unaligned access.
