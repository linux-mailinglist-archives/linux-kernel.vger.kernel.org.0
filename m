Now that I look at this again, the above makes sense to me.

I'd requested the current form (which I now realise is broken), since
back in v2 the code looked like:

static void free_pagetable(struct page *page, int order)
{
	...
	free_pages((unsigned long)page_address(page), order);
	...
}

... with callsites looking like:

free_pagetable(pud_page(*pud), get_order(PUD_SIZE));

... which I now see is off by PAGE_SHIFT, and we inherited that bug in
the current code, so the calculated order is vastly larger than it
should be. It's worrying that doesn't seem to be caught by anything in
testing. :/

Anshuman, could you please fold in Steve's suggested change? I'll look
at the rest of the series shortly, so no need to resend that right away,
but it would be worth sorting out.

Thanks,
Mark.
