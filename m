Yes. This really should be a hidden option that just auto-enables. It's
not ideal to require people to both *find* HMM_MIRROR, *and* figure out 
that they need it. (I think it's just this way due to the history of how
HMM got merged--it started off as a kind of experimental sandbox, so
it had it's own config options, to avoid bothering anything else.)

I'll send out a new patch to just auto-select. The WANT_HMM_MIRROR
approach seems accurate, given the (X86_64 || PPC64) complication, probably
after -rc1 is ready (I don't see the ODP code using HMM yet, so that
must not have been merged yet.)

Longer term, I vaguely recall that there is no strong reason preventing 
HMM from being made to work on other arches, and am hoping that it was
just done this way to save development time. I don't want to leave it 
this way unless there's a good reason to.

thanks,
