I think at the moment the calls to rdrand are really not the largest
contributor to the latency. The relocations are the real bottleneck -
each address must be inspected to see if it is in the list of function
sections that have been randomized, and the value at that address must
also be inspected to see if it's in the list of function sections.
That's a lot of lookups. That said, I tried to measure the difference
between using Kees' prng vs. the rdrand calls and found little to no
measurable difference. I think at this point it's in the noise -
hopefully we will get to a point where this matters more.

I will read up on this.
