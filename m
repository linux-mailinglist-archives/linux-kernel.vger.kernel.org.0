Oops... it's just my fault. Will remove it.

Yes, these check should be included for anon.

I'm not sure that this is necessary for anon page. From my understanding,
executable mapped file page is more precious than other mapped file page
because this mapping is usually used by *multiple* thread and there is
no way to check it by MM. If anon JIT code has also such characteristic, th=
is
code should be included for anon, but, should be included separately. It
seems that it's beyond of this patch.

I will rework the code if you agree with my opinion.

My idea is that the pages newly appended to the inactive list, for example,
a newly allocated anon page or deactivated page, start at the same line.
A newly allocated anon page would have a mapping (reference) so I
made this code to help for deactivated page to have a mapping (reference).
I think that there is no reason to devalue the page accessed on active list=
.

Before this patch is applied, all newly allocated anon page are started
at the active list so clearing the pte reference on deactivation is require=
d
to check the further access. However, it is not the case so I skip it here.

It's not. For file page, PageReferenced() is maintained even if deactivatio=
n
happens and it means one reference.

In order to preserve the current behaviour for the file page, I leave the c=
ode
as is for the file page and change the code for the anon page. There is
fundamental difference between them such as how referenced is checked,
accessed by mapping and accessed by syscall. I think that some difference
would be admitted.

Thanks.
