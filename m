correct, it is especially painful on 2+ sockets and many-core systems
when attaching kretprobes on otherwise uncontended paths.

That was my initial implementation, which would not even need the
percpu_instance
flag in struct kretprobe. However, I felt that changing the default
would have subtle
side effects (e.g., only one outstanding call per CPU) so I thought it
would be better
to leave the default unchanged and make the flag explicit.

Can you clarify what you mean by "per-cpu instance array" ?
Do you mean allowing multiple outstanding entries per cpu?

I will address your code comments in an updated patch.

thanks
