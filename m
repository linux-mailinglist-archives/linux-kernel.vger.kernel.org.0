So yea, CMA regions are either configured by DT or setup at build time
(I think there's a cmdline option to set it up as well).

But the CMA regions and the dmabuf cma heap driver are separate
things. The latter uses the former.

??? That's not what I said above.  If the db845c doesn't need CMA it
won't have a CMA region.

The issue at hand is that we may want to avoid loading the dmabuf CMA
heap driver on a board that doesn't use CMA.

That's fine to dispute. I'm not really in a place to assert one way or
not, but the Android folks have made their ION system and CMA heaps
loadable via a module, so it would seem like having the dmabuf system
and CMA heaps be modular would be useful to properly replace that
usage.

For instance, the system heap as a module probably doesn't make much
sense, as most boards that want to use the dmabuf heaps interface are
likely to use that as well.  CMA is more optional as not all boards
will use that one, so it might make sense to avoid loading it.

Sandeep: Can you chime in here as to how critical having the system
and cma heaps be modules are?

No. I'm trying to allow the (hopefully-soon-to-be-in-tree) system and
cma heap drivers to be loaded from a module.
If other heaps need exports, they can submit their heaps upstream and
argue for the exported symbols themselves.

So as Andrew mentioned, he has some dmabuf heaps he's working on at
TI.  From what I've heard the qualcomm folks like the dmabuf heaps
approach, but I'm not sure if they've taken a pass at converting their
vendor ION heaps to it yet.

The main reason I'm only submitting system and CMA is because those
are the only two I personally have a user for (HiKey/HiKey960 boards).
It's my hope that once we deprecate ION in Android, vendors will
migrate and we'll be able to push them to upstream their heaps as
well.

thanks
