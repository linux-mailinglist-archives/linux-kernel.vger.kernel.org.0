Thanks for the review.

One of the few lines removed are actually causing sparse warning,
that's why I changed this together with the sparse fixes.  I can add
all the lines removed in the log for better record.

It probably is cleaner, but also slower for the bd manipulation that
can be in the hot path.  The QE code has been using this way to
access/update the bd status and length together for a long time.  And
I remembered that it could help to prevent synchronization issues for
accessing status and length separately.

It is probably cleaner to change the data structure to use union for
accessing status and length together.  But that will need a big change
to update all the current users of the structure which I don't have
the time to do right now.

Same comment as above.

I would agree with you that is not neccessary to create different enum
types for these bits in the same register in the first place.  But I
would like to prevent aggressive cleanups of this driver for old
hardware that is becoming harder and harder to be thoroughly tested
right now.  These fields are probably not used by the in tree ucc_uart
driver right now.  But as a generic library for QE, I think it is
harmless to keep these simple code there for potentially customized
version of the uart driver or other ucc slow drivers.
