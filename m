From an engineering POV I'd much prefer a single complete allocator over
two half ones. We can leave block merger out of the initial allocator I
suppose and worry about that if/when fragmentation really shows to be a
problem.

I'm thinking worst-fit might work well for our use-case. Best-fit would
result in a heap of tiny fragments and we don't have really large
allocations, which is the Achilles-heel of worst-fit.

Also, since you put in a minimal allocation size of 2, but did not
mandate size is a multiple of 2, there is a weird corner case of size-1
fragments. The simplest case is to leak those, but put in a counter so
we can see if they're a problem -- there is a fairly trivial way to
recover them without going full merge.

Also, there's a bunch of syzcaller reports of running out of
ENTRIES/CHAIN_HLOCKS, perhaps try some of those workloads to better
stress the allocator?
