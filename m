Not really, the NMI will not reach the cmpxchg() in this case.
prb_remove_desc_oldest() will return error. It will not
be able to remove the conflicting descriptor because it will
still be occupied by a two-wraps-old descriptor.

BTW: I did meet these problems in some early variatns. But everything
started working at some point. I always looked how you solved
a particular situation in the link-based approach. Then I
somehow translated it into the pure-array variant.

Thanks for the explanation.

Yup, it sounds reasonable. The number of reserved but not committed
descriptors is basically limited by the number of CPUs.

The only unknown variable is the length of the messages. Which brings
another problem. We might need a solution for continuous lines.
People would want it. Also storing one line in many entries would
be quite inefficient. But let's discuss this later when
printk() gets converted into the lockless ring buffer.

Sure, I am interested to see v3.
