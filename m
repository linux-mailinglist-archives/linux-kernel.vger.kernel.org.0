Unless I am missing an elephant in this whole picture, kernel code
contains 20K+ unaccounted allocations and if I am not mistaken few of
them were audited and are intentionally unaccounted rather than
unaccounted just because it's the default. So if we want DoS
protection, it's really for every kernel developer/maintainer to audit
and fix these allocation sites. And since we have a unikernel, a
single unaccounted allocation may compromise the whole kernel. I
assume we would need something like GFP_UNACCOUNTED to mark audited
allocations that don't need accounting and then slowly reduce number
of allocations without both ACCOUNTED and UNACCOUNTED.

What exactly is this care in practice?
It seems that in a148ce15375fc664ad64762c751c0c2aecb2cafe you just
added it and the allocation is not tied to the process. At least I
don't see any explanation as to why that one is safe, while accounting
other similar allocation is not...
