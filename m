I missed adding a comment here to explain the changes. As discussed in 
the previous series, I think we are ok with this patch from a CMODX 
perspective. For smp_call_function(), I decided to have it included in 
this patch since we know that we need it here for sure. I am not 
entirely sure we want to do that in patch_instruction() since ftrace 
doesn't seem to need it elsewhere. As Nick Piggin pointed out, we may 
want to have users of patch_instruction() (kprobes) add the necessary 
synchronization.


Thanks,
Naveen
