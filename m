Yes, unfortunately. I agree this is is the cleanest solution and my 
first choice. It would work for VMware, but AFAICT it might break setups 
of other hypervisors running at least the vmmouse driver. Quick googling 
tells me there are likely QEMU/KVM setups that do this. My thinking is 
they would have to set X86_FEATURE_VMMCALL on AMD to get the 
kvm_hypercall right, but that would mean the vmmouse hypercall also uses 
vmmcall, which they probably haven't implemented (yet). So the safe way 
would be to use at least XF86_FEATURE_VMW_VMMCALL + XF86_FEATURE_VMCALL 
until that has happened.
