Hi Greg!

It's not a pile of zombie kmem_caches vs a pile of zombie mem_cgroups.
It's a smaller pile of zombie kmem_caches vs a larger pile of zombie kmem_c=
aches
*and* a pile of zombie mem_cgroups. The patchset makes the number of zombie
kmem_caches lower, not bigger.

Re slabinfo and other debug interfaces: I do not change anything here.

I'm not sure we need to add a permanent debug interface, because something =
like
drgn ( https://github.com/osandov/drgn ) can be used instead.

If you think that we lack some necessary debug interfaces, I'm totally open
here, but it's not a part of this patchset. Let's talk about them separatel=
y.

Thank you for looking into it!
