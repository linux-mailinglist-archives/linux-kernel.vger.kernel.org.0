I guess Pierre-Hugues should have access, as he introduced the part?

We use the RN5T567 and I added support for it. Unfortunately I have no
access to the RN5T618 datasheet so I cannot tell. The RN5T567 has both
bits in marked reserved, but looking at how it the enable bit are
distributed otherwise this patch fixes it in the only way it makes
sense...
