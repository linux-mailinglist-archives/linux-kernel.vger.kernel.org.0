I care about the number of open file descriptors because I can't let
multiple processes run simultaneously on my device, as we still don't
have the code to do proper isolation between the processes, in regard
of memory accesses on our device memory and by using our DMA engine.
Basically, it's a security hole. If you want, I can explain more in
length on this issue.

We have the H/W infrastructure for that, using MMU and multiple
address space IDs (ASID), but we didn't write the code yet in the
driver, as that is a BIG feature but it wasn't requested by anyone
yet.

So the current solution is to block the ability to open multiple file
descriptors.

Regarding this specific sysfs property, I don't really care about it.
I simply saw that it is shown in other drivers and I thought it may be
nice for a system admin utility to show it.

Thanks,
Oded
