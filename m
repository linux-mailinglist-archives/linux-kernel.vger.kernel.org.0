Say you have the following tree:

                         root
                       /     \
               system.slice  user.slice
               /    |           |
           cron  journal     user-100.slice
                                |
                             session-c2.scope
                                |          \
                             the_workload  misc

You're saying you want to prioritize the workload above everything
else in the system: system tasks, other users' stuff, even other stuff
running as your own user. Therefor you configure memory.low on the
workload and propagate the value up the tree. So far so good, memory
is protected.

However, what you've really done just now is flattened the resource
hierarchy. You configured the_workload not just more important than
its sibling "misc", but you actually pulled it up the resource tree
and declared it more important than what's running in other sessions,
what users are running, and even the system software. Your cgroup tree
still reflects process ownership, but it doesn't actually reflect the
resource hierarchy you just configured.

And that is something that other controllers do not support: you
cannot give IO weight to the_workload without also making the c2
session more important than other sessions, user 100 more important
than other users, and user.slice more important than system.slice.

Memory is really the only controller in which this kind of works.

And yes, maybe you're talking about a highly specific case where
the_workload is mostly in memory and also doesn't need any IO capacity
and you have CPU to spare, so this is good enough for you and you
don't care about the other controllers in that particular usecase.

But the discussion is about the broader approach to resource control:
if other controllers already require the cgroup hierarchy to reflect
resource hierarchy, memory shouldn't be different just because.

And in practice, most workloads *do* in fact need comprehensive
control. Which workload exclusively needs memory, but no IO, and no
CPU? If you only control for memory, lower priority workloads tend to
eat up your CPU doing reclaim and your IO doing paging.

So when talking about the design and semantics of one controller, you
have to think about this comprehensively.

The proper solution to implement the kind of resource hierarchy you
want to express in cgroup2 is to reflect it in the cgroup tree. Yes,
the_workload might have been started by user 100 in session c2, but in
terms of resources, it's prioritized over system.slice and user.slice,
and so that's the level where it needs to sit:

                               root
                       /        |                 \
               system.slice  user.slice       the_workload
               /    |           |
           cron  journal     user-100.slice
                                |
                             session-c2.scope
                                |
                             misc

Then you can configure not just memory.low, but also a proper io
weight and a cpu weight. And the tree correctly reflects where the
workload is in the pecking order of who gets access to resources.

There is nothing wrong with that, and systemd does it per default. But
it also doesn't enable resource control domains per default.

Once you do split up resource domains, you cannot express both
hierarchies in a single tree. And cgroup2 controllers are designed
such that resource domain hierarchy takes precedence.

It's perfectly fine to launch the workload in a different/new resource
domain. This doesn't conflict with systemd, and is in fact supported
by it. See the Slice= attribute (systemd.resource_control(5)).

Sure you need to be privileged to do this, but you also need to be
privileged to set memory.low on user.slice...
