Some subsystem maintainers react strongly to changelogs that read "this
patch"; it's best to express things in the imperative form described in

These seems like good changes, but they are too much for a single patch.
Please split this into multiple patches, separating the formatting and
white-space changes from those that change the text.  That makes it much
easier to review.

Some nits below.

Heh, yeah, I'm not sure why that's there, it should definitely go.

Remember that we want to preserve the readability of the plain-text
document; sprinkling that sort of escape doesn't really help.  Recognize
that what's there now is a sort of informal markup; I'd either fix it up or
take it out.  So "*ad hoc*" or just "ad hoc".

(Or rephrase it, since this doesn't actually seem to be an appropriate use
of "ad hoc" but that's a separate issue :)

Better to just avoid the use of the backtick here.  I'd say "ioctl()s" but
that's me.  If nothing else, change it to a regular apostrophe.
