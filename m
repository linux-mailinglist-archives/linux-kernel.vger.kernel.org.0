Errm, no. We should not silently paper over it. If we detect that this came
in with a wrong stack frame, i.e. not from a CPU originated exception, then
we truly should yell loud. Also in that case you want to check the APIC:ISR
and issue an EOI to clear it.

How does it help? It still crashes the kernel.

No. We can map the APIC into the user space visible page tables for PTI
without compromising the PTI isolation and it can be read very early on
before SWAPGS. All you need is a register to clobber not more. It the ISR
is set, then go into an error path, yell loudly, issue EOI and return.
The only issue I can see is: It's slow :)
