Will do (v2->v3 was just a removal of stray Change-Id from the log messages=

At the moment, a bpf version is probably beyond my skills and goals,
but I hope the
following comments can clarify the difference in approach/performance:

-  my primary goal, implemented in patch 1/2, is to have this code embedded=
 in
  the kernel, _always available_ , even to users without the skills to
hack up the
  necessary bpf code, or load a bpf program (which may not be allowed in
  certain environments), and eventually replace and possibly improve custom
  variants of metric collections which we already have (or wished to,
but don't have
  because there wasn't a convenient library to use for them).

- I agree that this code can be recompiled in bpf (using a
  BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY for storage, and kstats_record() and
  ks_show_entry() should be easy to convert).

- the runtime cost and complexity of hooking bpf code is still a bit
unclear to me.
  kretprobe or tracepoints are expensive, I suppose that some lean hook
  replace register_kretprobe() may exist and the difference from inline
  annotations would be marginal (we'd still need to put in the hooks around
  the code we want to time, though, so it wouldn't be a pure bpf solution).
  Any pointers to this are welcome; Alexei mentioned fentry/fexit and
  bpf trampolines, but I haven't found an example that lets me do something
  equivalent to kretprobe (take a timestamp before and one after a function
  without explicit instrumentation)

- I still see some huge differences in usability, and this is in my opinion
  one very big difference between the two approaches. The systems where dat=
a
  collection may be of interest are not necessarily accessible to developer=
s
  with the skills to write custom bpf code, or load bpf modules
(security policies
  may prevent that). One thing is to tell a sysadmin to run
  "echo trace foo > /sys/kernel/debug/kstats/_config"
  or "watch grep CPUS /sys/kernel/debug/kstats/bar",
  another one is to tell them to load a bpf program (or write their own one=
).

thanks for the feedback
