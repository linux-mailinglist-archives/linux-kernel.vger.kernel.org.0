As for SystemTap, guru mode (an expert mode which disables protection provided
by SystemTap; allowing kernel to crash when something went wrong) could be used
for holding spinlock. However, as far as I know, holding mutex (or doing any
operation that might sleep) from such dynamic hooks is not allowed. Also we will
need to export various symbols in order to allow access from such dynamic hooks.

I'm not familiar with eBPF, but I guess that eBPF is similar.

But please be aware that, I REPEAT AGAIN, I don't think neither eBPF nor
SystemTap will be suitable for dumping OOM information. OOM situation means
that even single page fault event cannot complete, and temporary memory
allocation for reading from kernel or writing to files cannot complete.

Therefore, we will need to hold all information in kernel memory (without
allocating any memory when OOM event happened). Dynamic hooks could hold
a few lines of output, but not all lines we want. The only possible buffer
which is preallocated and large enough would be printk()'s buffer. Thus,
I believe that we will have to use printk() in order to dump OOM information.
At that point,

  static bool (*oom_handler)(struct oom_control *oc) = default_oom_killer;

  bool out_of_memory(struct oom_control *oc)
  {
          return oom_handler(oc);
  }

and let in-tree kernel modules override current OOM killer would be
the only practical choice (if we refuse adding many knobs).
