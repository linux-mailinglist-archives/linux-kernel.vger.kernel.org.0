I've already explained several times why this is not feasible.  It
would require DtbLoader to be familiar with each individual device,
and be rev'd every time a new device appears.  That is not practical
at all.

(And fwiw, the ACPI tables describe each panel.. with an ACPI method
that is passed the the panel-id and returns the appropriate table..
since DT doesn't have methods, this is the solution.)

I stand by this patch, we can't keep running away from this problem
and wave the magic firmware wand.
