For MDS vulnerable processors with TSX support, enabling either MDS or
TAA mitigations will enable the use of VERW to flush internal processor
buffers at the right code path. IOW, they are either both mitigated
or both not. However, if the command line options are inconsistent,
the vulnerabilites sysfs files may not report the mitigation status
correctly.

For example, with only the "mds=3Doff" option:

  vulnerabilities/mds:Vulnerable; SMT vulnerable
  vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort:Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT vulner=
able

The mds vulnerabilities file has wrong status in this case. Similarly,
the taa vulnerability file will be wrong with mds mitigation on, but
taa off.

Change taa_select_mitigation() to sync up the two mitigation status
and have them turned off if both "mds=3Doff" and "tsx_async_abort=3Doff"
are present.

Both hw-vuln/mds.rst and hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.rst are updated
to emphasize the fact that both "mds=3Doff" and "tsx_async_abort=3Doff"
have to be specified together for processors that are affected by both
TAA and MDS to be effective. As kernel-parameter.txt references both
documents above, it is not necessary to update it.
