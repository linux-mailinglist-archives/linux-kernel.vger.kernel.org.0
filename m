Right.  That's why the driver has to save and restore the srm when the
GPU is powered down.  I guess that part can be done by the host
processor as long as the srm is signed properly.

IIRC, the revoke stuff gets gleaned from the stream by the secure
processor somehow when you play back secure content.  I'm not entirely
clear on the details, but from the design, the driver doesn't have to
do anything in our case other than saving and restoring the srm from
the secure processor.
