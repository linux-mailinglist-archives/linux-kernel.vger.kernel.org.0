Sorry, what do you mean exactly for "this" here?  Call
madvise(,,MADV_FREE)?  Or migrate pages?

> If so, can you quantify the benefit at all?

The question is what is the right workload?  For example, I can build a
scenario as below to show benefit.

- run program A in node 0 with many lazily freed pages

- run program B in node 1, so that the free memory on node 1 is low

- migrate the program A from node 0 to node 1, so that the program B is
  influenced by the memory pressure created by migrating lazily freed
  pages.

Best Regards,
Huang, Ying
