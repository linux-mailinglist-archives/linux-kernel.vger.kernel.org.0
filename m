We may have talked in the past about how hugetlbfs locking is not ideal.
However, there are many things in hugetlbfs that are not ideal. :(  The
thought was to avoid making changes unless they showed up as real problems.
Looks like the locking is now a real issue.

I'll start work on restructuring at least this part of the locking.  But,
let's move forward with the deferred freeing approach until that is ready.
