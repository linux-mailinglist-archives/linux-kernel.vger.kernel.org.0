Yes, your patch is

Reported-and-tested-by: Lukas Wunner <lukas@wunner.de>

I'm withdrawing my own patch because further testing has shown that while it
fixes the non-blinking cursor issue, it doesn't flush scrollback if "\e[3J"
is written to the foreground console.

Would you prefer me to submit your patch with your Signed-off-by or rather
submit it yourself with my Tested-by?  If the latter, please include a code
comment explaining that ->con_switch() has the side effect of flushing
scrollback.  That seems quite non-obvious to me.

I see, thanks for the explanation.
