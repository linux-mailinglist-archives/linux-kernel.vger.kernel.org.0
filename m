It's simply math after finding a valid free page from the per-zone free 
area to use as fallback.  We find the beginning and end of the pageblock 
of the valid page and that can bring us into memory that was reserved per 
the e820.  pfn_valid() is still true (it's backed by a struct page), but 
since it's zero'd we shouldn't make any inferences here about comparing 
its node or zone.  The current node check just happens to succeed most of 
the time by luck because reserved memory typically appears on node 0.

The fix here is to validate that we actually have buddy pages before 
testing if there's any type of zone or node strangeness going on.

Does it?  The first is checking for a corrupted page_to_nid the second is 
checking for a corrupted or unexpected page_zone.  What's being tested 
here is the state of struct page, as it was previous to this patch, not 
the state of struct zone.
