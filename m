I doubt this is a significant issue, and there's already a global lock
taken once or twice in that path, the fix is purely to make sure that
the some locked section is used both for the lookup and the addition as
the bug comes from the window in between those two operations allowing
the object to be removed after it was "found".

Cheers,
Ben.
