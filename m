no worries, it may have seemed a daft question

In fact, I now consider what I was attempting to be a hack and not the 
proper solution to the problem.

So we assign an IOMMU group to a device in the really_probe() dma 
configure, which I required to be in order.

However the proper approach may now be to take the device iommu group 
assignment outside the device driver probe path, and not consider device 
links as the solution or any such device driver probe ordering.

No, just 2 PCI devices, the port and an end device.

Yes, I did try something like this, but, again, it just looks like the 
IOMMU group device assignment needs rework.

As above.

Please note that we still may want to use device links for ensuring 
probe ordering of the DMA device and the IOMMU, but this is not a 
specifically related issue.

Much appreciated,
