Uh, you don't have a permanent store on the chip? I thought another
requirement is that you can't downgrade.

And for hw solutions all you do with the updated revoke cert is stuff it
into the hw, it's purely for updating it. And those updates need to come
from somewhere else (usually in the media you play), the kernel can't
fetch them over the internet itself. I thought we already had the function
to give you the srm directly so you can stuff it into the hw, but looks
like that part isn't there (yet).
