I guess nobody else has hit this issue. The problem still occurs with 5.3.

I started a bisect and was able to determine that the problem is not
present in 5.2 but was introduced in a later 5.2.x stable update and
is present in 5.3. I will report my results when the bisect it
complete but it takes several hybrid-sleep/resume cycles to be sure
the issue does not exist in a given commit. If anyone else is
observing this problem or has any ideas, please let me know.

Thanks,
