Indeed!  I think we need this kind of abstraction for VLPI.

Yeah, this is exactly what I was having in the mind when reporting this
problem - "maybe we should have a SW emulated VINV+VSYNC for VLPI".
So I think this patch has done the right thing.

And what about the INT and CLEAR?  In response to guest's INT/CLEAR
commands, hypervisor (I mean KVM) will bother the ITS driver to send
INT/CLEAR for VLPIs.  They're both followed by SYNC and might need the
same fixes?


Thanks,
Zenghui
