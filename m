Subject: [PATCH 03/25] arm64: dts: allwinner: Switch H5 dts(i) to use SPDX identifier
Date:   Wed,  3 Jul 2019 18:15:47 +0530

Adopt the SPDX license identifier headers to ease license
compliance management on Allwinner H5 dts(i) files.

While the text specifies "of the GPL or the X11 license"
but the actual license text matches the MIT license as
specified at [0]
