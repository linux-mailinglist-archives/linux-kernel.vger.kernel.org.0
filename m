That is a good way of putting it. It's not the mental model I had of futex=
es,
but I can see how under that mental model a WAKE that doesn't wake an
overlapping futex is inconsistent. (my mental model was a memory compariso=
n
followed by a hashtable store. The WAKE has to pass the same hash key to
find anything)

The question of whether to pass a size to WAKE or not is not something I c=
are
about (as I said, my first version did pass a size to WAKE) so I will chan=
ge
my code to require a size in WAKE. I have my opinions about which one I pr=
efer
but if I can't convince you then that shouldn't hold back the change. But
a sized WAKE does open up a few questions:

1. It would be easy for me to verify that sizes match when the address tha=
t's
   passed in is the same address. Meaning a WAIT with 8 bits but a WAKE wi=
th
   16 bits on the same address would return -EINVAL. But it's harder to
   validate a similar mismatch on overlapping futexes. Meaning a 32 bit WA=
IT
   on @ptr and a 8 bit WAKE on @ptr+1 would just return 0.

   This might theoretically lead to problems if we ever want to have the
   semantics of MONITOR/MWAIT in the future, because I'm saying that that
   last mismatch does not wake anything and is not an error. This will mak=
e
   it hard to change the semantics in the future. Are we OK with that?

2. If we are OK with that, there are questions about what to do about weir=
d
   uses like a 8 bit WAIT and a 32 bit WAIT on the same address. An 8 bit
   WAKE on the same address should now probably just wake the 8 bit WAIT, =
but
   a second 8 bit WAKE would then return an error because there is a
   mismatching size. This is confusing so my first thought is to just disa=
llow
   all mixing of sizes, even among waiters. It seems unlikely that this wi=
ll
   ever be needed.

3. Implementing the full semantics of MONITOR/MWAIT would give obvious ans=
wers
   to both of these questions, and I think I could even do it without slow=
ing
   down futexes too much. (just use the address/4 as the hash key so that =
all
   potentially overlapping futexes hash to the same bucket) But it would a=
lso
   open up new questions. Like what happens if you call a 32 bit WAKE with
   val=3D1, meaning wake up one sleeper, but it overlaps with two 16 bit f=
utexes?
   Does it wake one sleeper in both of them? That would be consistent with
   MONITOR/MWAIT behavior, but it would contradict the current documentati=
on.
   (which might be OK because it would only do so for new behavior)


My current thinking for these is as follows, in reverse order:

3. I would not implement the full MONITOR/MWAIT behavior. It's not require=
d
for my use case, it would definitely add a small amount of overhead, and i=
t
bothers me that adjacent 8 bit futexes would hash to the same bucket. (at
least they would if I can't come up with another way of implementing it) A=
ll
I want is smaller mutexes and the behavior required by the C++ standard, s=
o I
don't need new semantics for that.

2. I will disallow all operations that pass a different size for the same
address. That includes disallowing an 8 bit WAIT followed by a 32 bit WAIT=
 on
the same address.

1. I will only verify that the size matches if the same address was passed=
.
Overlapping futexes are not detected and will not raise an error.

This will lead to an inconsistent implementation in the MONITOR/MWAIT ment=
al
model, but it leads to a consistent implementation in the comparison+hasht=
able
mental model. It will have the same behavior as my initial patch except th=
at
all operations will error out if a size mismatch is detected.

Please let me know if this is OK with you. I don't think that this gains u=
s
anything over having an unsized WAKE, but if this is what others want, I c=
an
write the code. If we instead want the full MONITOR/MWAIT semantics, I can
probably also make that happen with a very small slowdown compared to the
current code. I just need to know if that's what you want.

Thanks,

Malte
