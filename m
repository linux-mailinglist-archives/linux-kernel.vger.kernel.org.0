Hi,

Well not always, With CONFIG_SMP we modify only some of the SMP code on boot,
see arch/arm/kernel/head.S for smp_on_up and then the related macro usage.

The TI INTC is probably better documented in dm3630 trm, it's the same
controller but with a different revision.

Let's see what Thomas has to say for that. Meanwhile, please take a
look at Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst for getting things
right for sending out patches that can be applied without manual
editing :)

Cheers,

Tony
