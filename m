The race condition is between a gadget calling usb_ep_dequeue() and the 
driver completing the URB.

Lets say in a thread you have a reference to a in-flight URB and you 
want to abort the request, e.g. because the application that sent the 
request has been closed. But concurrently to that the URB is completed 
by the hardware and the interrupt fires and marks the URB as complete. 
Your thread is suspended while the interrupt is running, once the 
interrupt has finished the thread wakes up, still has the reference to 
the URB, but now it has been completed. The thread still calls 
usb_ep_dequeue() though and then undefined behavior occurs.

The context in which we observed the issue is when using function fs to 
create a userspace gadget and using aio_cancel() to abort a pending URB. 
But really any gadget that aborts a transfer before it is completed or 
before the timeout occurred can run into this issue.
