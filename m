Hi Ingo,

I re-read my previous reply, it's long and tedious, let me try to make
a more effective reply:

> What sizes are we talking about here?

The size here is how much memory will be reserved for kdump kernel, to
ensure kdump kernel and userspace can run without OOM.

>
> - What is the possible size range of swiotlb_size_or_default()

swiotlb_size_or_default() returns the swiotlb size, it's specified by
user using swiotlb=<size>, or default size (64MB)

>

It's 4G.

It's quite hard to "accurately sizing the area".

No way to tell the exact amount of memory kdump needs, we can only estimate.
Kdump kernel use different cmdline, drivers and components will have
special handling for kdump, and userspace is totally different.

My first attempt is increase crashkernel memory as swiotlb is
activated. There are problems.

First, SME/SEV is currently the only case that both kernel require
SWIOTLB, for most other case, it's wasting memory.

If we don't care about the memory waste, it has to check/reserve/free
crashkernel memory at three different points:
1. Early boot:
    - crash kernel reserved a region as usual.
2. Right before memblock freeing memoy:
    - If SWIOTLB is activated, crash kernel should reserve another region.
3. After Initcalls:
    - SWIOTLB may get deactivated by initcalls, so need to do a later
check for if we need to release the later reserved region.
It's more complex.

And about a "kdump_memory_reserve(size)" facility, as talked above,
it's hard to know how much kdump needs for now, also hard to find any
user of this.

Please let me know if I failed to make something clear or have any
misunderstanding.
