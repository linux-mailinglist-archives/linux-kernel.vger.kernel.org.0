I launched perf record with the default options. Here=E2=80=99s one of =
the perf_event_open calls from strace:

08:57:37.083733 perf_event_open({type=3DPERF_TYPE_HARDWARE, =
size=3DPERF_ATTR_SIZE_VER5, config=3DPERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES, =
sample_freq=3D4000, =
sample_type=3DPERF_SAMPLE_IP|PERF_SAMPLE_TID|PERF_SAMPLE_TIME|PERF_SAMPLE_=
PERIOD, read_format=3DPERF_FORMAT_ID, disabled=3D1, inherit=3D1, =
pinned=3D0, exclusive=3D0, exclusive_user=3D0, exclude_kernel=3D1, =
exclude_hv=3D0, exclude_idle=3D0, mmap=3D1, comm=3D1, freq=3D1, =
inherit_stat=3D0, enable_on_exec=3D1, task=3D1, watermark=3D0, =
precise_ip=3D3 /* must have 0 skid */, mmap_data=3D0, sample_id_all=3D1, =
exclude_host=3D0, exclude_guest=3D1, exclude_callchain_kernel=3D0, =
exclude_callchain_user=3D0, mmap2=3D1, comm_exec=3D1, use_clockid=3D0, =
context_switch=3D0, write_backward=3D0, namespaces=3D0, wakeup_events=3D0,=
 config1=3D0, config2=3D0, sample_regs_user=3D0, sample_regs_intr=3D0, =
aux_watermark=3D0, sample_max_stack=3D0}, 134206, 18, -1, =
PERF_FLAG_FD_CLOEXEC) =3D 23 <0.000023>

sample_freq is 4000 (and freq is 1). Here=E2=80=99s the man page on this =
field:

       sample_period, sample_freq
              A "sampling" event is one that generates an  overflow  =
notifica=E2=80=90
              tion  every N events, where N is given by sample_period.  =
A sam=E2=80=90
              pling event has sample_period > 0.   When  an  overflow  =
occurs,
              requested  data is recorded in the mmap buffer.  The =
sample_type
              field controls what data is recorded on each overflow.

              sample_freq can be used if you wish to use frequency =
rather than
              period.   In  this case, you set the freq flag.  The =
kernel will
              adjust the sampling period to try and achieve the desired  =
rate.
              The rate of adjustment is a timer tick.

If I=E2=80=99m reading this right, this is a sampling event which =
overflows 4000 times a second. But perf then does a poll call which =
wakes up on this FD with POLLIN after 1.637 seconds, instead of 0.00025 =
seconds.

The man page snippet you pasted seems to be a different definition of an =
overflow event, but that doesn=E2=80=99t make sense either: the event =
generates a sample 4000 times a second, and 0 (supposedly the same as 1) =
would mean to wake up the FD after 1 sample, which would be 0.00025 =
seconds.
