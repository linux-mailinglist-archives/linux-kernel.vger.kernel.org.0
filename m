Well, that's the point of the rcu_tasks. To let us know when a task has
voluntarily slept. I don't think we want to "fix" that.

The array is not the complex part of this. It was probably the easiest
part of this patch series. It just shows up a lot in the beginning
because I needed it to work before doing anything else. The more
difficult parts came with the passing of data from entry to exit.

I plan on keeping the array for now, as it is just an internal
implementation detail, that gives us only a limitation of the array
size that is noticed outside of the function graph code. If we find
some kind of RCU alternative, then we can switch to that in the
future and remove the array limitation.
