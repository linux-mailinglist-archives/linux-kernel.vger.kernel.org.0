yes because we want to even as much as possible the number of tasks per group

hmm but we don't want to prevent this active balance for migrate_task
because of cases like the one you mentioned above.

we might consider to finally select a CPU with only 1 running task
with migrate_util if there is no other CPU with more than 1 task. But
this would complexify the code and I don't think it's possible because
migrate_util is used to pull some utilizations from an overloaded
group which must have a CPU with a waiting task to be overloaded.
