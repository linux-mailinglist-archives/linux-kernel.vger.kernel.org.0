Hi everybody,

I was just curious if the patch

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10320195/

somehow got lost or was never upstreamed. I remember to have seen both fans in
my P50 a while ago (presumably pre 4.19 era) but was unsure if I patched it manually or if
the patch got lost upstream.

Would be glad to get a heads-up on anything relevant. Please CC: as I'm
currently not subscribed.

Thanks,
Marc
