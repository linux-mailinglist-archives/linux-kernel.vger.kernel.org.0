No, it shouldn’t break with "non-OSI-mode + 0 ACTIVE TCS"

After taking your suggestion to do rpmh start/end transaction in v13, rpmh_end_transaction()
invokes rpmh_flush() only for the last client and by this time expecting all of rpmh_write()
and rpmh_write_batch() will be already “finished” as client first waits for them to finish
and then only invokes end.

So driver is good to handle rpmh_write() and rpmh_write_batch() calls.

Regarding rpmh_write_async() call, which is a fire-n-forget request from SW and client driver
may immediately invoke rpmh_end_transaction() after this.

this case is also handled…
Lets again take an example for understanding this..

1.    Client invokes rpmh_write_async() to send ACTIVE cmds for targets which has zero ACTIVE TCS

    Rpmh driver Re-purposes one of SLEEP/WAKE TCS to use as ACTIVE, internally this also sets
    drv->tcs_in_use to true for respective SLEEP/WAKE TCS.

2.    Client now without waiting for above to finish, goes ahead and invokes rpmh_end_transaction()
    which calls rpmh_flush() (in case cache become dirty)

    Now if re-purposed TCS is still in use in HW (transaction in progress), we still have
    drv->tcs_in_use set. So the rpmh_rsc_invalidate() (invoked from rpmh_flush()) will keep on
    returning -EAGAIN until that TCS becomes free to use and then goes ahead to finish its job.
   
Thanks,
Maulik
