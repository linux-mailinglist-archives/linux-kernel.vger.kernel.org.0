And if instead you tested whether the actual feature you need works as
you need it to, it would even work fine if there was a bug we fixed that
breaks things for the kernel.  Without needing a new compiler.

Or as another example, if we added support for some other flags. (x86
has only a few flags; many other archs have many more, and in some cases
newer hardware actually has more flags than older).

With the "macro" scheme we would need to add new macros in all these
cases.  And since those are target-specific macros, that quickly expands
beyond reasonable bounds.

If you want to know if you can do X in some environment, just try to do X.
