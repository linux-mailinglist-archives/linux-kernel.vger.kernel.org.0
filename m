Sure, will add some comments to elaborate the return values.

Yes, the old code had putback_movable_pages called when !err. But, I 
think that is for error handling of mbind_range() if I understand it 
correctly since if queue_pages_range() returns -EIO (only MPOL_MF_STRICT 
was specified and there was misplaced page) that page list should be 
empty . The old code should checked whether that list is empty or not.

So, in the new code I just removed that.

Yes, the goto does eliminate the extra indentation.

Really? The old code doesn't have '{ }' for else, and checkpatch doesn't 
report any error or warning.
