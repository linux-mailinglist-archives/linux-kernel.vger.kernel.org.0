Historically the kernel documentation build was a Rube Goldberg machine,
and if you were lucky, you reached the end. There were failure points
all over the place. There were "impedance mismatches" in the inputs and
outputs at various stages. There were *insane* escaping issues to get
some text passed through as intended.

At the high level, we've reduced that to *two*, Sphinx and kernel-doc
the perl script, we've made kernel-doc emit rst instead of xml/html, and
we even run the script from within a Sphinx extension to get the error
reporting and dependency management right.

Being able to throw away a lot of conversion and interpretation from
kernel-doc was a goal, passing through the kernel-doc comments unchanged
as much as possible was a feature. This was really the key to making it
possible to document the kernel with Sphinx to begin with.

I think it's a mistake to add anything to kernel-doc that isn't trying
to streamline that process even more. Minimize what kernel-doc does as
much as possible (but not more).

The moment you start adding "a few compact idioms", you start
introducing more ways to trip over the mismatch between kernel-doc
syntax and rst. And you end up trying to figure out ways to escape stuff
in one or the other.


BR,
Jani.


PS. The kernel was always going to be held back by insane amounts of
existing kernel-doc comments, as well as aversion to adding build
dependencies. My vision of what a minimalistic Sphinx based C code
documentation system free of those ties might look like is Hawkmoth [1].
