Hi Nick, this is on our schedule in a new 2-3 weeks, sorry not to update
your in another mail loop earlier.

What I plan to do is to cc you for the clang reports when 0-day ci sends
to kernel patch author. If you notice something may be related to clang (since
we always integrate newer clang version), you can help filter it out. How
do you think?
