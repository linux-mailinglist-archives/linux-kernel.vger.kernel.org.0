Yes, I would like to keep the WARN_ON_ONCE just because you never know.

Of course it would be much better to audit the calls to kvm_write_guest
and figure out how many could trigger (e.g. two from the operands of an
emulated instruction, 5 from a nested EPT walk, 1 from a page walk, etc.).

Which ioctls?  Most ioctls shouldn't dirty memory at all.

Good point, the race would become

 	vCPU 1			vCPU 2		host
 	---------------------------------------------------------------
 	mark page dirty
 				write to page
						reset rings
						  wait for mmu lock
 	add page to ring
	release mmu lock
						  ...do reset...
						  release mmu lock
						page is now dirty

I don't think that's possible, most writes won't come from a page fault
path and cannot retry.
