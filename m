IIUC this patch is essentially a band-aid to get back to the scalability that was possible before persistent grant support was added. Ultimately the right answer should be to get rid of persistent grants support and use grant copy, but such a change is clearly more invasive and would need far more testing.

Good point.  I was also concerned about the performance fairness at first, but
settled in this ugly but simple solution mainly because my worst-case
performance test (detailed in 1st patch's commit msg) shows no visible
performance degradation, though it is a minimal test on my test environment.

Anyway, I agree with your future direction.

Appreciate this kind and detailed advice.  I will post the second version
applying your comments, soon.
