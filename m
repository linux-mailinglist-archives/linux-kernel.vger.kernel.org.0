This is something for Jens to comment on. Not waiting up on congestion
indeed sounds like a bug.

Yes this is true but you should realize that this path is triggered only
under heavy memory reclaim cases where there is nothing to reclaim
because there are too many pages already isolated and we are waiting for
reclaimers to make some progress on them. It is also possible that there
are simply no reclaimable pages at all and we are heading the OOM
situation. In both cases waiting a bit shouldn't be critical because
this is really a cold path. It would be much better to have a mechanism
to wake up earlier but this is likely to be non trivial and I am not
sure worth the effort considering how rare this should be.
