Yah, situation sounds familiar. :)

Can I see an actual example of what you're doing?

Makes sense.

Ok, here's my boot command line:

[    0.000000] Command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-5.5.0-rc7+ root=/dev/nvme0n1p2 ro root=/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.0025385481b2fe2a-part2 resume=/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.0025385481b2fe2a-part1 debug ignore_loglevel log_buf_len=16M no_console_suspend net.ifnames=0 mem_encrypt=off systemd.log_target=null

How do I use the bootconfig thing with it? Or is it not supposed to be
used that way? IOW, how is it supposed to be used so that it needs to be
enabled on every box?

Ok, this is getting closer. But not everyone is using boottime tracing?

Or is the logic: every user/tool might need to be able to do boottime
tracing at some future point in time and bootconfig is a mandatory part
of that use case?

Thx.
