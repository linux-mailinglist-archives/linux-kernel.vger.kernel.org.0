Hi, I think it's reasonable to update the patch to include the
NV_STORAGE regions as well, most likely the firmware only provided
NV_STORAGE region? Can you help confirm if the e820 didn't contain
ACPI data, and only ACPI NVS?

I had a try with this update patch, it worked and didn't break anything.

Hi Boris, would you prefer to just fold Junichi update patch into the
previous one or I should send an updated patch?
