OK, I guess that resolves my thoughts about "boot" reservations .vs 
"relaxable" ones - clearly they are distinct things, we will ultimately 
want both, and only the former can be hidden from userspace (and ignored 
by VFIO). I'm happy with that; we can come back to boot regions at a 
later date :)
