We can't say what the compiler contents will be. An architecture may use
this callback if it's using mcount, mfentry, patchable-function-entry,
or some other mechanism we're not aware of today. Depending on the
architecture and mechanism, the callsite could contain a number of
distinct things.

All the comment is trying to say is that when ftrace_init_nop() is
called, the callsite has not been modified in any way since being
compiled, so we can expect the contents to be whatever the compiler
generated.

Thanks,
Mark.
