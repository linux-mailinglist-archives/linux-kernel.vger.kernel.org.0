Dear SFConservancy. You might not understand the lawyer-speak, being 
headed for the longest time by a mere techie (ie: one who thinks arrays 
are a "necessary language tool"), but Free licenses are Revocable from 
free-takers.

Keep attacking the men who created the software and the men will 
eventually move to revoke your gratis licenses of their copyrighted 
works and burn the legal framework of Free Software to the ground (a 
framework that relies mostly on ignorance of the vagaries of copyright 
and licensing law).

Look, Free Software world, I told you a decade ago NOT to invite random 
women and non-techies into your world: you will gain nothing and they 
will set themselves up as gate keepers to your community.

They have done so. They just kicked out RMS from his own foundation. Who 
knows what "GPLv4" will contain now.
(Not that it matters: you can still revoke free licenses from 
free-takers regardless of what "terms" were "agreed upon" (no 
consideration on the part of the taker means no contractual rights to 
hold the distributee to))
RMS said absolutely nothing wrong: just things White Women and their 
golem-like white "men" find offensive.

(YHWH allows child brides, including in cases of rape (taphas): Devarim 
chapter 22, verse 28 (Hebrew Masoretic Text: Na'ar (child), Greek 
Septuagint: Padia (child, root word for paedophile), Latin Vulgate: 
Puella)

It's time to move Free Software and OpenSource out of America. America 
is the global enemy of all men anyway: why deal with the savages that 
slaughter countless innocents in the near-east because "they marry young 
girls, BETTER A MILLSTONE!" etc? Why associate yourself with such evil 
torturers and murderers that are the Proud American (White) Man (and his 
female Masters)?
