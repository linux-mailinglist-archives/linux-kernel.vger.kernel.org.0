The warnings and pitfalls are much appreciated. Also, this whole
discussion has been referenced in the recently started communication
thread with Renesas, to raise the awareness of what looks to be not
only the limitation of Renesas BSP, but the mainline kernel in the
first place.

Confirmed. Below two lines do the job (v5.4.13-rt7+).

This has been relayed to Renesas. Thanks.
