Please move the vX annoations below the --- marker so they are stripped out
automatically and I don't have to do it manually. They are not part of the
final changelog.

The x86 documentation got converted to RST recently. Also as this is a
64bit specific documentation it belongs into Documentation/x86/x86_64 and
not into the generic x86 directory.

Moving this into the 64 bit specific folder spares all the 'oh this is

That sentence does not make any sense. What has this to do with global

What means: declared using thread? I assume you meant declared with the
__thread storage class specifier. If so, why not using the proper technical

I don't see a tradition here and 'could' is just wrong.

So why is it even mentioned when it's not longer existing?

User space threading libraries are one particular use case and not really
interesting for documenting this functionality. Documentation is about the
concepts and not about what a particular usecase prefers.

I don't see the value of this either.

.....

This is completely unstructured information hastily cobbled together.

As time is pressing for the 5.3 merge window, I reworked the documentation
as below. Please review and comment ASAP so I can merge the whole lot.

+
+Using FS and GS segments in user space applications
+===================================================
+
+The x86 architecture supports segmentation. Instructions which access
+memory can use segment register based addressing mode. The following
+notation is used to address a byte within a segment:
+
+  Segment-register:Byte-address
+
+The segment base address is added to the Byte-address to compute the
+resulting virtual address which is accessed. This allows to access multiple
+instances of data with the identical Byte-address, i.e. the same code. The
+selection of a particular instance is purely based on the base-address in
+the segment register.
+
+In 32-bit mode the CPU provides 6 segments, which also support segment
+limits. The limits can be used to enforce address space protections.
+
+In 64-bit mode the CS/SS/DS/ES segments are ignored and the base address is
+always 0 to provide a full 64bit address space. The FS and GS segments are
+still functional in 64-bit mode.
+
+Common FS and GS usage
+------------------------------
+
+The FS segment is commonly used to address Thread Local Storage (TLS). FS
+is usually managed by runtime code or a threading library. Variables
+declared with the '__thread' storage class specifier are instantiated per
+thread and the compiler emits the FS: address prefix for accesses to these
+variables. Each thread has its own FS base address so common code can be
+used without complex address offset calculations to access the per thread
+instances. Applications should not use FS for other purposes when they use
+runtimes or threading libraries which manage the per thread FS.
+
+The GS segment has no common use and can be used freely by
+applications. There is no storage class specifier similar to __thread which
+would cause the compiler to use GS based addressing modes. Newer versions
+of GCC and Clang support GS based addressing via address space identifiers.
+
+
+Reading and writing the FS/GS base address
+------------------------------------------
+
+There exist two mechanisms to read and write the FS/FS base address:
+
+ - the arch_prctl() system call
+
+ - the FSGSBASE instruction family
+
+Accessing FS/GS base with arch_prctl()
+--------------------------------------
+
+ The arch_prctl(2) based mechanism is available on all 64bit CPUs and all
+ kernel versions.
+
+ Reading the base:
+
+   arch_prctl(ARCH_GET_FS, &fsbase);
+   arch_prctl(ARCH_GET_GS, &gsbase);
+
+ Writing the base:
+
+   arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_FS, fsbase);
+   arch_prctl(ARCH_SET_GS, gsbase);
+
+ The ARCH_SET_GS prctl may be disabled depending on kernel configuration
+ and security settings.
+
+Accessing FS/GS base with the FSGSBASE instructions
+---------------------------------------------------
+
+ With the Ivy Bridge CPU generation Intel introduced a new set of
+ instructions to access the FS and GS base registers directly from user
+ space. These instructions are also supported on AMD Family 17H CPUs. The
+ following instructions are available:
+
+  =============== ===========================
+  RDFSBASE %reg   Read the FS base register
+  RDGSBASE %reg   Read the GS base register
+  WRFSBASE %reg   Write the FS base register
+  WRGSBASE %reg   Write the GS base register
+  =============== ===========================
+
+ The instructions avoid the overhead of the arch_prctl() syscall and allow
+ more flexible usage of the FS/GS addressing modes in user space
+ applications. This does not prevent conflicts between threading libraries
+ and runtimes which utilize FS and applications which want to use it for
+ their own purpose.
+
+FSGSBASE instructions enablement
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ The instructions are enumerated in CPUID leaf 7, bit 0 of EBX. If
+ available /proc/cpuinfo shows 'fsgsbase' in the flag entry of the CPUs.
+
+ The availability of the instructions is not enabling them
+ automatically. The kernel has to enable them explicitely in CR4. The
+ reason for this is that older kernels make assumptions about the values in
+ the GS register and enforce them when GS base is set via
+ arch_prctl(). Allowing user space to write arbitrary values to GS base
+ would violate these assumptions and cause malfunction.
+
+ On kernels which do not enable FSGSBASE the execution of the FSGSBASE
+ instructions will fault with a #UD exception.
+
+ The kernel provides reliable information about the enabled state in the
+ ELF AUX vector. If the HWCAP2_FSGSBASE bit is set in the AUX vector, the
+ kernel has FSGSBASE instructions enabled and applications can use them.
+ The following code example shows how this detection works::
+
+   #include <sys/auxv.h>
+   #include <elf.h>
+
+   /* Will be eventually in asm/hwcap.h */
+   #ifndef HWCAP2_FSGSBASE
+   #define HWCAP2_FSGSBASE        (1 << 1)
+   #endif
+
+   ....
+
+   unsigned val = getauxval(AT_HWCAP2);
+
+   if (val & HWCAP2_FSGSBASE)
+        printf("FSGSBASE enabled\n");
+
+FSGSBASE instructions compiler support
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+GCC version 6 and newer provide instrinsics for the FSGSBASE
+instructions. Clang supports them as well.
+
+  =================== ===========================
+  _readfsbase_u64()   Read the FS base register
+  _readfsbase_u64()   Read the GS base register
+  _writefsbase_u64()  Write the FS base register
+  _writegsbase_u64()  Write the GS base register
+  =================== ===========================
+
+To utilize these instrinsics <immintrin.h> must be included in the source
+code and the compiler option -mfsgsbase has to be added.
+
+Compiler support for FS/GS based addressing
+-------------------------------------------
+
+GCC version 6 and newer provide support for FS/GS based addressing via
+Named Address Spaces. GCC implements the following address space
+identifiers for x86:
+
+  ========= ====================================
+  __seg_fs  Variable is addressed relative to FS
+  __seg_gs  Variable is addressed relative to GS
+  ========= ====================================
+
+The preprocessor symbols __SEG_FS and __SEG_GS are defined when these
+address spaces are supported. Code which implements fallback modes should
+check whether these symbols are defined. Usage example::
+
+  #ifdef __SEG_GS
+
+  long data0 = 0;
+  long data1 = 1;
+
+  long __seg_gs *ptr;
+
+  /* Check whether FSGSBASE is enabled by the kernel (HWCAP2_FSGSBASE) */
+  ....
+
+  /* Set GS to point to data0 */
+  _writegsbase_u64(&data0);
+
+  /* Access offset 0 of GS */
+  ptr = 0;
+  print("data0 = %ld\n", *ptr);
+
+  /* Set GS to point to data1 */
+  _writegsbase_u64(&data1);
+  /* ptr still addresses offset 0! */
+  print("data1 = %ld\n", *ptr);
+
+
+Clang does not provide these address space identifiers, but it provides
+an attribute based mechanism:
+
+ ==================================== =====================================
+  __attribute__((address_space(256))  Variable is addressed relative to GS
+  __attribute__((address_space(257))  Variable is addressed relative to FS
+ ==================================== =====================================
+
+FS/GS based addressing with inline assembly
+-------------------------------------------
+
+In case the compiler does not support address spaces, inline assembly can
+be used for FS/GS based addressing mode::
+
+	mov %fs:offset, %reg
+	mov %gs:offset, %reg
+
+	mov %reg, %fs:offset
+	mov %reg, %gs:offset
