Indeed, we are looking at different datasheets. It turns out that
'B101EAN01' is an underspecification, minnie uses the 'B101EAN01.8'
(eDP interface), your datasheet describes the 'B101EAN01.1' (LVDS
interface).

> Matthias, are you reverting this to solve any problem?

With the patch there is a user perceptible delay between switching on
the LCD and the backlight. Not necessarily a big problem, but better
avoid it if the delay is not needed.

to be down currently).

Thanks
