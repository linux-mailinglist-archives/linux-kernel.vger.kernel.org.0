1) you cannot go to slowpath for all such packets (route)
2) you might be interested to examine packets with other dest mac too.

Again, you are merging 2 things together:
1) rx filter - this is needed for bridge, ovs, others (tc)
	this is promisc setting
2) cpu trap - here one may be interested in:
     a) only packets ASIC traps to CPU by default (ARPs, STP, BGP, etc)
     b) all packets ingressing the port (note that those are only those
					 passed by rx filter)

Clearly 1) and 2) need separate knobs. In 2), there are valid usecases
for both a) and b). Only the user is the one who can tell which is he
interested in. This can't happen automagically.
Can we just have a knob for 2)?
