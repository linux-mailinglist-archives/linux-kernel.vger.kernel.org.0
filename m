Well, BUG_ON is about the worst way to handle an incorrect input. You
really do not want to put a production environment down just because
there is a bug in a driver, right? There are still many {VM_}BUG_ONs
in the tree and there is a general trend to get rid of many of them
rather than adding new ones.

Now back to your patch. You are adding an error handling where we simply
do not expect invalid data. This is often the case for the core kernel
functionality because we do expect consumers of the code to do the right
thing. E.g. __section_nr already takes a pointer to struct section which
assumes that this core data structure is already valid. Adding a check
here adds an unnecessary overhead so this doesn't really sound like a
good idea to me.
