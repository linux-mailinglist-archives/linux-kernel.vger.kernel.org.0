Subject: [PATCH 0/9] drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Improve support for AUO B116XAK01 + other low res DP
Date:   Fri, 13 Dec 2019 15:45:21 -0800

This series contains a pile of patches that was created to support
hooking up the AUO B116XAK01 panel to the eDP side of the bridge.  In
general it should be useful for hooking up a wider variety of DP
panels to the bridge, especially those with lower resolution and lower
bits per pixel.

The overall result of this series:
* Allows panels with fewer than 4 DP lanes hooked up to work.
* Optimizes the link rate for panels with 6 bpp.
* Supports trying more than one link rate when training if the main
  link rate didn't work.

It's not expected that this series will break any existing users, but
it is possible that the patch to skip non-standard DP rates could mean
that a panel that used to use one of these non-standard link rates
will now run at a higher rate than it used to.  If this happens, the
patch could be reverted or someone could figure out how to decide when
it's OK to use the non-standard rates.

To support the AUO B116XAK01, we could actually stop at the ("Use
18-bit DP if we can") patch since that causes the panel to run at a
link rate of 1.62 which works.  The patches to try more than one link
rate were all developed prior to realizing that I could just use
18-bit mode and were validated with that patch reverted.

The patch to try more than one rate was validated by forcing the code
to try 2.16 GHz (but still skip 2.43 GHz, which trains but shows
garbage on AUO B116XAK01) and seeing that we'd try 2.16 GHz (and fail)
and then eventually pass at 2.7 GHz and show a pretty screen.

These patches were tested on sdm845-cheza atop mainline as of
2019-12-13 and also on another board (the one with AUO B116XAK01) atop
a downstream kernel tree.

This patch series doesn't do anything to optimize the MIPI link and
only focuses on the DP link.  For instance, it's left as an exercise
to the reader to see if we can use the 666-packed mode on the MIPI
link and save some power (because we could lower the clock rate).

I am nowhere near a display expert and my knowledge of DP and MIPI is
pretty much zero.  If something about this patch series smells wrong,
it probably is.  Please let know and I'll try to fix it.
