So in this use-case, someone has configured a pair of chained counters
but only enabled the lower half. In this case we only create a 32bit backing
event (no PERF_ATTR_CFG1_KVM_PMU_CHAINED flag) - I guess this means the
perf event will trigger on 64bit period(?) despite the high counter being
disabled. The guest will see an interrupt in their disabled high counter.

This is a know limitation - see the comment "For
chained counters we only support overflow interrupts on the high counter"

Though upon looking at this it seems a little more broken. I guess where
both counters are enabled we want to overflow at 64bits and raise the
overflow to the high counter. When the high counter is disabled we want to
overflow on 32bits and raise the overflow to the low counter.

Perhaps something like the following would help:

It's not clear to me what is supposed to happen with overflow handling on the
low counter on chained counters (where the high counter is disabled).

That would suggest we create and destroy them each time the guest enables
and disables the counters - I would expect them to do that a lot (every
context switch) - my assumption would be that the current approach has
less overhead for a running guest.

Are they? Many of the calls into this file come from
arch/arm64/kvm/sys_regs.c where we apply a mask (value from
kvm_pmu_valid_counter_mask) to ignore unsupported counters.
