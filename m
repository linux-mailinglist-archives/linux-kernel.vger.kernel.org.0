While we're at it, I'd avoid the use of "mode" here since that has a
different meaning in the architecture, although I see we already use that
terminology for CPU_BIG_ENDIAN. How about:

  "Select the endianness of data accesses performed by the CPU. Userspace
   applications will need to be compiled and linked for the endianness
   that is selected here.

   Little-endian is compatible with x86, but big-endian is faster."

(ok, maybe drop that last sentence ;)

Then this can be:

  "Say Y if you plan on running a kernel with a big-endian userspace."

  "Say Y if you plan on running a kernel with a little-endian userspace.
   This is usually the case for distributions targetting arm64."

I think it's userspace that people really care about, so wording it in
terms of that makes most sense to me.
