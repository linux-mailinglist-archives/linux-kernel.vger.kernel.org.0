Subject: [PATCH] Ext4 Docs: Add missing bigalloc documentation.
Message-ID: <20190831154419.GA30357@fa19-cs241-404.cs.illinois.edu>
MIME-Version: 1.0

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There was a broken link for bigalloc. The page
https://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Bigalloc was not migrated into
the current documentation sources. This patch adds the contents of that
missing page into the section for Bigalloc itself.

Please note that I have not included changes from the "Kernel Support"
and "E2fsprogs Support" sections of the original page because the
comments there seemed outdated.

+bigalloc feature provides exactly this ability.

+The bigalloc feature (EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_BIGALLOC) changes ext4 to
+use clustered allocation, so that each bit in the ext4 block allocation
+bitmap addresses a power of two number of blocks. For example, if the
+file system is mainly going to be storing large files in the 4-32
+megabyte range, it might make sense to set a cluster size of 1 megabyte.
+This means that each bit in the block allocation bitmap now addresses
+256 4k blocks. This shrinks the total size of the block allocation
+bitmaps for a 2T file system from 64 megabytes to 256 kilobytes. It also
+means that a block group addresses 32 gigabytes instead of 128 megabytes,
+also shrinking the amount of file system overhead for metadata.
