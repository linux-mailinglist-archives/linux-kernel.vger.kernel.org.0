I would think the core can detect this condition. There's nothing
device specific once you have the dependency tree. You still need to
know what device needs to probe first and the drivers are going to
have that knowledge anyways. So wouldn't it be enough to allow probe
to proceed for devices in the loop. Once 1 driver succeeds, then you
can enforce the dependencies on the rest.

Seems like only ignoring the dependencies with a cycle would be
sufficient. For example, consider a clock controller which has 2 clock
inputs from other clock controllers where one has a cycle and one
doesn't. Also consider it has a regulator dependency. We only need to
ignore the dependency for 1 of the clock inputs. The rest of the
dependencies should be honored.

To do the above, it needs to be inverted.

Convince me that cycles are really a problem anywhere besides clocks.
I'd be more comfortable with a clock specific property if we only need
it for clocks and I'm having a hard time imagining cycles for other
dependencies.
