Hello Dear,

Greetings, to you. I have come across your name and contact as search
the mail for a very good partner.

Briefly I will explain a business to you and if it would be to your
interest, then we can move ahead to effectively build this business
relationship.

I have inherited the sum of $9.7 million dollars from my late father.
The funds had been with a bank here in my country.

As a result of some agreement clause, they could not release the funds
to me here locally.

In one occasion I went to the bank, a director of the bank called me
and explained to me that even if I want to transfer the funds out to
the account of a foreign partner, that it would take much time,
lawyers and many expenses.
He explained to me that the rigors are so much and most foreign
partners might not be interested to involve in such expenditure
because of the fear of scam.

He advised me that, I can get a foreign partner but instead of
transferring the funds to the account of the foreign partner, the bank
will offer an ATM card to my partner.

The ATM card is a PREMIUM PLATINUM CARD and this would allow us to
make withdrawals of the fund in your country to the tune of
50,000-100,000 dollars per day.

He explained to me that the card is good and would be sent to the
contact of my foreign partner by DHL or FEDEX.

If you are interested to partner with me, please reach back to me for
details and we can also discuss my investment plans.

Kind Regards,
Miss.Fatima Yusuf
