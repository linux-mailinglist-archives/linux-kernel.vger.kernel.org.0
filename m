Yes, that will be a deadlock even with the my rwsem patch applied, as it
will still try to preserve the reader-writer ordering. So it will
certainly be safer to have the same lock ordering for both tasks.

With my patchset applied, the reader-writer ordering is still supposed
to be preserved. Of course, there can be exceptions depending on the
exact timing, but we can't rely on that to prevent deadlock.
