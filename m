Sure, but that should be irrelevant since the effective problem here is 
in the sync_*_for_cpu direction, and it's the unmap which nobbles the 
buffer. If the driver does this:

	dma_map_single(whole buffer);
	<device writes to part of buffer>
	dma_unmap_single(whole buffer);
	<contents of rest of buffer now undefined>

then it could instead do this and be happy:

	dma_map_single(whole buffer, SKIP_CPU_SYNC);
	<device writes to part of buffer>
	dma_sync_single_for_cpu(updated part of buffer);
	dma_unmap_single(whole buffer, SKIP_CPU_SYNC);
	<contents of rest of buffer still valid>

Robin.
