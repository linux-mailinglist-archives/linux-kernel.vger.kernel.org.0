What was the time to read the sensors before you did the change?
It depends a lot on the system, so I can't really guess.

I'm pretty sure we didn't try that in the original work, but I'm
not sure that would work.  Most of the initial spinning would be
pointless.

I would guess that you would decrease the delay and the performance
would improve linearly until you hit a certain point, and then
decreasing the delay wouldn't make a big difference.  That's the
point you want to use, I think.

What might actually be best would be for the driver to measure the
time it takes the BMC to respond and try to set the timeout based
on that information.  BMCs vary a lot, a constant probably won't
work.

And I was just saying that I wasn't expecting any big changes in
the IPMI driver any more...

Unfortunately not.  The original people at Dell that did the work
don't work there any more, I don't think.

I mostly use qemu now for testing, but this is not something you can
really simulate on qemu very well.  Can you do an IPMI firmware
update on your system?  That would be the easiest way to measure.
