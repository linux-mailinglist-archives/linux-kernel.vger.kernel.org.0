It is very easy to reproduce if you check `lsmod` output for your graphics driver. I checked it on `i915` and `amdgpu`: when graphics session is opened you can't remove it and `lsmod` doesn't show who's using it.

Hmm, we technically have mod->source_list and mod->target_list
already, which keeps track of modules that depend on THIS_MODULE and
modules that THIS_MODULE depends on, respectively. However, this is
limited to symbol dependencies only, which is what is shown in lsmod
in the Used By field. In other words, we currently only keep track of
module dependencies when a module uses a symbol from another module.

Indeed, it could be nice to keep track of try_module_get() callers,
but I'm afraid this is not as trivial as simply adding owner to
mod->source_list when try_module_get() is called. try_module_get() and
module_put() are designed to be quick and callable from interrupt and
process context, and mod->{source,target}_list are protected by the
module_mutex. Even if we could use module_mutex, it may increase lock
contention considerably. So the locking scheme would have to be
reworked to make this happen. I suppose this could be introduced as a
DEBUG option, and I'd welcome a patch if there's someone out there
interested in picking up the legwork. But I don't get the feeling
that the demand for this is that high (perhaps I'm totally wrong?),
especially for something that ftrace could report on much better. I
could for example trace all module_get's and put's from boot and see
which processes and even the call sites where these calls stem from.
E.g., if I enable tracing in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/module/module_{get,put}
(and filter name == "i915"), you'd see output like:

               X-2404  [000] ....  2334.643888: module_put: i915 call_site=dma_buf_release refcnt=33
               X-2404  [000] ....  2334.643990: module_put: i915 call_site=dma_buf_release refcnt=32
        kwin_x11-2877  [007] ....  2334.645605: module_get: i915 call_site=dma_buf_export refcnt=33
        kwin_x11-2877  [007] ....  2334.650827: module_get: i915 call_site=dma_buf_export refcnt=34

Of course, you'd have to know to enable tracing before the problem
occurs..

Hope that helps clarify things a bit,

Jessica
