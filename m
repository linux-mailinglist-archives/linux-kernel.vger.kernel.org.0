I agree with you.

We are not using mainline kernel for product, but LTS 4.4 is working
fine, and also we tested LTS 4.19 kernel without any other big-endian
patches, the latest big-endian bug we found is this:

a6002ec5a8c6 arm64: opcodes.h: Add arm big-endian config options before including arm header

The running kernel code covered but Huawei's telecommunication products
is limited, but I think ARM64 arch code is working fine for big-endian.

Thanks
Hanjun
