Huh, interestingly I think this comes from the combination of the two problems you point out, which evolved separately:
Earlier we had no exported interface between the transport driver and the mailbox client, just a void pointer. So using "long" in the structure would not work, because it would behave differently between arm32 and arm64 kernels. But the firmware interface would always be fixed to one of the two calling conventions, regardless of the kernel "bitness", as advertised by the upper bits of the function ID.
So we introduced explicit types that are used depending on the firmware-advertised calling convention. The idea was that any packed data any client would provide would always end up in consecutive registers in the firmware.
Now we explicitly advertise the expected message structure in the new header file, so we could go back to unsigned long here, indeed. A 32-bit kernel could never use the 64-bit calling convention, so long would fit. In a 64-bit kernel the compiler would either downgrade the long argument to the 32-bit arguments the firmware expects, or keep it long.
So it might be worth a short to go back to long.

I wouldn't call it a "library", but indeed we expose the transport protocol to the mailbox client. It seems that the mailbox framework is not really clear here, it just states that (at least in many cases) the mailbox client knows about the transport protocol, even though the separation between the two suggests otherwise. This probably stems back from the days, where mailboxes were directly used by their users, without providing any kind of abstraction.
So going with this, the SMC mailbox transport driver enforces a specific transport protocol for the payload, namely the six SMCCC defined registers. So we make this available, so any mailbox client knows what to expect. At the end of the day on the other end there will be some firmware probably expecting specific data in specific registers - or no data at all, as in the simple doorbell case we intend to use for SCPI/SCMI.

If you want to use the mailbox just as a doorbell (as in our case), it doesn't matter, so we can as well expose the underlying transport protocol.

Cheers,
Andre.
