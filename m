The PMR case really ought to have have a cc clobber, because who knows 
what this may end up inlined into, and compilers can get pretty 
aggressive with instruction scheduling in ways which leave a live value 
in CPSR across sizeable chunks of other code. It's true that the non-PMR 
case doesn't need it, but the surrounding code still needs to be 
generated to accommodate both possible versions of the alternative. From 
the look of the rest of the patch, the existing pseudo-NMI code has this 
bug in a few places.

Technically you could omit it when ARM64_PSEUDO_NMI is configured out 
entirely, but at that point you may as well omit the whole alternative 
as well. It's probably not worth the bother unless it proves to have a 
significant impact on codegen overall. On which note the memory clobber 
also seems superfluous either way :/

That said, now that I've been looking at it for this long, if the aim is 
just to create a zero/nonzero value then couldn't the PMR case just be 
"eor %w0, %w1, #GIC_PRIO_IRQON" and avoid the need for clobbers at all?

Robin.
