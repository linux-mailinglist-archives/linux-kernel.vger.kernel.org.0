Ooh, a topic that reasonable people can disagree on!

The current prototype I have will allocate (huge) pages and then
ask the filesystem to fill them.  The filesystem may well find that
the extent is a hole, and if it is, it will fill the page with zeroes.
Then, the application may write to those pages, and if it does, the
filesystem will be notified to create an on-disk extent for that write.

I haven't looked at the hole-punch path in detail, but presumably it
notifies the filesystem to create a hole extent and zeroes out the
pagecache for that range (possibly by removing entire pages, and with
memset for partial pages).  Then a subsequent write to the hole will
cause the filesystem to allocate a new non-hole extent, just like the
previous case.

I think it's reasonable for the page cache to interpret a hole-punch
request as being a hint that the hole is unlikely to be accessed again,
so allocating new smaller pages for that region of the file (or just
writing back & dropping the covering page altogether) would seem like
a reasonable implementation decision.

However, it also seems reasonable that just memset() of the affected
region and leaving the page intact would also be an acceptable
implementation.  As long as writes to the newly-created hole cause the
page to become dirtied and thus writeback to be in effect.  It probably
wouldn't be as good an implementation, but it shouldn't lose writes as
you suggest above.

I'm not sure I'd choose to split a large page into smaller pages.  I think
I'd prefer to allocate lower-order pages and memcpy() the data over.
Again, that's an implementation choice, and not something that should
be visible outside the implementation.
