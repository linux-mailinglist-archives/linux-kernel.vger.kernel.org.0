Oh, OK, I think I now got the question (sorry :-).

So, (exclusive) cpusets define "isolated" domains of CPUs among which
DEADLINE tasks can freely migrate following the global EDF rule:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/scheduler/sched-deadline.rst#L413

Relaxing this constraint and allowing users to define per-task
affinities (via setaffinity) can lead to situations where affinity masks
of different tasks overlap, and this creates problem for the admission
control checks that are currently implemented.

Theory has been developed already that tackles the problem of
overlapping affinities, but that is not yet implemented (it adds
complexity that would have to be supported by strong usecases).

Best,

Juri
