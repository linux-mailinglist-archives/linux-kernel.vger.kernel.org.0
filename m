Fair enough.  I would fix it differently, though:

static void update_this_cpu_umwait_msr(void)
{
  WARN_ON_ONCE(!irqs_disabled());  /* or local_irq_save() */

  /* We need to prevent umwait_control from being changed *and*
completing its WRMSR between our read and our WRMSR.  By turning IRQs
off here, we ensure that no sysfs write happens on this CPU and we
also make sure that any concurrent sysfs write from a different CPU
will not finish updating us via IPI until we're done. */
  wrmsrl(MSR_..., READ_ONCE(umwait_control), 0);
}
