Yes, it is, in /proc/[PID]/schedstat for CONFIG_SCHEDSTAT=y and in
/proc/[PID]/sched for CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y

By 'raw' I meant values that are stored in task_struct without
processing by cputime_adjust() -> scale_stime(). Idea is that
user space can make scaling using floating point, so do not have
to drop precision if numbers are big. 

That was discussed on my RFC and PATCH series posts:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1364489605-5443-1-git-send-email-sgruszka@redhat.com/
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1365066635-2959-1-git-send-email-sgruszka@redhat.com/

There was objection that even if kernel does not tell what utime/stime
values mean exactly, users already got used to scaled behaviour and
changing this is 'semantic' ABI breakage. And obviously this would make
'top hiding' worm working again for unpatched top.

So perhaps we can add new exports of not-scaled utime/stime and achieve
the same goal without changing the meaning of existing fields. From
other hand, maybe nowadays better tools exist to provide exact cputimes
to user space i.e. 'perf stat' or bpf, so proposed addition is unneeded.
