Thanks Lars, I appreciate your patch.  

Your unaligned zerout code in drbd_issue_discard_or_zero_out() looks 
great.  I particulary like how you adjusted max_discard_sectors to the 
granularity, as well as alignment handling.  Well thought out.

Your commit notes that "for backward compatibility, P_TRIM means zero-out, 
unless the DRBD_FF_WZEROES feature flag is agreed upon during handshake."

We test our environment by deploying the newer kernel on one of the DRBD 
servers and checking for regressions---but this will cause a zero-out on 
the new server because the old server doesn't yet support DRBD_FF_WZEROES.

For our purpose, can you think of any reason that it would be unsafe to 
hack the following into drbd_do_features() so the newer version will not 
zero-out while we test and get both nodes up to the newer version?
