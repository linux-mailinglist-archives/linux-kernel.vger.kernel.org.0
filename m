My point is why we couldn't do readahead if the marker page is under PG_writeback.
It was there for a long time and you were adding one more so I was curious what's
reasoning comes from. Let me find why PageWriteback check in
page_cache_async_readahead from the beginning.

	fe3cba17c4947, mm: share PG_readahead and PG_reclaim

The reason comes from the description

    b) clear PG_readahead => implicit clear of PG_reclaim
            one(and only one) page will not be reclaimed in time
            it can be avoided by checking PageWriteback(page) in readahead first

The goal was to avoid delay freeing of the page by clearing PG_reclaim.
I'm saying that I feel it's over optimization. IOW, it would be okay to
lose a page to be accelerated reclaim.

I'm saying live lock siutation below.
It would be hard to trigger since IO is very slow but isn't it possible
theoretically?

Let's consider ra_pages, too as I mentioned. Isn't it another hole to make
such live lock if other task suddenly reset it to zero?

void page_cache_async_readahead(..)
{
        /* no read-ahead */
        if (!ra->ra_pages)
                return;
