Sorry, it's indeed pretty confusing. I'll send a new version with a fixed
description if there is no major push back.

An UP device will most likely not have a MPIDR. That said I'm not sure this=
 is
always true. As per ARM1176JZ's TRM[1], the RPi1 CPU, if one was to get the
MPIDR it would raise an undefined exception.

The way I see it's an acceptable outcome as the DT is clearly wrong.

Regarda,
Nicolas
