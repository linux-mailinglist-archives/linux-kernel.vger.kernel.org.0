hum, we already have the CTF conversion support (perf data convert --to-ctf),
perhaps we could add support for profile.proto, so you dont need special app

I think that once we have the mmap interface in place we can
discuss some higher level interface that would help you

same as above, once we have mmap support I think this is
one of the things we definitely want to add to libperf

libperf has currently the full object separation, so outside users
dont see its object struct's inners.. that should solve the 'new' issue

libperf will be public so the building should be hopefuly simpler
and straightforward

thanks a lot for the feedback,
