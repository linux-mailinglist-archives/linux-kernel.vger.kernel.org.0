I don't see how is this relevant here.

barrier in __pte_alloc() for very the following case:

CPU 0							CPU 1
__pte_alloc():                                          pte_offset_kernel(pmd_t * dir, unsigned long address):
     pgtable_t new = pte_alloc_one(mm);                        pte_t *new = (pte_t *) pmd_page_vaddr(*dir) + ((address >> PAGE_SHIFT) & (PTRS_PER_PAGE - 1));  
     smp_wmb();                                                smp_read_barrier_depends();
     pmd_populate(mm, pmd, new);
							/* do something with pte, e.g. check if (pte_none(*new)) */


It's needed to ensure that if CPU1 sees pmd_populate() it also sees initialized contents of the 'new'.

In our case the barrier would have been needed if we had the other side like this:

if (!pte_none(*vmalloc_shadow_pte)) {
	shadow_addr = (unsigned long)__va(pte_pfn(*vmalloc_shadow_pte) << PAGE_SHIFT);
	smp_read_barrier_depends();
	*shadow_addr; /* read the shadow, barrier ensures that if we see installed pte, we will see initialized shadow memory. */
}


Without such other side the barrier is pointless.
