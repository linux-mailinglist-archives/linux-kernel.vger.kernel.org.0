Time sync support was removed, no?  I don't see MHI_DEVICE_TIMESYNC used 
anywhere in the code.

I'm happy the optional/required is listed.  However if I look at this 
from the perspective of someone writing a controller for the first time, 
I'm not confident the required/optional annotations are clear enough. 
Perhaps a quick sentance explaining that those annotations indicate 
fields which must be populated prior to mhi_register_controller() ?

This was for the old ioctl support, right?  I don't see it used anywhere.
