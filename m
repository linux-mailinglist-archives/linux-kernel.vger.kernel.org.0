Not with the default mode for the SSP, all clocks are enabled at trigger 
time.
We can enable the MCLK and BCLK ahead of time (which would require a 
change in firmware). But if we want to enable the FSYNC (word-clock), 
then we have to trigger DMA transfers with pretend-buffers, this is a 
lot more invasive.

So just to be clear, which of the MCLK, BCLK, FSYNC do you need enabled?

IIRC we recently did a change to deal with underflows. Ranjani, can you 
remind us what the issue was?
Thanks
