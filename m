It seems we have landed in the similar thinking here. As mentioned in my
earlier email in this thread I can see the extensibility to be achieved
by eBPF. Essentially we would have a base form of the oom report like
now and scripts would then hook in there to provide whatever a specific
usecase needs. My practical experience with eBPF is close to zero so I
have no idea how that would actually work out though.

I am not sure I understand. There must be somebody trusted to take care
of systems, right?
