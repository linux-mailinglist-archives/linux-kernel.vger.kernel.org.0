All I am saying is: Do not speculate in changelog. Make clear arguments.
So far we have seen many false positives and that is stated in the
wording I have suggested. It is also explained why those suck. There is
also a note that _some_ consoles might indeed deadlock. Compare that to
the original changelog which doesn't really saying anything useful about
those lockdep splats.

I obviously do not insist on my wording but please make the changelog
clear on the actual problem and stick to facts.

Thanks!
