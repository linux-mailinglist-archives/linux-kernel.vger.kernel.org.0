Yeah which we regret now. We need to now roll out a new set of
modifiers for at least some of the differences in these on the
modern-ish chips (the old crap is pretty much lost cause anyway).

This was kinda a nasty hack to smooth things over since we have epic
amounts of userspace, but it's really not a great idea (and no one
else really has epic amounts of existing userspace that uses tiling
flags everywhere, this is all new code).

The trouble is if you mix&match IP cores, and one of them supports
flavours A, B, C and the other C, D, E. But all you have is a single
magic modifier for "whatever the flavour is that soc prefers". So
someone gets to stuff this in DT.

Also eventually, maybe, perhaps ARM does grow up into the
client/server space with add-on pcie graphics, and at least for client
you very often end up with integrated + add-in pcie gpu. At that point
you really can't have magic per-soc modifiers anymore.

If people get confused I'm happy to add a "WARNING: This was a dumb
idea for backwards compat with legacy code, no one with new stuff ever
repeat it" to the i915 modifers.
