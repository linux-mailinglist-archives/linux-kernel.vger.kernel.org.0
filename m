What control does this device offer in those 0x100 registers?

Are the ROMs all controlled via SPI?

Complexity.

[NB: Please Don't assume that just because I accepted a driver into
     MFD 6 years ago, that it would be accepted again today.]

To me this looks like an MTD device which is controlled via SPI.

The way I'm reading this currently, it might serve well to make the
MTD portion(s) children of the SPI controller.  I still do not see a
compelling reason to warrant adding a superfluous MFD driver if at all
avoidable.
