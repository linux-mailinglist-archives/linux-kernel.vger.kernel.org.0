Yep but with your change it's getting better.

It's not available in chroot, which is the main driver for getrandom()
I guess.

Oh I definitely know it's been a long debate.

We've hit it the hard way more than a year ago already, when openssl
adopted getrandom() instead of urandom for certain low-importance
things in order to work better in chroots and/or avoid fd leaks. And
even openssl had to work around these issues in multiple iterations
(I don't remember how however).

In my case the whole system is in the initramfs and the only accesses
to the flash are to read the config. So that's pretty a limited source
of interrupts for a headless system ;-)

I think the timeout is a good thing to do, but it would be nice to
let the application know that what was provided was probably not as
good as expected (well if the application wants real random, it
should use GRND_RANDOM).

It's sad to see that being excessive on randomness leads to forcing
totally unrelated subsystem to be less efficient :-(
