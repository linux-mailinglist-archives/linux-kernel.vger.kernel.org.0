Hello Dear Friend,

My name is Mr.Tansoba kanbu. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation  with you in the execution of the deal described here-under
for our both  mutual benefit and I hope you will keep it a top secret
because of the nature  of the transaction, During the course of our bank
year auditing, I discovered  an unclaimed/abandoned fund, sum total of
{US$19.3 Million United State  Dollars} in the bank account that belongs to
a Saudi Arabia businessman Who unfortunately
lost his life and entire family in a Motor Accident.

Now our bank has been waiting for any of the relatives to come-up for the
claim but nobody has done that. I personally has been unsuccessful in
locating any of the relatives, now, I sincerely seek your consent to
present you as the next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased so that
the proceeds of this account valued at {US$19.3 Million United State
Dollars} can be paid to you, which we will share in these percentages
ratio, 60% to me and 40% to you. All I request is your utmost sincere
co-operation; trust and maximum confidentiality to achieve this project
successfully. I have carefully mapped out the moralities for execution of
this transaction under a legitimate arrangement to protect you from any
breach of the law both in your country and here in Burkina Faso when the
fund is being transferred to your bank account.

I will have to provide all the relevant document that will be requested to
indicate that you are the rightful beneficiary of this legacy and our bank
will release the fund to you without any further delay, upon your
consideration and acceptance of this offer, please send me the following
information as stated below so we can proceed
and get this fund transferred to your designated bank account immediately.

-Your Full Name:
-Your Contact Address:
-Your direct Mobile telephone Number:
-Your Date of Birth:

I await your swift response so we commence this transaction immediately.

Best regards,
Mr.Tansoba kanbu
