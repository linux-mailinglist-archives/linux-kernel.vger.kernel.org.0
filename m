Ah no, I was confused because this series is not bisectable (in addition
to doing two things at a same time, namely the monolithic kvm.ko and the
retpoline eliminations).

I have picked up the patches that are independent of the monolithic
kvm.ko work or can be considered bugfixes.

For the rest, please do this before posting again:

- ensure that everything is bisectable

- look into how to remove the modpost warnings.  A simple (though
somewhat ugly) way is to keep a kvm.ko module that includes common
virt/kvm/ code as well as, for x86 only, page_track.o.  A few functions,
such as kvm_mmu_gfn_disallow_lpage and kvm_mmu_gfn_allow_lpage, would
have to be moved into mmu.h, but that's not a big deal.

- provide at least some examples of replacing the NULL kvm_x86_ops
checks with error codes in the function (or just early "return"s).  I
can help with the others, but remember that for the patch to be merged,
kvm_x86_ops must be removed completely.

Thanks,

Paolo
