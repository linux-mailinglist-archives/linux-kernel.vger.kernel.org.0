It also looks like we call wakeup_source_register() and get lucky that
they're both called alarmtimer but they don't conflict with each other
in sysfs. Once we try to add a device named "alarmtimer" to the platform
bus it is the only one that can be added. I'll have to make this
autogenerate some number for the device instead of using -1 as the id so
that we don't see device name conflicts on the same bus.
