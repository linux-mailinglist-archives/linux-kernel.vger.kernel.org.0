As part of my testing for this work, I added a log statement to
mdp5_crtc_pp_done_irq() and it shows that a PP_IRQ comes in consistently
every ~0.0166 seconds, which is about 60 HZ. Without this change, plus
the 3 commits I mentioned in an earlier email related to the async
commit support, the PP IRQs come in at a variety of times: between every
~0.0140 and ~0.2224 seconds. That's why I assumed that this was working.

If I call send_start_signal() inside mdp5_crtc_atomic_enable(), then the
display does not work properly.

Ain't that the truth...
