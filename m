Only one interface (numbered 234!).

Your patch adds a line saying:

> +	usb_get_intf(acm->control); /* undone in destroy() */

but I don't see any destroy() function in that source file.  Did you 
mean acm_port_destruct()?

In any case, I don't know if this missing "get" would cause the 
problem, but it might well.
