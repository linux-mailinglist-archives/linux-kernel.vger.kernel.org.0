Documentation is great, but if we document something that is broken then it's 
still broken :)

I think this needs to just be redone -- we keep running into issues here and 
fixing them, but there are probably more issues and it'll probably be faster to 
just think through the memory map than to keep fixing bugs as they crop up.  
This was one of the areas of the port I didn't rewrite as part of the upstream 
submission process, and as a result it's pretty crusty.
