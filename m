Generally, I'd agree that approaching this incrementally makes sense, but
in this case you're adding new device-tree properties
("qcom,smmu-500-fw-impl-safe-errata") in order to do so, which seems
questionable if they're only going to be used in the short-term and will
be obsolete once Linux knows how to drive the device properly.

Instead, I think this needs to be part of a separate file that is maintained
by you, which follows on from the work that Krishna is doing for nvidia
built on top of Robin's prototype patches:

http://linux-arm.org/git?p=linux-rm.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/iommu/smmu-impl

Once we have that, you can key this behaviour off the compatible string
rather than having to add quirk properties to reflect the transient needs of
Linux.

Krishna -- how have you been getting on with the branch above?

Will
