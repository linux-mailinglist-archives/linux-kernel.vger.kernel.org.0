BTW, is there any reason why
not use %progbits all the time?


include/linux/init.h hard-codes %progbits

   #define __INITDATA .section ".init.data","aw",%progbits
   #define __INITRODATA .section ".init.rodata","a",%progbits


So, my understanding is '%' works for all architectures,
but it is better to ask 0-day bot to test it.
