+ some Android folks who are looking into libabigail

(root thread for context:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKwvOdnJAApaUhTQs7w_VjSeYBQa0c-TNxRB4xPLi0Y0sOQMMQ@mail.gmail.com/)

I'm only roughly aware of their issue/work, but hopefully they can
collaborate and add their insights to a list of requirements we could
collect, for any kind of replacement to CONFIG_MODVERSIONS/genksyms.
I'm not sure if they were planning on presenting this work at Linux
Plumber's Conference coming up or not, but I hope so.  Hopefully that
work will be a general solution for all kernel developers and distros,
not just Android.

This issue is now blocking my compiler upgrade, so I'm going to focus
on just fixing the yacc based parser to understand __attribute__'s on
struct/enum/union declarations.

Speaking with Arnd about this issue, he came up with the test case:
$ echo 'struct __attribute__((packed)) foo { char bar; int baz; };' |
./scripts/genksyms/genksyms -d
Hash table occupancy 0/4096 = 0
$ echo 'struct __attribute__((packed)) foo { char bar; };' |
./scripts/genksyms/genksyms -d
Hash table occupancy 0/4096 = 0

The implication being that because attributes don't parse correctly,
these symbols get a hash value of 0x00 in Module.symvers, meaning we
currently can't detect size changes of packed structs (or any other
attribute-qualified type) and happily proceed loading modules with
different ABIs than the kernel.

I'll probably add some kind of script for unit tests for genksyms,
too.  Feels like overkill for something known to be broken where
active replacements are being discussed, but it's blocking my compiler
upgrade for our products, so I'm just going to fix it for now.
