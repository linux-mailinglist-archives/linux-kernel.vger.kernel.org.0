 Data Races
 ----------

-and at least one of them is a write operation. In an execution, two memory
-operations from different threads form a **data race** if they *conflict*, at
-least one of them is a *plain access* (non-atomic), and they are *unordered* in
-the "happens-before" order according to the `LKMM
-<../../tools/memory-model/Documentation/explanation.txt>`_.

-Relationship with the Linux Kernel Memory Model (LKMM)
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Relationship with the Linux-Kernel Memory Consistency Model (LKMM)
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 The LKMM defines the propagation and ordering rules of various memory
 operations, which gives developers the ability to reason about concurrent code.
 Ultimately this allows to determine the possible executions of concurrent code,
 and if that code is free from data races.
 
-KCSAN is aware of *atomic* accesses (``READ_ONCE``, ``WRITE_ONCE``,
-``atomic_*``, etc.), but is oblivious of any ordering guarantees. In other
-words, KCSAN assumes that as long as a plain access is not observed to race
-with another conflicting access, memory operations are correctly ordered.
+KCSAN is aware of *marked atomic operations* (``READ_ONCE``, ``WRITE_ONCE``,
+``atomic_*``, etc.), but is oblivious of any ordering guarantees and simply
+assumes that memory barriers are placed correctly. In other words, KCSAN
+assumes that as long as a plain access is not observed to race with another
+conflicting access, memory operations are correctly ordered.
 
 This means that KCSAN will not report *potential* data races due to missing
-memory ordering. If, however, missing memory ordering (that is observable with
-a particular compiler and architecture) leads to an observable data race (e.g.
-entering a critical section erroneously), KCSAN would report the resulting
-data race.
-
-Race conditions vs. data races
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Race conditions are logic bugs, where unexpected interleaving of racing
-concurrent operations result in an erroneous state.
-
-Data races on the other hand are defined at the *memory model/language level*.
-Many data races are also harmful race conditions, which a tool like KCSAN
-reports!  However, not all data races are race conditions and vice-versa.
-KCSAN's intent is to report data races according to the LKMM. A data race
-detector can only work at the memory model/language level.
-
-Deeper analysis, to find high-level race conditions only, requires conveying
-the intended kernel logic to a tool. This requires (1) the developer writing a
-specification or model of their code, and then (2) the tool verifying that the
-implementation matches. This has been done for small bits of code using model
-checkers and other formal methods, but does not scale to the level of what can
-be covered with a dynamic analysis based data race detector such as KCSAN.

-For reasons outlined in this `article <https://lwn.net/Articles/793253/>`_,
-data races can be much more subtle, but can cause no less harm than high-level
-race conditions.
+memory ordering. Developers should therefore carefully consider the required
+memory ordering requirements that remain unchecked. If, however, missing
+memory ordering (that is observable with a particular compiler and
+architecture) leads to an observable data race (e.g. entering a critical
+section erroneously), KCSAN would report the resulting data race.
+
+Race Detection Beyond Data Races
+--------------------------------
+
+For code with complex concurrency design, race-condition bugs may not always
+manifest as data races. Race conditions occur if concurrently executing
+operations result in unexpected system behaviour. On the other hand, data races
+are defined at the C-language level. The following macros can be used to check
+properties of concurrent code where bugs would not manifest as data races.

 Implementation Details
 ----------------------
 
-The general approach is inspired by `DataCollider
+KCSAN relies on observing that two accesses happen concurrently. Crucially, we
+want to (a) increase the chances of observing races (especially for races that
+manifest rarely), and (b) be able to actually observe them. We can accomplish
+(a) by injecting various delays, and (b) by using address watchpoints (or
+breakpoints).
+
+If we deliberately stall a memory access, while we have a watchpoint for its
+address set up, and then observe the watchpoint to fire, two accesses to the
+same address just raced. Using hardware watchpoints, this is the approach taken
+in `DataCollider
 <http://usenix.org/legacy/events/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Erickson.pdf>`_.
 Unlike DataCollider, KCSAN does not use hardware watchpoints, but instead
-relies on compiler instrumentation. Watchpoints are implemented using an
-efficient encoding that stores access type, size, and address in a long; the
-benefits of using "soft watchpoints" are portability and greater flexibility in
-limiting which accesses trigger a watchpoint.

+watchpoints" are portability and greater flexibility. KCSAN then relies on the
+compiler instrumenting plain accesses. For each instrumented plain access:
 
 1. Check if a matching watchpoint exists; if yes, and at least one access is a
    write, then we encountered a racing access.
 
 2. Periodically, if no matching watchpoint exists, set up a watchpoint and

+   stall for a small randomized delay.
 
 3. Also check the data value before the delay, and re-check the data value
    after delay; if the values mismatch, we infer a race of unknown origin.
 
-To detect data races between plain and atomic memory operations, KCSAN also
-annotates atomic accesses, but only to check if a watchpoint exists
-(``kcsan_check_atomic_*``); i.e.  KCSAN never sets up a watchpoint on atomic
-accesses.
+To detect data races between plain and marked accesses, KCSAN also annotates
+marked accesses, but only to check if a watchpoint exists; i.e. KCSAN never

+are properly marked, KCSAN will never trigger a watchpoint and therefore never
