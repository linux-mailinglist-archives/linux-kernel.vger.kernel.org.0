Ping ? I had another look today and I don't feel like mucking around
with all the AQ size logic, AEN magic tag etc... just for that sake of
that Apple gunk. I'm happy to have it give up IO tags, it doesn't seem
to make much of a difference in practice anyway.

But if you feel strongly about it, then I'll implement the "proper" way
sometimes this week, adding a way to shrink the AQ down to something
like 3 (one admin request, one async event (AEN), and the empty slot)
by making a bunch of the constants involved variables instead.

This leas to a question: Wouldn't be be nicer/cleaner to make AEN be
tag 0 of the AQ ? That way we just include it as reserved tag ? Not a
huge different from what we do now, just a thought.

Cheers,
Ben.
