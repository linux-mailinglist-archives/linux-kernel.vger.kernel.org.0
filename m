Part of the reason is, CPTR_EL2 has different layout depending on
whether HCR_EL2.E2H == 1. e.g, CPTR_EL2.TTA move from Bit[28] to Bit[20].

So, to keep it simple, CPTR_EL2 is used for non-VHE code with the shifts
as defined by the "CPTR_EL2 when E2H=0"

if E2H == 1, CPTR_EL2 takes the layout of CPACR_EL1 and "overrides" some
of the RES0 bits in CPACR_EL1 with EL2 controls (e.g: TAM, TCPAC).
Thus we use CPACR_EL1 to keep the "shifts" non-conflicting (e.g, ZEN)
and is the right thing to do.

It is a bit confusing, but we are doing the right thing. May be we could 
improve the comment like :

	/*
	 * With VHE (HCR.E2H == 1), CPTR_EL2 has the same layout as
	 * CPACR_EL1, except for some missing controls, such as TAM.
	 * And accesses to CPACR_EL1 are routed to CPTR_EL2.
	 * Also CPTR_EL2.TAM has the same position with or without
	 * HCR.E2H == 1. Therefore, use CPTR_EL2.TAM here for
	 * trapping the AMU accesses.
	 */
