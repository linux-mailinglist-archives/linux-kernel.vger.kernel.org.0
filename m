Yes.  Specifically bochs-drm.ko and efifb in virtual machines.

Well, the drm driver is loaded by udev like everything else.

Dunno what plymouth (graphical boot screen tool) does to handle the
situation.  I guess listening to udev events.  So it should notice efifb
going away and drop the /dev/fb0 reference, but this races against
bochs-drm initializing.

Pulled out something out of thin air which I expect being on the safe
side.  plymouth responding on the udev event should need only a small
fraction of that.

cheers,
