No, I was pointing out that I myself had already asked pretty much the
same questions you just asked me. How did you expect me to have answers
to your "Shouldn't this be a read/modify/write sequence?" then? It
seemed like you missed my questions up there:

Without knowing how the register is structured, I can't implement a
read/modify/write sequence - for that we'd need to know whether it's a
single bit we can just set or a field that we would need to mask first
before writing into it.

And ideally we would be getting its address from DT, so we would need to
know whether it's just this one register or some contiguous IP block
such as "arm,armv7-timer-mem". Same issue whether we implement it in the
kernel or in U-Boot btw. If it's no standard Arm register, we'll need to
have a binding with a sensible compatible string, some REG_ constant to
replace the magic offset number and some meaningful constant for 0x1.

Dispute that with U-Boot maintainers then, please, and let me know the
outcome. I just had an argument with Neil that it's not okay to import
from linux-next.git and that it must be an -rc1 or other stable tag. (My
VIM3 patch submission before Plumbers was not accepted for that reason,
and I haven't found time for U-Boot since.)

No, I'm not, that was my point! :( We do _not_ have all those drivers
needed for a useful U-Boot implemented for the mainline kernel yet. Like
I said, I'm using a Busybox initrd for testing RTD1195 (also RTD1293,
RTD1296 and RTD1395). And I've already amassed 140+ patches on top of
-next without those core drivers - I really need to get that queue down
for sensible collaboration with Realtek and others.

I need people to be able to help contribute those drivers to the kernel,
therefore I need to get the basics merged, so that Realtek and community
members can base patches on top, so that we get there over time.
If you're asking that someone do a new U-Boot before we can even get a
timer or GIC DT node merged, then we're doomed and I'm wasting my time
here. Rob did give a Reviewed-by for the DT, so I would've thought it
can't be that terrible!

As I pointed out above, we need to get the .dts[i] into some -rc1 kernel
release for U-Boot to pull them. If you're blocking to merge RTD1195
into v5.6-rc1 here, we're not gonna get even a driver-less mainline
U-Boot for it in about 8 weeks. Chicken-and-egg problem.

And my experience with U-Boot has been that if U-Boot patches don't get
merged immediately, other people will duplicate that work later without
crediting me, so that my time spent on U-Boot would be wasted. And the
same is happening with the kernel if we don't get my patches merged in
some form - you already witnessed Aleix doing his own irqchip driver
instead of collaborating on the one that went through three rounds of
review already (and now he's disappeared again without input for me, so
I'm preparing to send you a v4 tonight or tomorrow). STM32 was another
bad experience (and I still have two further v7-M ports to clean up).

With the GeekBox, that I'm the official U-Boot maintainer of, I managed
to shoot myself in the foot, unable to recover from a U-Boot I flashed.
So I am very hesitant to repeat that, especially with RTD1195 hardware
that's no longer sold (X1000).

And the work of the sunXi community - including Bootlin and Arm people -
is commendable and inspiring (e.g., meson-tools).

My time as single person is limited for this night-time project though,
so it's unrealistic to ask me to reverse-engineer a new BL31 without
sources, write a U-Boot implementation and port the kernel, all at once.
Especially when I don't know how to even test those other components.
Maybe that's clear to you - for me it isn't. The RTD1395, where I do
have U-Boot sources for BPi-M4 [2] and get it loaded as file from SD by
a previous bootloader, is not affected by this RTD1195 timer problem;
yet I don't see how from any given U-Boot (or LK) I would be able to
load a new BL31 on RTD1295/RTD1395, nor how to load a HYP capable U-Boot
on RTD1195. I thought it's impossible to escape to higher ELs? And for
ARMv7 I thought U-Boot was neither relocatable not reentrant?

Now, I can continue carrying this commit in my GitHub tree for myself,
like I do for spin-table, if Olof and Arnd agree with you that this 8/8
should not be merged, even if we clarify this register. But I just don't
see the time right now for doing alone what the sunxi community have
achieved together over the course of many years, with Realtek in my neck
for new kernel patches.

The context here is that most of the drivers seen on RTD1295 and later
originated in RTD1195, so for sane compatible strings (cf. watchdog [3],
rtc [4] discussions!) we need to be able to test RTD1195 and to base
patches, such as upcoming irqchip mux v4, on all four+ SoC families.
Realtek appears to be focused on the new RTD1619/RTD1319, and I would
really like to avoid merging drivers for those new chips only and caring
about bindings and compatibility with the three earlier SoC families as
afterthought, repeating the mistakes I made with RTD1295 vs. RTD1195 for
lack of hardware at the time.

I don't think that I'm pushing into a wrong direction; we just disagree
about the steps to get there. I would like people to be able to take a
mainline kernel and boot on RTD1195 without getting stuck; if they have
to use a GitHub tree to successfully boot, then it's not really mainline
yet. Booting with only one CPU up is much less severe by comparison, as
it allows to probe all drivers and to explore sysfs and debugfs.

Keep in mind that I started RTD1295 mainlining without having any BSP
sources at all, which is less than the sunxi folks had to go on.

The key on sunxi, I thought, was that you had the FEL tools to just load
bootloader binaries dynamically over USB. For Amlogic we at least had
binary blobs and binary tools integrated into U-Boot build process and
an idea where to place them on SD to boot them - here I have only what
is on eMMC/SPI, no docs. Also, I do recall a long time where sunxi had
GitHub repos with downstream BSP forks - I'd rather not get into that
business and immediately skip to making mainline more and more usable.

If of course Realtek or one of their OEMs or some other community member
wanted to work on providing a rebased U-Boot in a Git repo, that would
be great. Once we have it working, we could drop workarounds like these.

A quick git-grep finds 277 occurrences of .init_time in arch/arm/mach-*,
so hardly a callback about to get dropped.

Andreas
