The arch in the filename is redundant.  It would be a bit nicer if it
were named "special.h" but I guess that would conflict with the non-arch
special.h, unless we put non-arch headers and arch headers in separate
namespaces somehow.  Maybe it's ok for now unless anybody has a better
idea.

Instead of the above can you use the SPDX identifier?

And the same comment for the other headers in the patch set.
