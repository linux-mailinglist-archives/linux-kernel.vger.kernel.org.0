__vfs_getxattr (the way the security layer acquires the target sid 
without recursing back to security to check the access permissions) 
calls get xattr method, which in overlayfs calls vfs_getxattr on the 
lower layer (which then recurses back to security to check permissions) 
and reports back -EACCES if there was a denial (which is OK) and _no_ 
sid copied to caller's inode security data, bubbles back to the security 
layer caller, which reports an invalid avc: message for 
u:object_r:unlabeled:s0 (the uninitialized sid instead of the sid for 
the lower filesystem target). The blocked access is 100% valid, it is 
supposed to be blocked. This does however result in a cosmetic issue 
that makes it impossible to use audit2allow to construct a rule that 
would be usable to fix the access problem.

This problem would exist for any (in tree or out-of-tree) union 
filesystems that need to reflect the __vfs_getxattr call into a 
__vfs_getxattr call to the underlying filesystem.

The mounter merely does not have access to the targets in one of the 
referenced filesystems (for override creds = on)

In Android would be init, it does not have access to a subset of 
u:object_r:*_exec:s0 and u::objects_r:vendor*:s0 labels. Based on a need 
to access basis.

This gets worse if we add override creds = off, because the multitude of 
callers could be denied access, and rightfully so, and we would have no 
clue how to construct rules to grant them permissions using standard 
tools like audit2allow.

I will figure out how to explain this in the commit message ... but do 
tell me if I did not 'connect' you to the underlying problem so I can 
make it clear to _everyone_.

Yes __get (instead of the existing get which checks sepolicy) was my 
idea. get_wo_security was a close alternative.

We worked through 5 "solutions", this one privately appeared to please 
the security folks. In fact the solution was their suggestion because 
they noticed that __vfs_getxattr was meant to bypass sepolicy checking, 
yet when nested through overlayfs, it called vfs_getxattr for the lower 
filesystems and blocked necessary content (sid actually) from the upper 
call in order to properly log the denial. I had originally copied just 
the sid to the upper caller by adding layering violations that creeped 
them out ;-/
