(I don't think this is correct, its just usually invisible as PSTATE.D is normally clear)

This is pretty complicated. Just to check I've understood this properly:
Stepping on a kprobe in a kprobe-user's pre_handler will cause the remainder of the
handler (the first one) to run with PSTATE.D clear. Once we enable single-step, we start
stepping the debug handler, and will never step the original kprobe'd instruction.

This is describing the most complicated way that this problem shows up! (I agree its also
the worst)

I can get this to show up with just one kprobe. (function/file names here are meaningless):

| static int wibble(struct seq_file *m, void *discard)
| {
|        unsigned long d, flags;
|
|        flags = local_daif_save();
|
|        kprobe_me();
|        d = read_sysreg(daif);
|        local_daif_restore(flags);
|
|        seq_printf(m, "%lx\n", d);
|
|        return 0;
| }

plumbed into debugfs, then kicked using the kprobe_example module:
| root@adam:/sys/kernel/debug# cat wibble
| 3c0

| root@adam:/sys/kernel/debug# insmod ~morse/kprobe_example.ko symbol=kprobe_me
| [   69.478098] Planted kprobe at [..]
| root@adam:/sys/kernel/debug# cat wibble
| [   71.478935] <kprobe_me> pre_handler: p->addr = [..], pc = [..], pstate = 0x600003c5
| [   71.488942] <kprobe_me> post_handler: p->addr = [..], pstate = 0x600001c5
| 1c0

| root@adam:/sys/kernel/debug#

This is problem for any code that had debug masked, not just kprobes.

Can we start the commit-message with the simplest description of the problem: kprobes
manipulates the interrupted PSTATE for single step, and doesn't restore it.

(trying to understand this bug through kprobe's interaction with itself is hard!)

We should probably move this to daifflags.h. Its going to be useful to other series too.


Patch looks good!

(I haven't tried to test the nested kprobes case...)


Thanks,
