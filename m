Sorry I didn't reply earlier. I'm going to write a kernel-doc to
describe how to write a "modern" clk driver which should hopefully help
here.

The gist is that you can fill out a clk_parent_data array or a clk_hw
array and set the .name and .fw_name and .index in the clk_parent_data
array to indicate which clks to get from the DT node's "clocks" and
"clock-names" properties.

, axi_div * ahb_div);

Take this one for example. If 'hpll' is actually a clk_hw pointer in
hand, then you could do something like:

	clk_hw_register_fixed_factor_parent_hw(NULL, "ahb", &hpll, 0, 1, axi_div *=
 ahb_div);

And if it's something like a clock from DT you could do

	struct clk_parent_data pdata =3D {
		.name =3D "hpll",
		.fw_name =3D <clock-names string>,
		.index =3D <whatever clock index it is>
	};

	clk_hw_register_fixed_factor_parent_data(NULL, "ahb", &pdata, 0, 1, axi_di=
v * ahb_div);

I haven't actually written the clk_hw_register_fixed_factor_*() APIs,
because I'm thinking that it would be better to register the pdata with
some more parameters so that the
clk_hw_register_fixed_factor_parent_data() API becomes more like:

	clk_hw_register_fixed_factor_parent_data(NULL, "ahb", "hpll",
		<clock-names string>, <whatever clock index it is>, 0, 1,
		axi_div * ahb_div);

Because there's only one parent. For the mux clk it will be a pointer to
parent_data because I don't see a way around it.

Cool! Thanks.
