Bah. That's broken to begin with, but trivial to fix.

On all the upcoming CPUs?

So what prevents the stopper thread to run? It should be runnable right
after the point when the upcoming CPU reaches cpu_startup_entry(). The
stopper thread is unparked _before_ the hotplug thread on the upcoming
CPU is woken.

No. sched_clock() is separate. It uses a raw timestamp (in your case
from the ARM arch timer) and converts it to something which is close to
proper time. So my assumption was based on the printout Waiman had:

 [ 1... ] CPU.... watchdog_fn now  170000000
 [ 25.. ] CPU.... watchdog_fn now 4170000000

I assumed that now comes from ktime_get() or something like
that. Waiman?

The printk timestamps come from sched_clock().

The scheduler is active right at the point where the upcoming CPU
reaches cpu_startup_entry()

No.

The onlining through the firmware call is just a tiny part of the
hotplug procedure. Hotplug does:

 Control CPU              Upcoming CPU

 prepare_stuff_for_cpu()
 kick_cpu_alive()         <- Firmware call, IPI, whatever

 wait_for_idle()
                          Low level init
                          cpu_startup_entry()
 unpark_stopper()
 kick_hotplug_thread()
                          thread context init

 wait_for_online()
                          final state reached

But IF the firmware call takes ages, then the boot CPU which is
responsible for timekeeping at this point might actually miss timer
interrupts en masse. Let's assume the firmware call takes one second and
we have HZ 100.

Real time  Kernel time   Context
0.0        0.0           firmware call
1.0        0.01          timer interrupt
                         hotplug stuff
1.01       0.02          timer interrupt
...                       
1.05       0.05          firmware call
2.05       0.06          timer interrupt

That sums up quickly. And that would obviously cause the watchdog timers
to expire late as well as they are based on kernel time.

If the watchdog timer then fires after a while, the timestamp is already
off by more than the threshold and the lockup detector triggers.

So yes, this would be a very reasonable explanation. Let's do the math
for Waiman's example:

While sched clock advanced by 24.4 seconds kernel time advanced only by
4 seconds.

The whole hotplug machinery takes:

 [    0.115632] CPU1: Booted secondary processor 0x0000000100 [0x431f0af1]
 [   27.177282] CPU223: Booted secondary processor 0x0000011b03 [0x431f0af1]

27 seconds, which means ~120ms per CPU. 

From the time delta we know that we lost ~2000 timer interrupts in 24.4
seconds, which is about 24.4 / 0.12 ~= 203 CPUs.

Now 2000 timer interrupts (HZ=100) are 20 seconds which means that the
firmware call took about 100ms (20/203) per CPU.

Waiman also said, that on a HPE machine the clock delta was observable
as well, but not as bad, which means the firmware call there is
significantly shorter.

Of course this cannot be observed on x86 because all x86 does to kick a
secondary CPU into life is to send an IPI to it.

Hmm?
