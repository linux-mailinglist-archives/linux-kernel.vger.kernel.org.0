Thanks for this information. This is something that should be a part of
the changelog. I am sorry to still poke into this because I still do not
have a full understanding of what is going on and while I do not object
to drop the spinlock I still suspect this is papering over a deeper
problem.

If mark_page_accessed is really expensive then why do we even bother to
do it in the tear down path in the first place? Why don't we simply set
a referenced bit on the page to reflect the young pte bit? I might be
missing something here of course.
