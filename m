What's wrong with the broadcast timer if it is never utilized? It's there,
needs a few bytes of memory and that's it.

Sure, but that's applicable to your particular system only and not a
generic solution. Neither your DT hack, nor the other one you posted.

Right.

If the clock event device is affected by deep power states, then the core
requires a fallback device, aka. broadcast timer, which makes sure that no
event is lost in case that the CPU goes into a deep power state. If no CPU
ever goes deep, the broadcast timer is there and unused.

Obviously the system cannot enable high resolution timers if the clock
event device is affected by power states.

Unless you have a solution which works under all circumstances (and the
current patch definitely does not) then you have to deal with the
requirement of the broadcast timer (either physical or software based).

"I don't want a broadcast timer falls" into the "I want a pony" realm.
