You seem to have already done that below.  Not really sure what more you are
asking for here.

Yes.

I don't know what you mean by this.  I explained it above, and you clearly
understood it.

Because theres already a check of the same variety in do_IRQ, but if the
information is available outside the hotpath, I was unaware, and am happy to
update this patch to refelct that.
