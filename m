Yeah, I considered that, but there are several reasons to not to do that.
- trace_event seems enabled very early point than kprobes itself.(but this can
  be fixable)
- if user specifies kprobes at boot, he/she wants to enable that point at boot.
- it is redundant to specify kprobe_event= and trace_event=, especially command
  line size is very limited.

It should be possible, I will try to find what blocks it. I guess after we
switch early_text_poke() to text_poke(), we can use kprobes on x86. But
for other archs, I need to investigate more.

As I pointed above, I think we should enable it if user specify it. That's
less typing :). Anyway I'll recheck early kprobe availablity.

Thank you,
