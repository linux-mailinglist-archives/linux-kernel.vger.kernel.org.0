Not for certain no, but we do know that there are conditions whereby
node 0 can end up reclaiming excessively for extended periods of time.
The available evidence does match a pattern whereby a lower zone on node
0 is getting stuck in a boosted state.

If Rik can reproduce it great but I have a strong feeling that Ivan may
never be able to test this if it requires a production machine which is
why I did not wait the three weeks.

A debug patch would not help much in this case given that we
have tracepoints. An ftrace containing mm_page_alloc_extfrag,
mm_vmscan_kswapd_wake, mm_vmscan_wakeup_kswapd and
mm_vmscan_node_reclaim_begin would be a big help for 30 seconds while the
problem is occurring would work. Ideally mm_vmscan_lru_shrink_inactive
would also be included to capture the priority but the size of the trace
is what's going to be problematic.

mm_page_alloc_extfrag would be correlated with the conditions that boost
the watermarks and the others would track what kswapd is doing to see if
it's persistently reclaiming. If they are, mm_vmscan_lru_shrink_inactive
would tell if it's persistently reclaiming at priority DEF_PRIORITY - 2
which would prove the patch would at least mitigate the problem.

It would be more preferable to have a description of a testcase that
reproduces the problem and I'll capture/analyse the trace myself.
It would also be something I could slot into a test grid to catch the
problem happening again in the future.
