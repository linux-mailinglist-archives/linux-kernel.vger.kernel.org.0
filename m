For testing coverage purposes, exercising the relocation machinery etc
even on no-kaslr boots would be beneficial imo. (The kernel is
relocated once for non-kaslr boots and twice for kaslr boots on kaslr
capable kernels)

When you are debugging using GDB, it can get a bit tedious, since you
have to pass the offset when you load the symbols. However, in that
case, you can just pass 'nokaslr' unless you are debugging something
that is affected by the randomization.

For reading backtraces etc, nothing really changes, since we get
symbol+nnn/mmm entries (and the full panic log prints the KASLR offset
as well, in case it matters)

Yes, it would be good if we could fix that. In fact, I would argue
that having this change in would have increased the likelihood that
someone else would have spotted it and fixed it :-)

In fact, given how many Android phones are running this code: Nick,
can you check if there are any KASLR related kernel fixes that haven't
been upstreamed?

I think it is mostly controversial among non-security folks, who think
that every mitigation by itself should be bullet proof. Security folks
tend to think more about how each layer reduces the attack surface,
hopefully resulting in a secure system when all layers are enabled.

So KASLR is known to be broken unless you enable KPTI as well, so that
is something we could take into account. I.e., mitigations that don't
reduce the attack surface at all are just pointless complexity, which
should obviously be avoided.

Another thing to note is that the runtime cost of KASLR is ~zero, with
the exception of the module PLTs. However, the latter could do with
some additional coverage as well, so in summary, I think enabling this
is a good thing. Otherwise, we could disable full module randomization
so that the module PLT code doesn't get used in practice.
