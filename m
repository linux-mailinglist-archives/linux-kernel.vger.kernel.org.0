I can confirm that Fedora/CentOS/RHEL do not depend on default
config in kernel. Same seems to apply to Ubuntu, Arch and probably
others. We maintain our own configs.

I cannot talk for all distros (there are too many), but major desktop
distributions do that. For the 1st few RCs of a new kernel version I
will be adjusting Fedora/RISCV configuration based on whatever
changes land.

Of course looking at default defconfig is part of that process.

I would prefer to have a separate config for debug (that's what we do in
Fedora). Why not use config fragment here (e.g. call it debug.config like
in powerpc)?
