For QC PDC, it could be a large number of interrupts to remap which
interrupt-map doesn't scale to very well. Also, I think it sits in
parallel to the GIC rather than downstream. The interrupt binding
doesn't really have a way to express that.

Why? You should know where the register is because you know what chip
you are on (from the compatible).

If all of the scfg bits change, then if you have this property, it
should be in the scfg node. But I prefer you use the compatible
instead if that works.
