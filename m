That doesn't help much, since 4 affinities for one SPI is rather 
nonsensical.

If the SoC really has all 4 overflow interrupts combined into a single 
SPI line, then sampling just isn't going to be supported - it's 
unreasonably difficult to handle overflow when the IRQ may be taken on 
the wrong CPU.
