I agree it should be in the noise. But please do put it behind CONFIG_CMA
#ifdef. My x86_64 desktop distro kernel doesn't have CONFIG_CMA. Even if this is
effectively no-op with __rmqueue_cma_fallback() returning NULL immediately, I
think the compiler cannot eliminate the two zone_page_state()'s which are
atomic_long_read(), even if it's just ultimately READ_ONCE() here, that's a
volatile cast which means elimination not possible AFAIK? Other architectures
might be even more involved.

Otherwise I agree this is a reasonable solution until CMA is rewritten.
