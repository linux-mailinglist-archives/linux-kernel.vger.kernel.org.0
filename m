This reminds me of the old tty "control" devices we finally got rid of
many years ago.  The more things change... :)

Anyway, looks sane to me.  If you are ok with this userspace api, no
objection from me.

Only one comment below:

Don't try to segment your "dev" and "control" device nodes by minor
number range, as you will run into problems once you have a system with
more than 64 of these in the box at once.

Just use the whole range, and do:
	dev = minor N
	control = minor N+1
and so on.  That makes your control device node an "odd" minor and your
"real" device an "even".

Given that all existing systems should be using devtmpfs, you should not
have any problem with changing the minor number of them at the next
reboot, right?

thanks,
