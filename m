Will be fixed in next update.

See below about the tasklet.

Yes, this will be fixed.

I'll move these assigns to after obtaining the lock.

This seems to be kind of over cautiousness ;-)
I remove all intermediate members checks.

There are some comments below in loopback_snd_timer_event() function.
When the sound timer stops and the stream is in the draining state,
we still need to flush the data remaining in the buffer, and the regular
"elapsed" functions are called for that.

I re-structure this code a little to make all de-referencing inside the
lock.

Yes, I realized it a little late ;-)
So far I changed the loop to something like

	for (card_idx = 0; card_idx < snd_ecards_limit; card_idx++) {
		struct snd_card *card = snd_card_ref(card_idx);
		if (card) {
			if (!strcmp(card->id, name))
				err = 0;
			snd_card_unref(card);
		}
		if (!err)
			break;
	}

Of course, adding a separate lookup helper function to sound/core/init.c,
like, for example,
	struct snd_card *snd_card_find_id(const char *id)
that makes similar loop in a more "atomic" way, with proper locking and
reference incrementing for the result, would be more efficient, so if you
decide to create such a helper, that would help to eliminate this loop
from here.

Will be fixed too.

And this will be fixed.

Indeed, that flag is not set, and the regular callback is already called
from the tasklet. That's why the callback function, registered here
(loopback_snd_timer_function) does not use the tasklet.
However, the ccallback event handler is called by sound core directly,
without a tasklet, and within "spin_lock_irqsave(&timer->lock, flags)".
So, it's not possible to call snd_pcm_period_elapsed() directly
from ccallback function (loopback_snd_timer_event). In order to
be able to make this call, the local tasklet is used.

I'm preparing the next version of this patch set with the changes,
described above, and some more code cleanup. It will be submitted soon.

Thanks!
