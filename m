Sure, but why?

I thought this whole exercise is to make the process easier. This seems
to be making it more complex. Now we are going to be demanding
submitters to be basing their work on a specific (older) commit.

I always tell people that submit to me, to base off of one of Linus's
latest tags. That's what I do.
