So I viewed the comma-separated thing as allow us to describe facts about
the scale used.

In particular I suspect that some controllers will be non-linear *and*
non-perceptual and that some userspaces, particularly those that animate
backlight changes, may care enough about the difference to ask us to add
another fact to the set that describes that scale.

Having said that I do share your concern that the comma-separated list
is overengineered and that all userspaces will end up implementing
something like:

if (strstr("non-linear", scale) {
  mode = PERCEPTUAL;
} else if (strstr("unknown", scale) {
  mode = use_existing_hueristic();
} else {
  mode = LINEAR;
}

Agree.

The idea is that allows a userspace with simple backlight needs to
simple map the brightness property directly to a slider using the
approach above without worrying about perceptual or (possible future)
logarithmic scales. Such an approach won't be perfect but it
probably won't feel horrible for the user either.

Arguably the descriptions should move away from the raw factual
approach and describe what advise the kernel of offering the
userspace.

Depends how assertive the userspaces are!

If they follow the "fix kernel bugs in the kernel" mantra rather than
implement workarounds and heuristics then I suspect it would not be used
much.

I'm a little sceptical that we could calibrate an absolute scale on
enough devices for such a property to be useful. I think it would be
"unknown" on almost every system.
