GCC currently has 91696 bug reports.

No, I am talking exactly about what you brought up.  The flags output
for inline assembler, using the =@ syntax.  If I had implemented that
for Power when it first came up, I would by now have had to add support
for another flag (the CA32 flag).  Oh, and I would not have implemented
support for OV or SO at all originally, but perhaps they are useful, so
let's add that as well.  And there is OV32 now as well.

No, of course not, because we aren't silly enough to implement something
like that.

Ask them, not me.
