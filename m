umonitor, umwait, and tpause are a set of user wait instructions.

umonitor arms address monitoring hardware using an address. The
address range is determined by using CPUID.0x5. A store to
an address within the specified address range triggers the
monitoring hardware to wake up the processor waiting in umwait.

umwait instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state while monitoring a range of addresses. The optimized
state may be either a light-weight power/performance optimized state
(C0.1 state) or an improved power/performance optimized state
(C0.2 state).

tpause instructs the processor to enter an implementation-dependent
optimized state C0.1 or C0.2 state and wake up when time-stamp counter
reaches specified timeout.

The three instructions may be executed at any privilege level.

The instructions provide power saving method while waiting in
user space. Additionally, they can allow a sibling hyperthread to
make faster progress while this thread is waiting. One example of an
application usage of umwait is when waiting for input data from another
application, such as a user level multi-threaded packet processing
engine.

Availability of the user wait instructions is indicated by the presence
of the CPUID feature flag WAITPKG CPUID.0x07.0x0:ECX[5].

Detailed information on the instructions and CPUID feature WAITPKG flag
can be found in the latest Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions
and Future Features Programming Reference and Intel 64 and IA-32
Architectures Software Developer's Manual.
