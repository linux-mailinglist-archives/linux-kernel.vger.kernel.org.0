There are multiple dais per link, and multiple Slave per link, so we 
would have to refcount and track active dais to understand when the link 
needs to be turned on/off. It's a duplication of what the pm framework 
can do at the device/link level, and will likely introduce race conditions.

Not to mention that we'd need to introduce workqueues to turn the link 
off with a delay, with pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() does for free.

Linux is all about frameworks. For power management, we shall use the 
power management framework, not reinvent it.
