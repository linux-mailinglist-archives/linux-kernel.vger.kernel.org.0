We will be happy to document each of the macros in detail. Do note a
few things here:

* There is really nothing magical about them though, the LSM hooks are
  collectively declared in lsm_hook_names.h and are used to delcare
  the security_list_options and security_hook_heads for the LSM
  framework (this was previously maitained in two different places):

  For BPF, they declare:

    * bpf_lsm_<name> attachment points and their prototypes.
    * A static key (bpf_lsm_key_<name>) to enable and disable these
       hooks with a function to set its value i.e.
       (bpf_lsm_<name>_set_enabled).

* We have kept the BPF related macros out of security/.
* All the BPF calls in the LSM infrastructure are guarded by
  CONFIG_BPF_LSM (there are only two main calls though, i.e.
  call_int_hook, call_void_hook).

Honestly, the macros aren't any more complicated than
call_int_progs/call_void_progs.
