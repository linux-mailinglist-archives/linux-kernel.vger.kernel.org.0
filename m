The DTS file for AML-S905X-CC has never been renamed.

The ALL-H3-CC was only reworked to split out the common bits to accommodate
the different SoC (H3 vs H5) variants for the same board. Even after the
rework, the board DTS files retained their original naming scheme. Same
goes for the Bananapi M2+. However we have never renamed Bananapi files
to Libretech.

Since Libre Computer and Firefly both have the ROC-RK3399-PC, renaming
it is likely to cause some confusion.
