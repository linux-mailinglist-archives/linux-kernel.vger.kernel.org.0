Ugh... mobile app is sending HTML emails. Replying again.

You sent out a lot of emails on this topic. But to answer them all.
The existing implementation is 100% backwards compatible.

This is referring to an alternate implementation where implicit
dependencies are used by the kernel but new "depends-on" property
would allow overriding in cases where the implicit dependencies are
wrong. But this will need a kernel command line flag to enable this
feature so that we can be backwards compatible. Otherwise it won't be.

Current patch series doesn't really "fallback" but rather it only acts
on this new property. Existing FDT binaries simply don't have this. So
it won't have any impact on the kernel behavior. But yes, looking at
the patches again will help :)
