I bet that for tiny you won't need to rate-limit at all.  The reason
is that grace periods are quite short.

In fact, for TINY (that is, !SMP && !PREEMPT), synchronize_rcu() is a
no-op.  So in TINY, given that your ioctl is executing at process level,
you could just invoke synchronize_rcu() and then kfree():

#ifdef CONFIG_TINY_RCU
	synchronize_rcu();  /* No other CPUs, so a QS is a GP! */
	kfree(whatever);
	return; /* Or whatever control flow is appropriate. */
#endif
	/* More complicated stuff for !TINY. */
