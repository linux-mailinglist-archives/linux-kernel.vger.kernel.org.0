For more in-depth analysis of OOM events, people could use kdump to save a
vmcore by setting "panic_on_oom", and then use the crash utility to analysis the
 vmcore which contains pretty much all the information you need.

The downside of that approach is that this is probably only for enterprise use-
cases that kdump/crash may be tested properly on enterprise-level distros while
the combo is more broken for developers on consumer distros due to kdump/crash
could be affected by many kernel subsystems and have a tendency to be broken
fairly quickly where the community testing is pretty much light.
