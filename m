The effective protection of any given cgroup is a somewhat complicated
construct that depends on the ancestor's configuration, siblings'
configurations, as well as current memory utilization in all these
groups. It's done this way to satisfy hierarchical delegation
requirements while also making the configuration semantics flexible
and expressive in complex real life scenarios.

Unfortunately, all the rules and requirements are sparsely documented,
and the code is a little too clever in merging different scenarios
into a single min() expression. This makes it hard to reason about the
implementation and avoid breaking semantics when making changes to it.

This patch documents each semantic rule individually and splits out
the handling of the overcommit case from the regular case.

Michal Koutný also points out that the points of equilibrium as
described in the existing example scenarios aren't actually
accurate. Delete these examples for now to avoid confusion.

+ *    parent's effective protection.
+ *
+ * 3. To make complex and dynamic subtrees easier to configure, the
+ *    user is allowed to overcommit the declared protection at a given
+ *    level. If that is the case, the parent's effective protection is
+ *    distributed to the children in proportion to how much protection
+ *    they have declared and how much of it they are utilizing.
+ *
+ *    This makes distribution proportional, but also work-conserving:
+ *    if one cgroup claims much more protection than it uses memory,
+ *    the unused remainder is available to its siblings.
+ *
+ * 4. Conversely, when the declared protection is undercommitted at a
+ *    given level, the distribution of the larger parental protection
+ *    budget is NOT proportional. A cgroup's protection from a sibling
+ *    is capped to its own memory.min/low setting.

- * which are not using their guarantee do not affect actual memory
- * distribution.
- *
- * For example, if there are memcgs A, A/B, A/C, A/D and A/E:
- *
- *     A      A/memory.low = 2G, A/memory.current = 6G

- *            D/memory.low = 0   D/memory.current = 2G
- *            E/memory.low = 10G E/memory.current = 0
- *
- * and the memory pressure is applied, the following memory distribution
- * is expected (approximately):
- *
- *     A/memory.current = 2G
- *
- *     B/memory.current = 1.3G
- *     C/memory.current = 0.6G
- *     D/memory.current = 0
- *     E/memory.current = 0

- * These calculations require constant tracking of the actual low usages
