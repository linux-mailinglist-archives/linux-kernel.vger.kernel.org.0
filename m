The populate_vma_page_range() kerneldoc is wrong.  "return 0 on
success, negative error code on error".  Care to fix that please?

Well yes, but the testing of PageWriteback() is a hack added in
fe3cba17c49471 to permit the sharing of PG_reclaim and PG_readahead. 
If we didn't need that hack then we could avoid adding new hacks to
hack around the old hack :(.  Have you considered anything along those
lines?  Rework how we handle PG_reclaim/PG_readahead?

Really?  filemap_fault()'s

	if (!lock_page_maybe_drop_mmap(vmf, page, &fpin))
		goto out_retry;

	/* Did it get truncated? */
	if (unlikely(compound_head(page)->mapping != mapping)) {
		unlock_page(page);
		put_page(page);
		goto retry_find;
	}

should handle such cases?

I wouldn't call that "fixing" :(
