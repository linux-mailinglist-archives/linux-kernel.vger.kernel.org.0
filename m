I'm not loving it; but I see what it does and I can't quickly see an
alternative.

My main gripe is doing even more of those cgroup traversals.

One thing pick_next_task_fair() does is try and limit the cgroup
traversal to the sub-tree that contains both prev and next. Not sure
that is immediately applicable here, but it might be worth looking into.
