I don't think anyone is overfitting for a specific use case. When some
process A wants to manipulate process B's memory, it's fair for A to
want to know what memory it's manipulating. That's a general concern
that applies to a large family of cross-process memory operations.
It's less important for non-destructive hints than for some kind of
destructive operation, but the same idea applies. If there's a simple
way to solve this A-B information problem in a general way, it seems
to be that we should apply that general solution. Likewise, an API to
get an efficiently-collected snapshot of a process's address space
would be immediately useful in several very different use cases,
including debuggers, Android memory use reporting tools, and various
kinds of metric collection. Because we're talking about mechanisms
that solve several independent problems at the same time and in a
general way, it doesn't sound to me like overfitting for a particular
use case.
