Subject: [PATCH 00/33] fbcon notifier begone!

Hi all,

I fixed the fbcon_exited mess that CI spotted (hopefully it works now, the
code is still rather brittle imo). Plus all the little nits 0day and
people found.

Maarten slapped an rb onto the entire pile, but I feel like enough has
changed that a 2nd look from him is warranted.

I also added a backlight patch on top, I think that nicely highlights how
the fb notifier is now only used for backlight notifications. Maybe we
could rename it as a follow-up to make that clear.

Oh and one rather badly looking thing: am200epd is abusing the notifier in
very interesting ways. I guess a proper fix would be to figure out where
the display boot memory reservation is some more direct way, instead of
listening to the fw fb driver. But that's definitely outside of my
knowledge, so I left it at a bunch of #ifdef and comments.

I think we also still need an ack from Greg KH for the vt and staging
bits.

As usual, comments, review and testing very much welcome.

btw for future plans: I think this is tricky enough (it's old code and all
that) that we should let this soak for 2-3 kernel releases. I think the
following would be nice subsequent cleanup/fixes:

- push the console lock completely from fbmem.c to fbcon.c. I think we're
  mostly there with prep, but needs to pondering of corner cases.

- move fbcon.c from using indices for tracking fb_info (and accessing
  registered_fbs without proper locking all the time) to real fb_info
  pointers with the right amount of refcounting. Mostly motivated by the
  fun I had trying to simplify fbcon_exit().

- make sure that fbcon call lock/unlock_fb when it calls fbmem.c
  functions, and sprinkle assert_lockdep_held around in fbmem.c. This
  needs the console_lock cleanups first.

But I think that's material for maybe next year or so.

Cheers, Daniel
