I would not call this regression. It was intentional. The change in
5.2 unified the behavior for the other %p? modifiers. I simply did
not care about plain %p because it was already crippled by the hashing.

I am fine with the proposed change. But the more I think about it
the less I want to rush it in for 5.6. The proposed patch changes
the behavior again:

Value           Output v5.1       Output v5.2      Proposal

NULL                       (null) 00000000<.hash.> 0000000000000000
fffffffffffffffe 00000000<.hash.> 00000000<.hash.> fffffffffffffffe
ffffffff12345678 00000000<.hash.> 00000000<.hash.> 00000000<.hash.>

I do not want to change this in rc phase. I would really like to wait
for 5.7.

In this, case I would prefer to fix the tests properly first. There
have been only few commits in lib/test_printf.c since 5.2. And they
should not conflict with the changes proposed at
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200220125707.hbcox3xgevpezq4l@pathway.suse.cz
So it should be easy to backport as well.

If you want, I could sent the cleanup patch properly for review.

Best Regards,
Petr
