For a start, the ITS code predates the matrix allocator by about three
years. Also, my understanding of this allocator is that it allows
x86 to cope with a very small number of possible interrupt vectors
per CPU. The ITS doesn't have such issue, as:

1) the namespace is global, and not per CPU
2) the namespace is *huge*

Now, what property of the matrix allocator is the ITS code missing?
I'd be more than happy to improve it.

Thanks,

         M.
