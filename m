Yeah, I completely agree that the bridge chaining is worn out. I also agree that
letting the parent call the child would alleviate some of this. However I do
worry that relying on the driver to order the calls correctly might be too much
to ask. I think the pattern for handling this type of thing is to add bridge
helper functions that allow drivers to override the default behavior when a
tricky situation arises. This would allow us to break down the bridge midlayer
and more tightly integrate it into the atomic world.

That said, agree that it's out of scope for this project. If you like the above,
I can add a TODO item to the list in a follow-up patch.
