Hi Matthias,
thanks for the review.

I was aware of that patch, unfortunately it doesn't address the same issue.=
 In
my case I never get a second port status event (so no PLC =3D=3D 1 or any s=
tate
change seen in PLS). The device simply disconnects from the bus.

I did test both the issue and fix on top of last week's master branch.

Regards,
Nicolas
