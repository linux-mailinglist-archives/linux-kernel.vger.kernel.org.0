I didn't test it, but I think that we'll convert the first watchpoint into a
mismatch breakpoint on arm32 and then when we resume execution, we'll hit
the subsequent watchpoint and so on until we actually manage to "step" the
instruction. On arm64, we'll use hardware step directly and therefore
disable all watchpoints prior to performing the step.
