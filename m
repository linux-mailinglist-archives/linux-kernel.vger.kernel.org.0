Pray.. the TSC MSR is still writable from SMM, so BIOS monkeys could
still do what they've been doing for decades. Which is try and 'hide'
SMM latency by taking the TSC timestamp on SMM entry and writing the
timestamp back into the TSC MSR on exit.

Yes, ever since TSC_ADJUST we can better recover from it, but
we still need to first detect it went sideways and by then time has been
observed buggered and any recovery is basically too late :/

Granted, this is happening less (at least, I really do hope so).

Also, what consititutes a 'modern' CPU?

These new ones yeah, cuz they wrecked HPET in PC10 :/

But how do we know? Ever since Nehalem TSC has basically been good
hardware wise -- there's a few exception on large (>4) socket machines,
but nobody has those anyway.

It has always been the BIOS messing it up. Now, the reason I think it
has gotten better is because Windows is now also relying on TSC (like
we've been doing forever).

Maybe I'm too scarred by too much TSC wreckage over the years...
