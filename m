Normally, only the foreground console has a scrollback, so by not being 
visible it therefore has no scrollback to flush. When the scrollback is 
persistent (only vgacon implements that) then there must be a 
con_flush_scrollback method.

Yes, and every other console drivers as well.

Most likely, yes, after making sure the scrollback does correspond to 
the vc argument.

I don't know enough about the fbcon code to be sure of all the 
implications here.

Still, I'd prefer to get back to the same functional state from before 
commit a6dbe44275 with the switch method first. Can you confirm that the 
patch I propose does fix it for you?

Many console implements the cursor by changing the background color of 
the cursor position. If the switch occurs while the cursor is in its 
visible period, the rest of the code will assume that the cursor is the 
actual background color, effectively leaving the drawn cursor there 
after it moved.
