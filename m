Thanks for bringing this up.

Helen and I have been looking at this code, and we think it's possible
to move things around and add some helpers, so we can implement rootwait
behavior, without actually cluttering init/do_mounts.c.

And along the way, we might get the chance to clean-up this code even
further.
