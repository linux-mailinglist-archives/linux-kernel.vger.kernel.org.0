Let me share some insight on how it is being used:

The MHI bus sits on top of the actual physical bus like PCI-E and requires
the physical bus for doing activities like allocating I/O virtual address,
runtime PM etc... The part which gets tied to the PCI-E from MHI is called MHI
controller driver. This MHI controller driver is also the actual PCI-E driver
managing the device.

For instance, we have QCA6390 PCI-E WLAN device. For this device, there is a
ath11k PCI-E driver and the same driver also registers as a MHI controller and
acts as a MHI controller driver. This is where I referred to reusing the PCI-E
struct device. It's not that MHI bus itself is reusing the PCI-E struct device
but we need the PCI-E device pointer to do above mentioned IOVA, PM operations
in some places. One of the usage is below:

```
void *buf = dma_alloc_coherent(mhi_cntrl->dev, size, dma_handle, gfp);
```

There was some discussion about it here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/1/27/21

The MHI bus itself has the struct device and it is the child of the physical
bus (PCI-E in this case).

Now coming to your actual question of why using a custom "MHI" prefix for
dev_ APIs. I agree that if we use the struct device of MHI bus it is not at all
needed. The fact that we are using "mhi_cntrl->dev" (which points to PCI-E dev)
is what confusing and it can be avoided.

I'll change it in next iteration.

Mani
