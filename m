Eventually, sure.  But one dragon at a time.  Right now that dragon is
"what is required to get multi_cpu_stop() to work in a timely fashioon".
The "where does that code really go" dragon comes later.

Seems logical except for the fact that multi_cpu_stop() really is taking
in excess of five minutes on a regular basis.

Almost but not quite.  It is a requirement for a patch *that* *is*
*supposed* *to* *be* *a* *fix*.  If you are trying to prohibit me from
writing experimental patches, please feel free to take a long walk on
a short pier.

Thank you, this should be quite helpful.
