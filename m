yeah, I meant the bridge controller with the ID 0x1901 is on the CPU
side. And if the Nvidia GPU is on a port on the PCH side it all seems
to work just fine.

If the kernel does a D0 -> D3hot -> D0 cycle this works as well, but
the power savings are way lower, so I kind of prefer skipping D3hot
instead of D3cold. Skipping D3hot doesn't seem to make any difference
in power savings in my testing.

Yeah.. and I think those would be too many as we know of several
models with this laptops from Lenovo, Dell and HP and random other
models from random other OEMs. I think we won't ever be able to
blacklist all models if we go that way as those might be just way too
many. Also I know from some reports on bumblebee bugs (hitting the
same issue essentially) that the acpi_osi overwrite didn't help every
user.
