This whole discussion is ignoring that clk_set_duty_cycle() exists.
Maybe you can look back on the history of why the duty cycle API was
added to the clk framework to make a strong argument for the replacement
of this API with your proposal of registering to two different
frameworks instead?

Here's the first few parts of the commit text of 9fba738a53dd ("clk: add
duty cycle support"):

    Add the possibility to apply and query the clock signal duty cycle rati=
o.

    This is useful when the duty cycle of the clock signal depends on some
    other parameters controlled by the clock framework.

    For example, the duty cycle of a divider may depends on the raw divider
    setting (ratio =3D N / div) , which is controlled by the CCF. In such c=
ase,
    going through the pwm framework to control the duty cycle ratio of this
    clock would be a burden.

In the case of qcom clks, I seem to recall the frequency of the clk
depends on the duty cycle settings. The duty cycle is constrained by the
M/N values which determine the frequency of the clk after it's
pre-divided. We did some sort of bit trick to set the duty cycle to the
N value inverted or something so that we always got 50% duty cycle.
