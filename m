Understood, but given the attractive properties of headless kfree_rcu(),
it is not unreasonable to expect its usage to remain low.  In addition,
memory-pressure scenarios can be quite involved.  Finally, as Joel
pointed out offlist, the per-CPU cached structure acts as a small
portion of kfree_rcu()-specific reserved memory, so you guys have at
least partially addressed parts of my concerns already.

I am not at all a fan of using GFP_MEMALLOC because kfree_rcu()
is sufficiently low-level to be in the business of ensuring its own
forward progress.

							Thanx, Paul
