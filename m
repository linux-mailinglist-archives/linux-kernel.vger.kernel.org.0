I don't mean to switch the default. I mean adding a way to distinguish
between reviewed and intentionally unaccounted allocation and
unreviewed allocation which is unaccounted just because that's the
default. This would allow to progress incrementally, rather than redo
the same work again and again.

Interesting. But there is really no admin today, or at least nothing
should rely on one in any way. Either because of the scale (you have
thousands/millions of machines and spending human time on each of them
individually is not going to fly) and/or because there is nobody
qualified enough around (e.g. who is an admin of a median android
phone? and what does they know about tearing down namespaces and
mounts) or there is nobody interested enough (it's fun sometimes, but
not always)... but I agree that retrofitting this level of resource
control into a large existing complex system is close to impossible.

Thank a lot for bearing with me and answering my questions. I have a
better understanding of this now.
