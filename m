Yes, and this is how I understood it from the very beginning, but then
I was confused.

And this is what was not clear to me until I noticed unmap_mapping_pages()
in collapse_shmem().

Plus I was confused by the comment above down_write_trylock(mmap_sem).
To me it looks as if we _could_ do down_write(), but we do not want to
disturb the system.

But iiuc we simply can't do down_write(), exactly because handle_mm_fault()
can wait for page lock with mmap_sem held.

Great, thanks.
