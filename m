V2 ... ugh ... C doesn't do well with nested comments, so the example
has issues.  I chose to use a C++ style comment (as they are not as
verboten in Linux as they used to be).

Another option would be to put the instructions inside #if 0 ... #endif
but that seems less than ideal.

Any other ideas?

Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpu: Explain Intel model naming convention

Dave Hansen spelled out the rules in an e-mail:

 https://lkml.kernel.org/r/91eefbe4-e32b-d762-be4d-672ff915db47@intel.com

Copy those right into the <asm/intel-family.h> file to
make it easy for people to find them.
