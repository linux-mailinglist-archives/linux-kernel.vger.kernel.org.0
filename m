This doesn't sound particularly hard, just new.  Plenty of other devices
have quirks done based on the SoC they're in or the IP revision, this
would just be another of those quirks.

Set a flag based on the compatible, then base runtime decisions off
that.

Obviously the list of regulators bound on a given platform is encoded in
the device tree but you shouldn't really be relying on that to figure
out what to request in the driver - the driver should know what it's
expecting.  Bear in mind that getting regulator stuff wrong can result
in physical damage to the system so it pays to be careful and to
consider that platform integrators have a tendency to rely on things
that just happen to work but aren't a good idea or accurate
representations of the system.  It's certainly *possible* to do
something like that, the information is there, but I would not in any
way recommend doing things that way as it's likely to not be robust.

The possibility that the regulator setup may vary on other platforms
(which I'd expect TBH) does suggest that just requesting a bunch of
supply names optionally and hoping that we got all the ones that are
important on a given platform is going to lead to trouble down the line.

Steve, please fix your mail client to word wrap within paragraphs at
something substantially less than 80 columns.  Doing this makes your
messages much easier to read and reply to.
