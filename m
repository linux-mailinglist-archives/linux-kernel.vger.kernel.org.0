... it wasn't clear to me even after reading this sentence again now
:)

I understand that you may have to vote for the lowest bandwidth but
that doesn't explain why a range can't work (sorry if it was just me
who doesn't understood it :)).

If it is useless to have entire range here, then why bother providing
one ? Why can't the GPU request what it needs in exact terms, based on
its calculations ? And then based on these requests, let the
interconnect find what's the best/stable values it really wants to
program the path for (and for that the interconnect can use its own
OPP table, which would be fine).

Hmm, I am not sure GPU's algorithm needs this table AFAIU based on all
the conversations we had until now. It is very capable of finding how
much bandwidth it needs, you just want the GPU driver to finally align
that with a stable bandwidth for the platform later on. And what I am
asking is that it is not required for the end driver to look for
stable values, it just requests what it wants and let the interconnect
core/driver decide the stable values.

Very much like the clock framework, most of the user drivers just ask
for a clk value to be programmed and it is the clock driver which
keeps a table of the stable values and then aligns the requested value
to one of those.

> Also, as we add more ICC request properties, this range idea will not scale.

I am not sure about what kind of properties there can be and where
should they land. My feedback is completely based on what you have
presented in this patchset.
