Well I wondered before whether SSH key generation for cloud init or 
other automatically individualized systems could happen in the 
background. Replacing a key that would be there before it would be 
replaced. So SSH would be available *before* the key is regenerated. But 
then there are those big fast man in the middle warnings… and I have no 
clear idea to handle this in a way that would both be secure and not 
scare users off too much.

Well probably systems at some point better have good entropy very 
quickly… and that is it. (And then quantum computers may crack those 
good keys anyway in the future.)
