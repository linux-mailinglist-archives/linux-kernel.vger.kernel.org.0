drivers/soc is more about platform-level glue and SoC configuration, etc.
Specific IP blocks and drivers normally don't go into there, unless it's
a shared resource that a lot of drivers need access to.

So, for most of the small drivers around the SoC, other directories than
drivers/soc are still the best answer.
