Actually, pci_mmcfg_late_init() that's called out of acpi_init() -
that's where MCFG areas are properly sized. setup_mcfg_map() is mostly
for bus hotplug where MCFG area is discovered by evaluating _CBA method;
for cold-plugged buses it just confirms that MCFG area is already
registered because it is mandated for them to be in MCFG table at boot time.

It was a precaution against setup_mcfg_map() calls that might add new
areas that are not in MCFG table but for some reason have _CBA method.
It's obviously a "firmware is broken" scenario so I don't have strong
feelings to keep it here. Will prefer to remove in v2 if you want.
