But how do we find that out?

A compromise to me seems that we just do the PCS quirk for all Intel
devices explicitly listed in the PCI Ids based on new board_* values
as long as they have the old PCS location, and assume anything new
enough to have the new location won't need to quirk, given that it
never properly worked.  This might miss some intel devices that were
supported with the class based catchall, though.
