For example, have a single coherent system, instead of a fragile pipe
with each stage written in a different language, each having its own
idiosynchracies, each step losing something in translation.

Have a system that a normal developer can actually look at and
understand. It didn't use to be that way.

Fair enough, let's dismiss the thought of changing the ABI files. But I
never meant that would somehow be for the "purity of scripts", or that
those two would somehow be at odds here.

I'll leave it all up to Jon's discretion; I trust he'll understand my
concerns. I have no authority beyond the opinion I've voiced here
anyway.
