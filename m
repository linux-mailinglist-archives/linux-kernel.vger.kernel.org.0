Yes, but my best guess without digging into the ARM ARM is that the
underlying hardware is more flexible.  I don't think it hurts to
support the flexibility here even if the code creating the breakpoint
never creates one line that.  ...especially since it makes the arm32
and arm64 code match in this way.

Yes, this took me a while.  If you look at the original commit
fdfeff0f9e3d ("arm64: hw_breakpoint: Handle inexact watchpoint
addresses") this was clearly done on purpose though.  Specifically
note the part of the commit message:

[will: use __ffs instead of ffs - 1]

Without being an expert on the Hardware Breakpoint API, my
understanding (based on how the old arm32 code worked and how the
existing arm64 code works) is that the API accounts for the fact that
more than one watchpoint can trigger and that we should report on all
of them.

Specifically if you do:

watch 1 byte at 0x1000
watch 1 byte at 0x1003

...and then someone does a single 4-byte write at 0x1000 then both
watchpoints should trigger.  If we do a "break" here then they won't
both trigger.  Also note that the triggering happens below in the
"perf_bp_event(wp, regs)" so with your break I think you'll miss it,
no?

That being said, with my patch we still won't do exactly the right
thing that for an "imprecise" watchpoint.  Specifically if you do:

watch 1 byte at 0x1008
watch 1 byte at 0x100b
write 16 bytes at 0x1000

...then we will _only_ trigger the 0x1008 watchpoint.  ...but that's
the limitation in how the breakpoints work.  You can see this is what
happens because the imprecise stuff is outside the for loop and only
triggers when nothing else did.
