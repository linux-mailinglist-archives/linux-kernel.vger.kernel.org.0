But since messages from panic() are printed, messages are suppressed in a way
panic() can restore the setting.

Since the testcase is printed prior to execution, this panic()
tries to catch it as soon as possible if some testcase is actually
changing loglevel. As I confirmed that nobody changes console loglevel
before starting fuzzing tests, I'd like to try this patch in linux-next.

syzkaller catches it and treats as if a crash occurred.

Since we can't tell whether a WARNING: string reports a problem enough to
treat as a crash, we need to mask WARNING: string like
