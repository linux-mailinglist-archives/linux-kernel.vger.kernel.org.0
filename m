Well, my idea wasn't to get s_mutex here but earlier in the stack.
Maybe in ceph_evict_inode, protecting the call to __ceph_remove_caps.
But I didn't really looked into that yet, so I'm not really sure if
that's feasible (or even if that would fix this UAF).  I suspect that's
not possible anyway, due to the comment above __ceph_remove_cap:

  caller will not hold session s_mutex if called from destroy_inode.
