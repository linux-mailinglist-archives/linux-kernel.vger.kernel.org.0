Good point. I just tried to enable the spellchecker in the vim and now it
has worked well. Thanks. :-)=20

>=20
Kdump kernel will reuse the first 640k region because the real mode
trampoline has to work in this area. When the vmcore is dumped, the
old memory in this area may be accessed, therefore, kernel has to
copy the contents of the first 640k area to a backup region so that
kdump kernel can read the old memory from the backup area of the
first 640k area, which is done in the purgatory().

Finally, it caused the following errors.

>=20
Yes, when parsing the vmcore via crash tool, it occurs the above errors,
the crash tool gets invalid pointers.=20

OK. Thanks.

Good understanding. I will try to improve it later.
