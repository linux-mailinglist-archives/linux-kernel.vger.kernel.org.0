I don't mind if the maintainers agree too. The reason I did that way is because
it keeps the implementation of cpupri generic and self contained.

rt_task_fits_capacity() at the moment is a static function in rt.c
To use it in cpupri_find() I either need to make it public somewhere or have an

	extern bool rt_task_fits_capacity(...);

in cpupri.c. Neither of which appealed to me personally.

That wasn't merged at the end AFAICT :)

It's not my preferred style in this case if I have the choice - but I promise
to change it if I ended up having to spin another version anyway :)

Good question. This scenario and the one where uclamp values are changed while
an RT task is running are similar.

In both cases the migration will happen on the next activation/wakeup AFAICS.

I am not sure an always running rt/deadline task is something conceivable in
practice and we want to cater for. It is certainly something we can push a fix
for in the future on top of this. IMHO we're better off trying to keep the
complexity low until we have a real scenario/use case that justifies it.

As it stands when the system is overloaded or when there are more RT tasks than
big cores we're stuffed too. And there are probably more ways where we can
shoot ourselves in the foot. Using RT and deadline is hard and that's one of
their unavoidable plagues I suppose.

Thanks
