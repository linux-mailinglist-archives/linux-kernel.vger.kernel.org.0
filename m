There are a few discussions here[0]. We basically want to add more
randomness for stack canary when device just boot and not much device
randomness was added.

With newer compilers[1] there will be a per-task canary on arm64[2],
which will improve this situation, but many architectures lack a
per-task canary, unfortunately. I've also recently rearranged the RNG
initialization[3] which should also help with better entropy mixing.
But each of these are kind of band-aids against not having sufficient
initial entropy, which leaves the canary potentially exposed.

64 bytes should be enough. But depends on how much bootloader can provide.

EFI based systems can inject randomness in early boot. This is aimed
to support DT based systems to also have this feature.
