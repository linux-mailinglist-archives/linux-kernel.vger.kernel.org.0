This really should mention that most of them are false positives due to
early code intialization which cannot really cause a real lockup. AFAIR
you have also found some that really do allocate (GFP_ATOMIC) from the
console callback and those should be really fixed IMHO.

OK, this is slightly better than your previous attempts. Returing the
page without holding a reference is a quite subtle though. It should be
safe here because the page cannot go away because it is unmovable but
please add a comment that explains that the page _must not_ be used for
anything else than dumping its state.

Because it doesn't really provide any useful information from the
practice.

Is this correct? CMA pages cannot be comound? Btw. I would simply do

		pr_warn("page:%px refcount:%d mapcount:%d mapping:%px index:%#lx%s\n",
			...., page_cmap ? "CMA": "");
