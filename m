Thanks, Lakshmi.  This requires moving the code around.  Instead of
doing this on the current code base, I suggest posting a v9 version of
the entire "IMA: Deferred measurement of keys".

I suggest making the switch from spinlock to mutex, as you had it
originally, before posting v9.  The commit history will then be a lot
cleaner.

thanks,

Mimi
