It sounds like treating only user context, correct?
This part is just adding assertion, not fixing the problem which Naresh reported.

I think that sentense means "we don't want that this code makes in_nmi() to return true"
So, if the breakpoint interrupts pNMI/SError context, it is OK that in_nmi() returns true.

Good point! As far as I know, we don't use it because ftrace doesn't use printk.
But indeed, kprobes user can use printk and they have to call printk_nmi_enter()/exit(),
that must be commented in the documentation. Anyway, basically it is user's choice.

I'm not sure how it can prevent... anyway because we have to run a single-stepping for
recovery, and kprobe already check the reentered kprobes and skip user-handlers in
such case.
