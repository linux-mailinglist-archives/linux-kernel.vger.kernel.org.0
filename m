Due to the way they share some native calls with (IA32) compat, but need
slightly different wrappers to marshall registers, they have ifdeffery
like:

#ifdef CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION
#define COND_SYSCALL(name)                                              \
        cond_syscall(__x64_sys_##name);                                 \
        cond_syscall(__ia32_sys_##name)
#endif

#ifndef COND_SYSCALL
#define COND_SYSCALL(name) cond_syscall(__x64_sys_##name)
#endif

... so that they define the compat wrapper when necessary, but not otherwise.

As we don't share the native syscall table with compat tasks, we don't
need to do anything like that, and can unconditionally define the native
case once.

I'll cook that up now, atop of Sami's patch applied to arm64's
for-next/core.

Thanks,
Mark.
