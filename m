But this is an amplifier.  Not sure why the system designer would design 
cascading amplifiers.

And if that was the case wouldn't you want the output to be low so you 
don't overdrive the ext amplifier front end?

I mean I have no qualms with removing the init from the driver. I will 
send v3 tomorrow after a 24 hour review cycle.

I was considering safety in that the device is on at full blast (not 
sure why the HW is defaulted that way but it is).

But if volume is adjusted prior to playback then this is not an issue.  
But if volume is not adjusted then it plays full blast.
