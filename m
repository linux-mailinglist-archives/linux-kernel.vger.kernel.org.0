The story is like this. I found there are too many global registers in
Unisoc(former Spreadtrum) chips. Dozens of offset with dozens of modules
were needed to be specified. So I thought the dts files would seem "horrible"
with a big chunk of syscon-xxx (say more than 20 lines)

I learned from reg-names way which might look clean to hold all these mess things.
But to implement this, the users need to konw the cell-size if we add arguments to syscon node.
I thought to add cell-size into every syscon consumer node is a duplicated work and
I wanted to take advantage of of_parse_phandle_with_args.
So the bindings were created then.

You're correct. I've realized it is narraw to pass here.

This is an option for consumers all the time.
Acturally my patches are not going to replace this.
I'd like to provide another option to save people like desperate engineers in Spreadtrum :)

Whould it be better if I add syscon-cells into consumer's node?
Then I could read the cell size and use "of_parse_phandle_with_fixed_args()" instead.
This will not involve syscon node itself at all.
