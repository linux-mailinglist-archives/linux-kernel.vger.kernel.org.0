Thanks, your answer helped me. However, my suggestion is not to modify the use and management of the high atomic region,
but to calculate the exact free size of the highatomic so that fail does not occur for previously shared cases.

In __zone_water_mark_ok(...) func, if it is not atomic allocation, high atomic size is excluded.

bool __zone_watermark_ok(struct zone *z,
...
{
    ...
    if (likely(!alloc_harder)) {
        free_pages -= z->nr_reserved_highatomic;
    ...
}

However, free_page excludes the size already allocated by hiahtomic.
If highatomic block is small(Under 4GB RAM), it could be no problem.
But, the larger the memory size, the greater the chance of problems.
(Becasue highatomic size can be increased up to 1% of memory)
