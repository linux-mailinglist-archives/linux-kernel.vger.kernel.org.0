We are not judging which vessel is better (or the best) among all 
possible vessels. We are trying to enable more vessels. Every vessel has 
its pros and cons so there's *no* single best vessel.

The major benefits in terms of simplicity realize in user mode 
applications. It's always a trade-off. This vDSO API takes 10-20 more 
lines than the original one but would save hundreds or even thousands in 
user applications.

Again, I don't want to repeat everything as you can look back at the 
lengthy discussion to dig out the details.

Neither is a legacy to the other. Supporting both approaches is by 
design. Again, the goal is to enable more vessels because there's *no* 
single best vessel.

Let me update the commit message for the vDSO API and send you a patch.
