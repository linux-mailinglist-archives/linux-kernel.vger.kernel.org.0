Definitely the latter, although the volume of complaints clearly points=20
to a real problem from our experience. Reproducing locally, bisecting=20
and testing possible fixes is just now starting on our end.

I agree not all users seem affected; most affected people report success=20
by using -tcp to launch Steam, which makes it use direct TCP instead of=20
WebSockets, our current default connection method for Linux.

Thanks,
