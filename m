I tend to agree, that would make MADV_FREE behave more like a
PageReclaim page that gets tagged for immediate reclaim when writeback
completes. Immediate reclaim is in response to heavy memory pressure where
there is trouble finding clean file pages to reclaim and dirty/writeback
pages are getting artifically preserved over hot-but-clean file
pages. That is a clear inversion of the order pages should be reclaimed
and is justified.  While there *might* be a basis for reclaiming MADV_FREE
sooner rather than later, there would have to be some evidence of a Page
inversion problem where a known hot page was getting reclaimed before
MADV_FREE pages. For example, it could easily be considered a bug to free
MADV_FREE pages over a page that was last touched at boot time.

About the only real concern I could find about MADV_FREE is that it
keeps RSS artifically high relative to MADV_DONTNEED in the absense of
memory pressure. In some cases userspace provided a way of switching to
MADV_DONTNEED at startup time to determine if there is a memory leak or
just MADV_FREE keeping pages resident. They probably would have benefitted
from a counter noting the number of MADV_FREE pages in the system as
opposed to the vmstat event or some other way of distinguishing real RSS
from MADV_FREE.

However, I can't find a bug report indicating that MADV_FREE pages were
pushing hot pages out to disk (be it file-backed or anonymous).
