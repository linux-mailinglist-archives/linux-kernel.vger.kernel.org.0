I know little about objtool, but if it may be used by other
architectures, hope the following explanations don't appear to be too
off-topic:)

If foo is STB_GLOBAL or STB_WEAK, the assembler cannot fully resolve a
reference to foo in the same section, unless the assembler can assume
(the codegen tells it) the call to foo cannot be interposed by another
foo definition at runtime.

>(b) we have call foo, where foo is defined in a different section from

For -fPIC -fno-semantic-interposition, the assembly emitter can perform
the following optimization:

   void foo() {}
   void bar() { foo(); }

   .globl foo, bar
   foo:
   .Lfoo$local:
     ret
   bar:
     call foo  --> call .Lfoo$local
     ret

call foo generates an R_X86_64_PLT32. In a -shared link, it creates an
unneeded PLT entry for foo.

call .Lfoo$local generates an R_X86_64_PLT32. In a -shared link, .Lfoo$local is
non-preemptible => no PLT entry is created.

For -fno-PIC and -fPIE, the final link is expected to be -no-pie or
-pie. This optimization does not save anything, because PLT entries will
not be generated. With clang's integrated assembler, it may increase the
number of STT_SECTION symbols (because .Lfoo$local will be turned to a
STT_SECTION relative relocation), but the size increase is very small.


I want to teach clang -fPIC to use -fno-semantic-interposition by
default. (It is currently an LLVM optimization, not realized in clang.)
clang traditionally makes various -fno-semantic-interposition
assumptions and can perform interprocedural optimizations even if the
strict ELF rule disallows them.
