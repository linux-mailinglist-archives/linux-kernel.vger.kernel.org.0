This is a problem of kernel development process.

No. I'm saying that neither static hooks nor dynamic hooks can work as
expected if they count on userspace processes. Registering in advance is
irrelevant. Whether it can work without userspace processes is relevant.

Also, out-of-tree codes tend to become defunctional. We are trying to debug
problems caused by in-tree code. Breaking out-of-tree debugging code just
because in-tree code developers don't want to pay the burden of maintaining
code for debugging problems caused by in-tree code is a very bad idea.
