Sorry, I can't make any sense of this.

If a compiler optimizes this in the way you are describing then it is
seriously broken. If that happens then lots of code will just fall apart
in colourful ways.

Stop this please. I just wasted days to understand why code was
sprinkled with random rcu*enter/exit() invocations until I figured out
that the reason was exactly what you are proposing:

     Curing the symptoms

That's the worst engineering principle ever, really.

Just shutting up the tool without doing a proper analysis is a
guaranteed recipe for disaster because it is going to paper over real or
latent bugs. Read the git log history carefully to find prime examples
for this.

So no, neither shutting up just the places KCSAN complained about and
ignoring the rest nor your new proposal

is leading anywhere. It's both based on cargo cult programming and lacks
proper root cause analysis.

I'm surely not ignoring the output of KCSAN, but please understand that
any attempt to silence its output purely based on mechanical duct tape
is not going anywhere.

I wasted actually months in the past to decode a subtle wreckage which
was caused by the back then 'silence uninitilized variable warnings'
frenzy. One of these blindly applied annotations papered over a real
bug and made it horribly hard to find.

As I'm busy with other urgent nightmares right now, this has to wait
until I get some spare cycles or you come up with some proper analysis.

Thanks,
