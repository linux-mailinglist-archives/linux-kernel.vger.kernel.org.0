Alright, thanks for clarifying!

I had a vague memory about this discussion as well, thanks for giving
the pointers to it.

I think using a workqueue for scheduling a reset work with a timeout
of 5 s, as in your case.

However, as a heads up, if/when implementing support for busy
detection and adding MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY, needs to update that
timeout according to cmd->busy_timeout, which is provided by the core.

Kind regards
Uffe
