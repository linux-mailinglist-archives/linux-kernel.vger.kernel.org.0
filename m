Kprobes and ftrace are the two users (along with anything else that may 
use jump labels).

Looking at this from the CMODX perspective: the main example quoted of 
an erratic behavior is when any variant of the patched instruction 
causes an exception.

With ftrace, I think we are ok since we only ever patch a 'nop' or a 
'bl' (and the 'mflr' now), none of which should cause an exception. As 
such, the existing patch_instruction() should suffice.

However, with kprobes, we patch a 'trap' (or a branch in case of 
optprobes) on most instructions. I wonder if we should be issuing an 
'isync' on all cpus in this case. Or, even if that is sufficient or 
necessary.


Thanks,
Naveen
