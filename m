Ah, I see, Yeah that's the THP tradeoff between fragmentation and 
memory-usage. From my point of view, it's not self-evident that either 
approach is the best one, but the nice thing with the suggested code is 
that you can view it as an optional helper. For example, to avoid 
fragmentation and have a high huge-page hit ratio for 2MB pages, You'd 
either inflate the buffer object size to be 2MB aligned, which would 
affect also system memory, or you'd set the TTM memory alignment to 2MB. 
If in addition you'd like "soft" (non-evicting) alignment also for 1GB 
pages, you'd also hook up the new range manager. I figure different 
drivers would want to use different strategies.

In any case, vmwgfx would, due to its very limited VRAM size, want to 
use the "soft" alignment provided by this patch, but if you don't see 
any other drivers wanting that, I could definitely move it to vmwgfx.
