Nice!

BTW kcsan_atomic_next() is missing a stub definition in <linux/kcsan.h>
when !CONFIG_KCSAN:

https://github.com/google/ktsan/commit/a22a093a0f0d0b582c82cdbac4f133a3f61d207c#diff-19d7c475b4b92aab8ba440415ab786ec

... and I think the kcsan_{begin,end}_atomic() stubs need to be static
inline too.

It looks like this is easy enough to enable on arm64, with the only real
special case being secondary_start_kernel() which we might want to
refactor to allow some portions to be instrumented.

I pushed the trivial patches I needed to get arm64 booting to my arm64/kcsan
branch:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/linux.git arm64/kcsan

We have some interesting splats at boot time in stop_machine, which
don't seem to have been hit/fixed on x86 yet in the kcsan-with-fixes
branch, e.g.

I think the big risk here is drive-by "fixes" masking the warnings
rather than fixing the actual issue. It's easy for people to suppress a
warning with {READ,WRITE}_ONCE(), so they're liable to do that even the
resulting race isn't benign.

I don't have a clue how to prevent that, though.

I would love to see this soon!

Thanks,
Mark.
