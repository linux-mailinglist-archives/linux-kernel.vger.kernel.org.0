Looking forward to seeing them!

Fair point.  So your thought is that the RCU variant (or something
similar to it) is used in the lockless case, and that KCSAN complains
about lockless use of the non-READ_ONCE() interface?  If so, that seems
like it might work quite well.

Agreed.  It does seem like early days for laying out a reasonable set
of use cases, but we do have to start somewhere.  My hope is that the
resulting automated review of concurency will be more than worth the
effort.  Hope springs eternal and all that...  :-)
