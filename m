Greetings to you and your family.

My name is Mr. Kone Compaore, the director general with the bank,
Africa Develop bank (ADB) Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in West Africa. I
am contacting you to seek our honesty and sincere cooperation in
confidential manner to transfer the sum of 10.5 (Ten million five
hundred thousand Dollars) to your existing or new bank account.

This money belongs to one of our bank client, a Libyan oil exporter
who was working with the former Libyan government; I learn t that he
was killed by the revolutionary forces since October 2011. Our bank is
planning to transfer this entire fund into the government public
treasury as unclaimed fund if nobody comes to claim the money from our
bank after four years without account activities .

We did not know each other before, but due to the fact that the
deceased is a foreigner, the bank will welcome any claim from a
foreigner without any suspect, that is why I decided to look for
someone whim I can trust to come and claim the fund from our bank.

I will endorse your name in the deceased client file here in my office
which will indicate to that the deceased is your legal joint account
business partner or family member next of kin to the deceased and
officially the bank will transfer the fund to your bank account within
seven working days in accordance to our banking inheritance rules and
fund claim regulation.

I will share 40% for you and 60% for me after the fund is transferred
to your bank account, we need to act fast to complete this transaction
within seven days. I will come to your country to collect my share
after the fund is transferred to your bank account in your country. I
hope that you will not disappoint me after the fund is transferred to
your bank account in your country.

Please I want you to send me your private phone number so that I can
call you to discuss more details on how we can proceed on this project

Waiting for your urgent response today
Yours sincerely

Kone Compaore
