Notes:
    It should be noted that kvmalloc() and kmem_cache_destroy() lack a
    kerneldoc header, a side-effect of this change is that the :c:func:
    fallback of making them bold is lost. This is probably best fixed by
    adding a kerneldoc header to their source.

 The most straightforward way to allocate memory is to use a function

 The maximal size of a chunk that can be allocated with `kmalloc` is
 limited. The actual limit depends on the hardware and the kernel
 configuration, but it is a good practice to use `kmalloc` for objects
 smaller than page size.

-For large allocations you can use :c:func:`vmalloc` and
-:c:func:`vzalloc`, or directly request pages from the page
-allocator. The memory allocated by `vmalloc` and related functions is

 If you are not sure whether the allocation size is too large for
-`kmalloc`, it is possible to use :c:func:`kvmalloc` and its
-derivatives. It will try to allocate memory with `kmalloc` and if the
-allocation fails it will be retried with `vmalloc`. There are

 If you need to allocate many identical objects you can use the slab
-cache allocator. The cache should be set up with
-:c:func:`kmem_cache_create` or :c:func:`kmem_cache_create_usercopy`
-before it can be used. The second function should be used if a part of
-the cache might be copied to the userspace.  After the cache is
-created :c:func:`kmem_cache_alloc` and its convenience wrappers can
-allocate memory from that cache.

-When the allocated memory is no longer needed it must be freed. You
-can use :c:func:`kvfree` for the memory allocated with `kmalloc`,
