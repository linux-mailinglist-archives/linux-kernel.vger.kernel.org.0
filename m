Again I ask you to read emails carefully and not jump the gun.

This line is very important. But seems to have skipped

This is suggestion, feel free to do anything as long as that conforms to
documentation laid out, which incidentally was written by Sanyog and
signed off by you. See 89634f99a83e ("Documentation: soundwire: Add more documentation")

Sad to see this. Now am going to quote for all these, since you skipped
the line in above email.

For prepare:
"Bus implements below API for PREPARE state which needs to be called
once per stream. From ASoC DPCM framework, this stream state is linked
to .prepare() operation. Since the .trigger() operations may not
follow the .prepare(), a direct transition from
``SDW_STREAM_PREPARED`` to ``SDW_STREAM_DEPREPARED`` is allowed."

See the point about "once per stream".

On Enable:
"Bus implements below API for ENABLE state which needs to be called once per
stream. From ASoC DPCM framework, this stream state is linked to
.trigger() start operation."

See the point about "once per stream".

For Disable:
"Bus implements below API for DISABLED state which needs to be called once
per stream. From ASoC DPCM framework, this stream state is linked to
.trigger() stop operation."

See the point about "once per stream".

For deprepare:
"Bus implements below API for DEPREPARED state which needs to be called
once per stream. ALSA/ASoC do not have a concept of 'deprepare', and
the mapping from this stream state to ALSA/ASoC operation may be
implementation specific."

See the point about "once per stream".

It is extremely sad that you chose to say this and didn't even try to
read the email and recheck the documentation you have signed off.

This has nothing to do with Qcom/Linaro. If you look at git tree in
Intel you will find that the original implementation was to use these from
machine driver. I am sure of this fact as I had written that code.

I am really getting extremely annoyed at your attitude in your
conversations and accusing me. This is not nice.
My replies are based on documentation and questioning the
implementation, which is my job here. I dont care if you feel bad about
me questions. I guess you dont like that someone is questioning, but I
dont care.
