Well, a few things.

The changelog is quite poor.  It doesn't describe the problem (console
drivers allocating memory) not does it describe the solution
(deferring the dump_page() until after release of zone->lock).

So I changed it to this:

: Some console drivers can perform memory allocation at inappropriate times,
: which can result in lockdep warnings (and presumably deadlocks) if printk
: is called with zone->lock held.
: 
: By far the best fix is to reeducate those console drivers to not perform
: these allocations, but this is proving difficult.
: 
: Another but poorer approach is to call printk_deferred() when holding
: zone->lock, but memory offline will call dump_page() which needs to defer
: after the lock.
: 
: So change has_unmovable_pages() so that it no longer calls dump_page()
: itself - instead it passes the page's descripton (as a string) back to the
: caller so that in the case of a has_unmovable_pages() failure, the caller
: can call dump_page() after releasing zone->lock.
: 
: While at it, remove a similar but unnecessary debug printk() as well.

But I see a couple of other issues.

This statement appears to be unnecessary.

Also, that whole `reason' thing in has_unmovable_pages() is just there
to tell us whether it was an "unmovable page" or a "CMA page".  This
doesn't seem terribly useful to me.  Also, I expect that the
dump_page() output will permit the user to determine that it was a CMA
page anyway.  If not, we can change dump_page() to add that info.

So how about we remove that whole `reason' thing and possibly enhance
dump_page()?  The patch then becomes much simpler.
