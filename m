David, Andrew,

I'd like to recommend this patch for -stable as it likely (test
underway) solves this crash report from Steve:

[  148.796036] page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(PagePoisoned(p))

...on a non-debug kernel it just crashes.

In this case lsmem is failing when reading memory96:

openat(3, "memory96/removable", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4
fcntl(4, F_GETFL)                       = 0x8000 (flags O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)
fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0
read(4,  <unfinished ...>)              = ?
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

...which is phys_index 0x60 => memory address 0x3000000000

On this platform that lands us here:

100000000-303fffffff : System RAM
  291f000000-291fe00f70 : Kernel code
  2920000000-292051efff : Kernel rodata
  2920600000-292093b0bf : Kernel data
  29214f3000-2922dfffff : Kernel bss
3040000000-305fffffff : Reserved
3060000000-1aa5fffffff : Persistent Memory

...where the last memory block of System RAM is shared with persistent
memory. I.e. the block is only partially online which means that
page_to_nid() in is_mem_section_removable() will assert or crash for
some of the offline pages in that block.
