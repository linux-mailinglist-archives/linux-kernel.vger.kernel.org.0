interconnect probably good to get going anyways (and I need to find
some time to respin those mdp5/dpu patches) but I guess not related to
what you see (ie. I'd expect interconnect issue would trigger
underflow irq's)..

I'm not entirely sure why atomic would break things but cmd mode
panels aren't especially well tested.  I can't find it now but there
was a thread (or IRC discussion?) that intf2vblank() should be
returning MDP5_IRQ_PING_PONG_<n>_DONE instead of
MDP5_IRQ_PING_PONG_<n>_RD_PTR, which seems likely and possibly related
to vblank timing issues..
