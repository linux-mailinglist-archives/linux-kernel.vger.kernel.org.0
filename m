Right, the example makes sense.

That is assuming there are various other expected racy reads that are
fine. If that's not true, ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS should be
considered.

I can't say anything about introducing even more macros. I'd say we
need at least a dozen use-cases or more and understand them, otherwise
we may end up with the wrong API that we can never take back.

> Thoughts?

Makes sense for the cases you described.

Changing KCSAN to do this is a major change. On surface, it seems like
a refactor and exporting some existing functionality, but there are
various new corner cases, because now 2 accesses don't really have to
be concurrent anymore to detect a race (and simple properties like a
thread can't race with itself need to be taken care of). The existing
ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE macros were able to leverage existing functionality
mostly as-is. So, to motivate something like this, we need at least a
dozen or so good use-cases, where careful placement of an existing
ASSERT_EXCLUSIVE would not catch what you describe.
