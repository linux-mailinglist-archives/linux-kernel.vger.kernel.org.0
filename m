Hi Pavel,

Generally, the cover letter should state up-front what the goal is (or
what problem you're trying to solve). It would be really helpful to have
that so that we understand what you're trying to achieve, and why.

Messing with the MMU is often fraught with danger (and very painful to
debug, as you are now aware), and so far we've tried to minimize the
number of places where we have to do so.

In total this takes ~0.76s...

... and this takes ~0.35s

So do we really need this complexity for a few blinks of an eye?

Thanks,
