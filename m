I leave that decision to you :)  The user should need permission to do
an execmod thing on an enclave, however that wants to be encoded.

Enclave file -- that is, the file backing the vma from which the data is loaded.

It's provided by userspace based on whether it thinks the data in
question is enclave code.  source->vm_file is the file from which the
code is being loaded.  I'm assuming that the user code will only set
excute_intent ==true if it actually wants to execute the code, so, if
there's a denial, it will be fatal.  The normal case will be that the
request will be granted on the basis of EXECUTE.

sigstruct is just the data.  source->vm_file is the file from which
the sigstruct came, which could be a .sigstruct file or could be the
main executable or a DSO that contains an embedded enclave.  The
sigstruct data is there so that an LSM (not necessarily SELinux) could
check MRENCLAVE or MRSIGNER, and the source is there so that the
file's label can be checked.

These would occur for any mmap(), mprotect(), or ioctl() that changes
VMA permissions.  Actually arranging for the hooks to be called is an
implementation detail that might require a new .mprotect vm_operation.
As an alternative, security_enclave_init() or similar could supply
may_execmod and may_execmem flags to the driver, and the driver could
do these checks on its own when mmap() and mprotect() happen without a
new LSM callback.

I think it would set *execute_intent=false if the process lacks
EXECUTE on source->vm_file.  I'm not sure any more complexity is
required.  If the enclave has EXECMOD, then it will still work on the
basis of the mmap/mprotect rules.
