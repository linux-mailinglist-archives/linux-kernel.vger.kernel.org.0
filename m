x86 systems are very likely to have the RTC set by the bios config.
In which case it will almost certainly get set to local time.
It is certainly the default for windows installs - I don't even know
if you have any other option.

The 'real fun' (tm) happens when a dual boot system changes from
winter to summer time.
ISTR that it is quite easy to get both (or more) OS to change the
RTC by an hour (I went home an hour early one year).
Although the x86 RTC chip has a bit defined for 'summertime', nothing
sets it (at least when I looked).
