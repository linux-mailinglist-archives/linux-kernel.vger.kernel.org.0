my understanding is that:
- the PWM regulator driver is built in (=y)
- the Meson PWM controller driver is built as module (=m)
- during boot the PWM regulator node is found and it has a matching
driver (built-in)
- the PWM regulator driver tries to find the PWM controller but cannot
find it yet (and reports "Failed to get PWM: -517")
- (this repeats a few times)
- then the filesystem / initramfs is loaded where the modules are located
- now the Meson PWM controller driver is loaded
- the PWM regulator driver tries to find the PWM controller -> now it found it

this patch only silences the "Failed to get PWM: -517" message
Mark didn't apply it back then because without that message it would
be harder to debug these issues

what makes you think that there's a problem with pwm-meson?

can you please share a boot log with the command line parameter
"initcall_debug" [0]?
from Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt:
 initcall_debug [KNL] Trace initcalls as they are executed.  Useful
 for working out where the kernel is dying during
 startup.

you can also try the command line parameter "clk_ignore_unused" (it's
just a gut feeling: maybe a "critical" clock is being disabled because
it's not wired up correctly).

back when I was working out the CPU clock tree for the 32-bit SoCs I
had a bad parent clock in one of the muxes which resulted in sporadic
lockups if CPU DVFS was enabled.
you can try to disable CPU DVFS by dropping the OPP table and it's
references from the .dtsi
