this is very sad news
as far as I can tell many IP cores are similar/identical on
GRX350/GRX550, LGM and even VRX200

I already know that VRX200 is a legacy product and you won't be supporting it
once LGM support lands upstream you could add support for
GRX350/GRX550 with small to medium effort
that is a big win (in my opinion) because it means happier end-users
(see XWAY and VRX200 support in OpenWrt for example: while support
from Intel/Lantiq has died long ago these devices can still run a
recent LTS kernel and get security updates. without OpenWrt these
devices would probably end up as electronic waste)

maybe implementing a re-usable regmap clock driver (for mux, gate and
divider) means less effort (compared to converting everything to
standard clock ops) for you.
(we did the switch from standard clock ops to regmap for the Amlogic
Meson clock drivers when we discovered that there were some non-clock
registers that belong to other IP blocks in it and it was a lot of
effort)
this will allow you to add support for GRX350/GRX550 in the future if
demand for upstream drivers rises.
