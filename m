The chain below is wrong:

> printk_deferred()
>   vprintk_emit()
>     wake_up_klogd()

wake_up_klogd() calls irq_work_queue(). It queues the work for
an interrupt handler and triggers the interrupt.

The work is done in the interrupt context. The interrupt could
never be handled under zone->lock.

So, printk_deferred() would help. But I do not think that it is
really needed. I am going to answer the original mail with
all the full lockdep report.
