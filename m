/* B: this READ_ONCE() */

Hence you're claiming a data dependency from A to B. (FWIW, the LKMM
would call "A ->dep B" an "address dependency.)

This comment also claims that the "pairing MB5-write" orders "stores
of @seq and @next" (which are to different memory locations w.r.t. A
and B): I do not get why this access to @next (C above?, that's also
"unordered" w.r.t. A) can be relevant; can you elaborate?

My gmail-search foo is unable to locate MB0-read: what am I missing?
Also, can you maybe annotate the memory accesses to @id, @next, @seq
and @oldest (as I did above)? I find myself guessing their location.

Same as above but for MB6-read and the accesses to @id, @next, @seq,
@data, @data_next.

In conclusion, I have been unable to produce litmus tests by reading
your comments (meaning I'm lost).

Thanks,
