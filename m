Evading the questions, are we?

OK, I can be flexible.  Suppose that you were getting RCU CPU stall
warnings featuring multi_cpu_stop() called from cpu_stopper_thread().
Of course, this really means that some other CPU/task is holding up
multi_cpu_stop() without also blocking the current grace period.

What is the best way to work out what is really holding things up?

							Thanx, Paul
