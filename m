This maximum sounds rather arbitrary. Why do we need one? In the driver this just allocates more memory, so why not just impose no artificial limit at all?

Actually, do we need this property at all? Can't we just rely on the size of arm,func-ids to determine this (using of_property_count_elems_of_size() in the driver)? Having both sounds redundant and brings up the question what to do if they don't match.

Shouldn't there be a description on what both mean, exactly?
For instance I would expect a list of registers to be shown for the "reg" case, and be it by referring to the ARM SMCCC.

Also looking at the driver this brings up more questions:
- Which memory does mem refer to? If this is really the means of transport, it should be referenced in this *controller* node and populated by the driver. Looking at the example below and the driver code, it actually isn't used that way, instead the memory is used and controlled by the mailbox *client*.
- What is the actual difference between the two transports? For "mem" we just populate the registers with 0, for "reg" we use the data. Couldn't this be left to the client?

There are more points which makes me think this property is actually redundant, see my comments on patch 2/2.

I think this makes it obvious that arm,num-chans is not needed.

Also this somewhat contradicts the driver implementation, which allows the array to be shorter, marking this as UINT_MAX and later on using the first data item as a function identifier. This is somewhat surprising and not documented (unless I missed something).

So I would suggest:
- We drop the transports property, and always put the client provided data in the registers, according to the SMCCC. Document this here.
  A client not needing those could always puts zeros (or garbage) in there, the respective firmware would just ignore the registers.
- We drop "arm,num-chans", as this is just redundant with the length of the func-ids array.
- We don't impose an arbitrary limit on the number of channels. From the firmware point of view this is just different function IDs, from Linux' point of view just the size of the memory used. Both don't need to be limited artificially IMHO.
- We mark arm,func-ids as required, as this needs to be fixed, allocated number.

For the question of "always one channel per controller" vs. "allow multiple channels per controller": I don't really have a strong opinion, but lean towards allowing multiple channels. This would allow to group functions belonging together, separating them from totally distinct controller uses (think virtual GPIO vs. SCMI).
And it would still allow the special case of multiple single-channel controllers to be naturally specified.

According to the above description arm,func-ids would also be required?

Cheers,
Andre.
