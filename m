I'm about to get knocked offline so cannot answer properly. The code may
indeed be wrong and I have observed higher than expected NUMA scanning
behaviour than expected although not enough to cause problems. A comment
fix is fine but if you're changing the scanning behaviour, it should be
backed up with data justifying that the change both reduces the observed
scanning and that it has no adverse performance implications.
