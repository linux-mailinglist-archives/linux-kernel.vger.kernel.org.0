In LTTng, we have a "statedump" which dumps all the relevant state of
the kernel at trace start (or when the user asks for it) into the
kernel trace. It is used to collect information which helps translating
compact numeric data into human-readable information at post-processing.

For block devices, the statedump contains the mapping between the
device number and the disk name [1]. It uses the "block_class",
"disk_name", and "disk_type" symbols for this. Here is the
post-processing output:

[14:48:41.388934812] (+?.?????????) compudjdev lttng_statedump_block_device: { cpu_id = 0 }, { dev = 1048576, diskname = "ram0" }
[...]
[14:48:41.442548745] (+0.003574998) compudjdev lttng_statedump_block_device: { cpu_id = 0 }, { dev = 1048591, diskname = "ram15" }
[14:48:41.446064977] (+0.003516232) compudjdev lttng_statedump_block_device: { cpu_id = 0 }, { dev = 265289728, diskname = "vda" }
[14:48:41.449579781] (+0.003514804) compudjdev lttng_statedump_block_device: { cpu_id = 0 }, { dev = 265289729, diskname = "vda1" }
[14:48:41.453113808] (+0.003534027) compudjdev lttng_statedump_block_device: { cpu_id = 0 }, { dev = 265289744, diskname = "vdb" }
[14:48:41.456640876] (+0.003527068) compudjdev lttng_statedump_block_device: { cpu_id = 0 }, { dev = 265289745, diskname = "vdb1" }

This information is then used in our I/O analyses to show information
comprehensible to a user.

Yes, this is far from ideal. Here are the ones I observe in the kernel
sources:

block/genhd.c
40:static const struct device_type disk_type;   <---- the one we use

lib/raid6/test/test.c
41:static char disk_type(int d)  <---- this is a stand-alone user-space test program, not part of the kernel image.

crypto/async_tx/raid6test.c (depends on CONFIG_ASYNC_RAID6_TEST)
44:static char disk_type(int d, int disks) <---- the compiler optimizes away this function, so this symbol is not present in the kernel image.

I think a better approach to solve this would be to implement and expose an
iterator function in the core kernel which could invoke a callback. However,
the main issue remains: if the only user is out-of-tree, I cannot justify
adding an exported kernel helper for this.

Thanks,

Mathieu
