No, your original patch was just broken. The commit message only claimed
that

	drivers/tty/Makefile has:
        	obj-$(CONFIG_SERIAL_DEV_BUS)    += serdev/

	so in drivers/tty/serdev/Makefile CONFIG_SERIAL_DEV_BUS is
	always =y.

which is clearly false since it can be =m (as the build-bot reported).

You now suggest to change:

	obj-$(CONFIG_SERIAL_DEV_BUS)   += serdev/
	+obj-y                          += serdev/

in drivers/tty/Makefile so that make always recurse into serdev, even
when serdev is not enabled, which likewise makes no sense. And in any
case that chunk is not fixing your original patch, but introducing a
different slight regression.

Yes, I think reverting is the right thing to do here.

That's ok, I don't think that "cleanup" is something we want, and either
way it needs to be reviewed separately.
