So, I guess it is better to keep the .rst files under Documentation/devicetree,
instead of moving them to Documentation/firmware-guide.

Well, if moved, I guess it would be easy to modify the scripts that produce
the documentation to also parse something a new directory inside
Documentation/firmware-guide.

Yeah, I remember I saw something like the above in the past. However,
I'm not seeing this entry at the MAINTAINERS file at next-20200303 anymore.

Did someone removed such entry?
