Sure, the above was just an example.

No, this is not a bug. It is perfectly valid for individual sensors to have
uninitialized limits. If I recall correctly, the NVME specification
specifically states that the default settings for individual sensors
shall be those values (0 and 65535 Kelvin, specifically).

And, yes, I would agree that is a bit odd that NVME drives report temperatures
in Kelvin, but such is the world.

Again, you can set whatever limits you like. The default limits on many
hardware sensor chips have odd values. Just looking at my system:

Are you suggesting that we should not support setting min/max values for
all drivers just because they are often not initialized to reasonable values
by default ?
