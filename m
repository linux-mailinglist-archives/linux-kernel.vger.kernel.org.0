Thanks for sharing the result, very interesting!

Would you mind running a "dd write operation", to test large
consecutive writes as those should cause longer busy times. Just to
make sure the HW busy detection really works as expected.

For example:
dd of=/dev/mmcblk[n] if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=512 conv=fsync

A couple of follow up questions then.

Normally, the mmc core adds the MMC_RSP_BUSY (part of MMC_RSP_R1B)
response flag, for those commands having busy signaling on DAT0, like
CMD6 for example. After the command has been sent, the core checks
whether the host supports HW busy signaling, via the
MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY flag. If so the polling loop to detect when
the card stops signaling busy, is skipped by the core. See
__mmc_switch() and mmc_poll_for_busy(), for example.

This makes me wonder, why doesn't your driver set the
MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY, as it seems to support HW busy signaling?

Moreover, it also seems like your driver can support
MMC_CAP_DONE_COMPLETE. Or at least the part that requires HW busy
detection for I/O write operations. I guess we also need your series,
"[PATCH 0/3] Introduce the request_atomic() for the host"  as to
support it. What do you think, would it be possible to test this at
your side?

Note that, I haven't played with MMC_CAP_DONE_COMPLETE so far, but it
was invented to allow optimization for these kind of situations.

Now, don't get me wrong, I still think we should move forward with
@subject series. I just want to make sure we don't have several
methods to implement the same thing. So perhaps, MMC_CAP_DONE_COMPLETE
and the corresponding code should be removed, in favor of the more
generic hsq interface?

Thanks for testing and sharing!

Did you use "[PATCH 0/3] Introduce the request_atomic() for the host"
as well? In there, it seems like you are disabling the hsq option for
removable cards, or did I get that wrong? Does it matter?

Kind regards
