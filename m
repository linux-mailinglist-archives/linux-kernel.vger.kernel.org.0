The design of this vDSO API was NOT to minimize wrapping, but to allow 
maximal flexibility. More specifically, we strove not to restrict how 
info was exchanged between the enclave and its host process. After all, 
calling convention is compiler specific - i.e. the enclave could be 
built by a different compiler (e.g. MSVC) that doesn't share the same 
list of CSRs as the host process. Therefore, the API has been 
implemented to pass through virtually all registers except those used by 
EENTER itself. Similarly, all registers are passed back from enclave to 
the caller (or the exit handler) except those used by EEXIT. %rbp is an 
exception because the vDSO API has to anchor the stack, using either 
%rsp or %rbp. We picked %rbp to allow the enclave to allocate space on 
the stack.
