Perhaps ftrace_nop_initialize(), so that it's not a noun?

I've made it ftrace_nop_initialization() in my branch for now.

True.

I've put this immediately after ftrace_make_nop() in the header, and
given it a kerneldoc comment. There's a declaration for struct module at
the top of the header, so I've just relied on that

That looks like:

| /**
|  * ftrace_init_nop - initialize a nop call site
|  * @mod: module structure if called by module load initialization
|  * @rec: the mcount call site record
|  *
|  * This is a very sensitive operation and great care needs
|  * to be taken by the arch.  The operation should carefully
|  * read the location, check to see if what is read is indeed
|  * what we expect it to be, and then on success of the compare,
|  * it should write to the location.
|  *
|  * The code segment at @rec->ip should be as initialized by the
|  * compiler
|  *
|  * Return must be:
|  *  0 on success
|  *  -EFAULT on error reading the location
|  *  -EINVAL on a failed compare of the contents
|  *  -EPERM  on error writing to the location
|  * Any other value will be considered a failure.
|  */
| #ifndef ftrace_init_nop
| static int ftrace_init_nop(struct module *mod, struct dyn_ftrace *rec)
| {
| 	return ftrace_make_nop(mod, rec, MCOUNT_ADDR);
| }
| #endif

Thanks,
Mark.
