Given the pending addition of regulators I think this should be
structured a bit differently so that we abstract out the matching and
phandle look-up so there's a clean separation of binding specifics.
It's kind of messy with 2 patterns to parse already and if we added a
3rd? I would iterate over the properties as you do for regulators in
both cases and for each property call a binding specific match
function. The common pattern can of course be a common function. Let
me know if that makes sense. If not I can try to flesh it out some
more.
