You are claiming here that this applies to all systems I've never used
even a single one that uses it. How can you possibly back this up?  I've
been aware that SeaBIOS does use it but only now became aware that it
has been also updated to the standard. This kind of change is welcome
but lets scope things properly.

Unfortunately, also the short summary looks like pure nonsense at the
moment. What are "TCG log", "tpm2 systems" and why is TPM2 not
capitalized there?

For short summary I'd just put "tpm: Parse event log from TPM2 table"

"for TPM2 systems"

Stick with a single notation. If count correctly you use in total three
different notations for the same thing in the commit message.

crypto-agile log should be enough given the context.

Should be in the same line. You should also separate them with a single
space character, not with a new line character.

This is a more sane URL for the resource to use:

https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tcg-acpi-specification/

Remove this extra new line character.

This is a duplicate definition to struct acpi_table_tpm2 located in
include/acpi/actbl3.h. If you need to update that file, please do it
as a separate commit.

Other examples of use can be found from tpm_crb.c and tpm_tis.c.
Please skim them through.

A trailing new line.

What is start_method_params? I don't understand this comment. Please
remove and instead implement validation to all branches.

Instead "else if (buff->length == sizeof(struct acpi_tcpa)" and return
-EINVAL if neither matches.

Logically that is a distinct change so you need to turn this into
a patch set where the first patch contains only the change that
validates that the length for TCPA and return -EINVAL if not.

Did not look everything in the detail because there is still so much
groundwork to do but this will branch to use TCPA table with a TPM2
chip when the length differs from sizeof(struct acpi_tpm2).
