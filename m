What would that exactly look like?  What would it require for new
developers for when they write new entries?  Why not rely on a helper
script, that allows us to validate things better?

He who writes the script, get's to dictate the language of the script :)

Personally, this looks sane to me, I'm going to apply the ABI fixups to
my tree at least, and then see how the script works out.  The script can
always be replaced with a different one in a different language at a
later point in time of people think it really mattes.
