Ok, in looking further at this, it's both better than I thought, and
totally worse.

This interface you all are using where you ask the firmware driver for a
pointer to a set of operation functions and then make calls through that
is indicitive of an api that is NOT what we normally use in Linux at
all.

Just make the direct call to the firmware driver, no need to muck around
with tables of function pointers.  In fact, with the spectre changes,
you just made things slower than needed, and you can get back a bunch of
throughput by removing that whole middle layer.

So go do that first please, before adding any new stuff.

Now for the ioctl, yeah, that's not a "normal" pattern either.  But
right now you only have 2 "different" ioctls that you call.  So why not
just turn those 2 into real function calls as well that then makes the
"ioctl" call to the hardware?  That makes things a lot more obvious on
the kernel driver side exactly what is going on.

If you need to add more "ioctl" like calls, just add them as more
functions, no big deal.  How many more of these are you going to need
over time?

But that's not all that big of a deal right now, get rid of that whole
middle-layer first, that's more important to clean up.  You will get rid
of a lot of unneeded code and indirection that way, making it simpler
and easier to understand what exactly is happening.
