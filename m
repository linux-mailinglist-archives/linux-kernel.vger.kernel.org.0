Hi Jim

and thanks for the feedback first of all.

I have to say user-latency was a primary concern when I first started
looking into this, so that at first I had thought about exposing a
dedicated additional method to let the users register callbacks which
would have been called straight away from the RX ISR using an
atomic notification chain.

Reasoning about that, though:

- me being really nervous about letting users register something that I'm
  going to call on behalf of them in atomic context (...not bold enough I know :D)
  since can potentially be misused and cause slowdowns to the notification
  delivery or to the system as a whole

- if something like that must be allowed it must be policed somehow from the
  core....what if dozens of callbacks are allowed to be registered in this way
  instead of the blocking mode ? they will slow down each other anyway..and
  what about relative priorities amongst callbacks inside the same notification
  chain ? (potentially registered from different users)

- let's say we allow this and you can register your own atomic callback (which it would
  be policed), what you can do with that at the end ? What are the benefits of this
  scenario ? AICS there are two possible scenarios (but if you can propose more scenarios
  that I've missed you're more than welcome):

   1. you can do the smallest-amount-possible-of-work-in-irq-as-usual and defer,
      probably attaching a timestamp of arrival to the stuff you push for
      deferred processing (and this is what I'm doing already for you..even if
      with too much memcpying around probably :D....more on this later...)
OR 

   2. you can immediately signal the condition just received to an external
      processing unit...say like raising a line which will trigger an interrupt
      in those agent...and this is a scenario in which I can imagine the atomic
      notification chain can benefit (in fact that's the reason I'm still thinking
      about it as a controlled/policed alternative)...but, anyway, in this scenario,
      you are going to route as quickly as possible a critical SCMI notification to
      some external processor for immediate processing...and so you want it to be
      propagated as fast as possible...fine..but why passing through the richOS at all ?
      if it's so critical shouldn't have been already handled by the platform to the
      processing entity bypassing the richOS as a whole and all its inherent latencies ?
      (beside my own memcpys :D)
      So for this last consideration I gave up thinking about some more performant
      atomic delivery of notifications ? But if you can make a case where some sort of
      alternative quick atomic (policed) delivery makes sense, I'll be happy to think
      about it again.

Having said all of the above, I'll certainly review the memcopying to see if I can
redesign an shrink a bit their number. (the only thing that I want to avoid is placing
a spinlock into the ISR side of the dispatching...since now is all lock-free on that side
thanks to the kfifo, the 1-reader-1-writer scnario, and an additional memcpy)

In these regards what I had started to do (but no more), it was to sort of "profiling" a bit
the latency from event RX up to the point immediately before the report is delivered to the users
callbacks, and see if I can improve a bit this path in term of performance reshuffling the code.

In V3 I'm reviewing a lot notification init/exit logic (which was a bit dirty and faulty ...)
and handling of possible different platform instances (which were not handled), I'll see if I
can stick some meaningful fix about memcopies (if not it will be V4)

Moreover on this theme, given your low latencies requirements: as of now I'm using as a backend
the normal Kernel notification chains, which means though, that:

- users are in control of callbacks relative priorities, so that registering a high-pri slow one
  could waste any gain and slow-down some other user registered callbacks on the same notification
  chain (no matter if atomic or blocking)
- users (maliciously ?) could simply register a callback that return NOTIFY_STOP and to cut the chain
- users can (maliciously or not) mangle the event report fed to your callback along the way,
  so that one user can trash potentially the event seen by the next user on the same chain

Do you think the above issues are worth considering to be addressed (for performance/security issues) ?
Because in v1 I had a patch for anti-tampering (now dropped to simplify the code) that could address
all of the above, but I did not know if such policying/anti-tampering attempt was worth an valid.
(even though, I think that if I'd end up adding some emergency/critical fast support, that would need
some sort of callbacks priority policying at least)

Thanks

Regards

Cristian
