TEE based services are virtual devices which could be very well be
aware about the platform and device driver could easily query these
devices for platform specific properties. In case of firmware TPM as a
TEE based service, it could easily store the event logs generated
during PCR extend operations which could be fetched at runtime. But a
real TPM device doesn't possess that storage capability leading to
software managing these event logs.

My suggestion was to add 4th way to pass TCG logs as follows:

That's not a sane reason to avoid implementing generic stuff. As there
could be other fTPM implementations and specific DT nodes for each
which might not be maintainable. BTW, in current implementation also I
don't find DT bindings corresponding to DT node used in this
patch-set.

TEE bus framework was designed specifically to avoid OF nodes or ACPI
properties. As devices could be intelligent enough to be queried for
required properties.

> Devices enumerated by buses such as i2c can read platform specific properties.

i2c devices are real hardware which could be platform agnostic, so you
need to have platform specific properties.
