I believe so yes.

Yes, it won't be needed anymore if you are only instantiating all your devices
from your firmware interface (e.g: OF, ACPI).

As Masahiro-san mentioned, this approach will still require to add a new macro
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c_of, bar_of_match) so the OF device table is used twice.

One to expose the "of:N*T*Cfoo,bar" and another one to expose it as "i2c:bar".

I expect that many developers would miss adding this macro for new drivers that
are DT-only and so sysfs instantiation would not work there. So whatever is the
approach taken we should clearly document all this so drivers authors are aware.
