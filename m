Thanks, point taken.  While this argument is valid and it's good to
harden the PCM core side, the concurrent calls are basically a bug,
and we'd need another fix in anyway.  Also, the patch 2 makes little
sense; there can't be multiple close calls racing with each other.  So
I'll go for taking your fix but only the first patch.

Back to this race: the surfaced issue is, as you pointed out, the race
between snd_pcm_period_elapsed() vs close call.  However, the
fundamental problem is the pending action after the PCM trigger-stop
call.  Since the PCM trigger doesn't block nor wait until the hardware
actually stops the things, the driver may go to the other step even
after this "supposed-to-be-stopped" point.  In your case, it goes up
to close, and crashes.  If we had a sync-stop operation, the interrupt
handler should have finished before moving to the close stage, hence
such a race could be avoided.

It's been a long known problem, and some drivers have the own
implementation for stop-sync.  I think it's time to investigate and
start implementing the fundamental solution.


thanks,

Takashi
