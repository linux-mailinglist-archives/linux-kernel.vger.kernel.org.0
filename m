I don't want to start a bikeshedding session here, but I agree with Parth
on the interpretation of the values.

I've always read niceness values as
-20 (least nice to the system / other processes)
+19 (most nice to the system / other processes)

So following this trend I'd see for latency-nice:
-20 (least nice to latency, i.e. sacrifice latency for throughput)
+19 (most nice to latency, i.e. sacrifice throughput for latency)

However...

...just getting rid of the "-nice" would leave us free not to have to
interpret the values as "nice to / not nice to" :)

Aren't we missing the point about tweaking the sched domain scans (which
AFAIR was the original point for latency-nice)?

Something like default value is current behaviour and
- Being less latency-sensitive means increasing the scans (e.g. trending
  towards only going through the slow wakeup-path at the extreme setting)
- Being more latency-sensitive means reducing the scans (e.g. trending
  towards a fraction of the domain scanned in the fast-path at the extreme
  setting).

$> Load balance tuning
======================

Already mentioned these in [4]:

- Increase (reduce) nr_balance_failed threshold when trying to active
  balance a latency-sensitive (non-latency-sensitive) task.

- Increase (decrease) sched_migration_cost factor in task_hot() for
  latency-sensitive (non-latency-sensitive) tasks.
