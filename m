Hi Logan, Thanks for your comments. I look forward to looking for the work
you have done on ZONE_DEVICE.

The NVMe endpoint function driver that I am developing runs on a PCIe endpoint
device running Linux sitting across the PCIe bus from nvme.ko running on the
Linux host. It interacts as an NVMe endpoint across the PCIe bus with the NVMe
host. The NVMe host may be Linux, Windows, etc. In the case of Linux host, it
interacts with nvme.ko. The Linux NVMe endpoint is a Linux PCIe endpoint device
which implements a PCI Endpoint Framework function driver which implements
the NVMe endpoint functionality on Linux.
