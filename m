Ok, I can live with that, but it is a bit more complex.  However, if you
are creating a new device structure, your "core" has to do it, do not
rely on the driver to do it for you as that is just lots of duplicated
logic everywhere.  Not to mention a reference counting nightmare.

Use "struct device *parent" it's much more obvious that way and does not
look like crazy hungarian notation :)
