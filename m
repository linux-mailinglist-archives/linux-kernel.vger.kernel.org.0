I forgot to update this section.  It contains two evaluation results which has
no big difference and also describes one test in wrong way (it induced direct
IO to the ramdisk).  For example, I would like to update this section as below:

    Performance Overhead Test
    =========================
    
    This commit could incur I/O performance degradation under severe memory
    pressure because the squeezing will require more page allocations per
    I/O.  To show the overhead, I artificially made a worst-case squeezing
    situation and measured the I/O performance of a `blkfront` running
    guest.
    
    For the artificial squeezing, I set the `blkback.max_buffer_pages` using
    the `/sys/module/xen_blkback/parameters/max_buffer_pages` file.  In this
    test, I set the value to `1024` and `0`.  The `1024` is the default
    value.  Setting the value as `0` is same to a situation doing the
    squeezing always (worst-case).
    
    If the underlying block device is slow enough, the squeezing overhead could
    be hidden.  For the reason, I use a fast block device, namely the rbd[1]:
    
        # xl block-attach guest phy:/dev/ram0 xvdb w
    
    For the I/O performance measurement, I run a simple `dd` command 5 times
    directly to the device as below and collect the 'MB/s' results.
    
        $ for i in {1..5}; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xvdb \
                                 bs=4k count=$((256*512)); sync; done
    
    The results are as below.  'max_pgs' represents the value of the
    `blkback.max_buffer_pages` parameter.
    
        max_pgs   Min       Max       Median     Avg    Stddev
        0         417       423       420        419.4  2.5099801
        1024      414       425       416        417.8  4.4384682
        No difference proven at 95.0% confidence
    
    In short, even worst case squeezing on ramdisk based fast block device
    makes no visible performance degradation.  Please note that this is just a
    very simple and minimal test.  On systems using super-fast block devices
    and a special I/O workload, the results might be different.  If you have
    any doubt, test on your machine with your workload to find the optimal
    squeezing duration for you.
