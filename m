Right, but I can also see good reasons to keep going:

- In theory, CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING is the right thing to do -- the compilers
  also make some particularly bad decisions around inlining when each inline
  turns into an __always_inline, as has been the case in Linux for a long time.
  I think in most cases, we get better object code with CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING
  and in the cases where this is worse, it may be better to fix the compiler.
  The new "asm_inline"  macro should also help with that.

- The x86 folks have apparently whacked most of the moles already, see this
  commit from 2008

    x86: re-enable OPTIMIZE_INLINING

    re-enable OPTIMIZE_INLINING more widely. Jeff Dike fixed the remaining
    outstanding issue in this commit:

    | commit 4f81c5350b44bcc501ab6f8a089b16d064b4d2f6

    |     [UML] fix gcc ICEs and unresolved externs
    [...]
    |    This patch reintroduces unit-at-a-time for gcc >= 4.0,
bringing back the
    |    possibility of Uli's crash.  If that happens, we'll debug it.

    it's still default-off and thus opt-in.

- The inlining decisions of gcc and clang are already very different, and
   the bugs we are finding around that are much more common than
   the difference between CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=y/n on a
   given compiler.
