xenbus controls creation and removing of devices, so applying locking
at xenbus level is the right thing to do in order to avoid races with
device removal.

In case a backend has further synchronization requirements those have to
be handled at backend level, of course.

In the end you'll need the xenbus level locking anyway in order to avoid
a race when the last backend specific device is just being removed when
the callback is about to be called for that device. Or you'd need to
call try_get_module() before calling into each backend...
