Thanks for checking.

VMEMMAP is one of two ways to convert a PFN to the corresponding
'struct page' in SPARSE model. I mentioned them as VMEMMAP case, or
!VMEMMAP case because we called them like this previously when reviewed
patches, hope it won't cause confusion.

Currently, config ZONE_DEVICE depends on SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP. The
subsection_map is added to struct mem_section_usage to track which sub
section is present, VMEMMAP fills those bits which corresponding
sub-sections are present, while !VMEMMAP, namely classic SPARSE, fills
the whole map always.

As we know, VMEMMAP builds page table to map a cluster of 'struct page'
into the corresponding area of 'vmemmap'. Subsection hotplug can be
supported naturally, w/o any change, just map needed region related to
sub-sections on demand. For !VMEMMAP, it allocates memmap with
alloc_pages() or vmalloc, thing is a little complicated, e.g the mixed
section, boot memory occupies the starting area, later pmem hot added to
the rear part.

About !VMEMMAP which doesn't support sub-section hotplog, Dan said 
it's more because the effort and maintenance burden outweighs the
benefit. And the current 64 bit ARCHes all enable
SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP_ENABLE by default.

So no need to keep subsection_map and its handling in SPARSE|!VMEMMAP.

Only these two. Wei Yang firstly posted the patch to fix the hot add
failure in SPARSE|!VMEMMAP. When I reviewed his patch and tested, found
hot remove failed too. So the patch 1/7 is to fix the hot remove failure
in !VMEMMAP. With these two patches, hot add/remove works well in !VMEMMAP.
Not sure if it's clear.

Hmm, Dan also asked this before.

The adding mainly happens in patch 2, 3, 4, including the two newly
added function defitions, the code comments above them, and those added
dummy functions for !VMEMMAP.

Thanks
