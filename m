Just picking out individual interfaces is going to create a whack a mole
game and a boat load of config options to disable these. That's really
not the way to go.

The right thing to do is to have ONE config switch which disables all
write interfaces at once by refusing the write right in the debugfs
entry point. 

Of course there might be a few debugfs files which need write access
even in that case, but that's easy enough to fix by marking them as
explicitely allowed.

Thanks,
