Makes sense. I suppose the worst possible case is data corruption due to
copying to/from the wrong object, but the risk here seems quite low.

I'm not really concerned about it, particularly if these values are
usually generated as uuids. If we get reports that involve collisions
here, then we can revisit it then.

IMO, it's up to the admin to guarantee that the fsid is unique within a
multi-cluster environment.
