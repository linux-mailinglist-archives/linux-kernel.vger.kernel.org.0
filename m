I'm not 100% sure what you are saying.

Are you arguing that the proposed patch increases the run-time cost of
devm_clk_put() so much that the listed improvements (simpler source code,
smaller object size) are not worth it?

AFAIU, the release action is only called
- explicitly, when devm_clk_put() is called
- implicitly, when the device is removed

How often are clocks removed?

In hot code-path (called hundreds of times per second) it makes sense to
write more complex code, to shave a few cycles every iteration. But in
cold code-path, I think it's better to write short/simple code.

Regards.
