Right, that's true and looks fine as you have it. I meant I wondered if
there was a way to teach blkoops about mtd device naming (in the same
way that it already supports many ways to find matching block devices by
path, by UUID, etc). That way when blkoops see a matching MTD device,
it'll load the mtd module, etc. For now, let's leave this as-is, and
revisit this idea after v3.

How are filesystems implemented on top of MTD devices? Are they
MTD-specific, or is there a block layer driver that goes on top of MTD?

Yeah, I'm still looking through that. I'd love to be able to merge the
pstore/zone with much of ram.c. That way we could even get ECC support
on non-RAM storage devices. :)

But let's not worry about that for v3. I'd like to get our
configurations matched up, though. To that end, yes, let's keep your
"dmesg_size" (or should we maybe call this "oops_size" to distinguish
oops dmesg from console dmesg) and I will add an alias to ramoops to
support "oops_size". Then we can have a single place to configure
settings for the pstore/zone layer. I'll keep thinking about how to best
to that.

Yeah, this works, though with the "psotre" typos fixed. ;) The comments
in the Makefile aren't needed, since there's no renaming actually
happening. They're just named that from the first time they appear
upstream.

Or, based on above, "Size if Kbytes of oops log to store"?

Yeah, this has bothered me for a while but mostly only ramoops cared
(almost all the other backends only support the oops frontend :P).
I have some ideas about this, but I'm not quite ready to implement it
(basically, the backend would tell the core what it could support,
and the core would examine available frontends and then report back to
the backend what it needed). But that's not something we need for v3.
I'll keep thinking about it.

We may need to revisit this in the future in order to keep the module
loading sane: we can't have the function body get unloaded while
something holding a pointer to it is active. But this would be a small
change at a later time. Let's leave this as-is for v3.

Absolutely. :)

Ah! Right. Then it should separate "non matching" with pr_debug() and
"the matching one failed" with pr_err() (i.e. it's the right device, but
something about it is bad: bad size, can't register, etc).

Okay.
