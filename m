It is only clear for GICD, for other cases the actual behavior was
hard to find out, see below.

I screwed this up with GITS_TYPER, sorry.

I now found 8.8 The GIC Distributor register map of IHI0096C which
says "Reserved register addresses are RAZ/WI."

I don't have the version A of the spec, but does it also describe the
access behavior? I agree that version C is clear for GICD registers.
But still version C is from July 2016 and even June 2015 for the A
release is far after tapeout of that chip that was shown running at
SC2014. Please keep that in mind.

Other parts are not that clear. Mostly the spec marks such addresses
as 'Reserved' only without further note, meaning there is only the
Glossary describing access of "Reserved" registers as "UNPREDICTABLE
behavior."  (I also agree a fault is not the best we can do here, but
at least it is unpredictable :-).
