Connectors versus sysfs came up on a backlight thread recently.

Daniel Vetter wrote an excellent summary on why it has been (and still
is) difficult to migrate backlight controls towards the DRM connector
interface:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/20/752

Many of the backlight legacy problems do not apply to privacy screens
but I do suggest reading this post and some of the neighbouring parts
of the thread. In particular the ACPI driver versus real driver issues
Daniel mentioned could occur again. Hopefully not though, I mean how
wrong can a 1-bit control go? (actually no... don't answer that).

It would definitely be a shame to build up an unnecessary sysfs legacy
for privacy screens so definitely worth seeing if this can use DRM
connector properties.


Daniel.
