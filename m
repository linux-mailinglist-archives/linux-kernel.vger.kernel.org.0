Why? admin can test the probes before using it via bpf.

My point was only admin can make a dicision to allow (or delegate) the
priviledge to a user, and if it is OK, I don't mind it.
(Maybe it is better to give a knob to allow this CAP only for admin.)

I understand that the single strong CAP will useful anyway (even if
it is CAP_SYS_ADMIN). I just concern that causes any issue and when
someone wants to mitigate it, it is sad if there is only way to disable
all tracing facilities.

What about providing a sysctl to control the power of the CAP? maybe
it is also good from the viewpoint of system security.
