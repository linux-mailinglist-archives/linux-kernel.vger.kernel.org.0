The sharing is what the referenced_ptes > 1 check is for.

The problem with executables is that when they are referenced, they
get a *lot* of references compared to data pages. Think about an
instruction stream and how many of those instructions result in data
references. So when you see an executable page that is being accessed,
it's likely being accessed at a high rate. They're much hotter, and
that's why reference bits from VM_EXEC mappings carry more weight.

IMO this applies to executable file and anon equally.

I don't think that leads to desirable behavior, because it causes an
age inversion between deactivated and freshly instantiated pages.

We know the new page was referenced when it entered the head of the
inactive list. However, the old page's reference could be much, much
longer in the past. Hours ago. So when they both reach the end of the
list, we treat them as equally hot even though the new page has been
referenced very recently and the old page might be completely stale.

Keep in mind that we only deactivate in the first place because the
inactive list is struggling and we need to get rid of stale active
pages. We're in a workingset transition and *should* be giving old
pages the chance to move out quickly.

shrink_page_list() doesn't honor PageReferenced as a reference.

PG_referenced is primarily for the mark_page_accessed() state machine,
which is different from the reclaim scanner's reference tracking: for
unmapped pages we can detect accesses in realtime and don't need the
reference sampling from LRU cycle to LRU cycle. The bit carries over a
deactivation, but it doesn't prevent reclaim from freeing the page.

For mapped pages, we sample references using the LRU cycles, and
PG_referenced is otherwise unused. We repurpose it to implement
second-chance tracking of inactive pages with pte refs. It counts
inactive list cycles, not references.

Right, unmapped pages have their own reference tracking system because
they can be detected synchronously.

My questions center around this:

We have an existing sampling algorithm for the coarse-grained page
table referenced bit, where we start pages on inactive, treat
references a certain way, target a certain inactive:active ratio, use
refault information to detect workingset transitions etc. Anon used a
different system in the past, but your patch set switches it over to
the more universal model we have developed for mapped file pages.

However, you don't switch it over to this exact model we have for
mapped files, but rather a slightly modified version. And I don't
quite understand the rationale behind the individual modifications.

So let me turn it around. What would be the downsides of aging mapped
anon exactly the same way we age mapped files? Can we identify where
differences are necessary and document them?
