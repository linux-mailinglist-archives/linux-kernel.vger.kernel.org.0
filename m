Will fix this as much as possible.

BTW, does ARM support perf imc_count events which are used in CAT tests?

Is it OK to fold the basic tests into bigger tests? E.g. the filesystem and mount point
tests are actually part of CAT test and we just dump the sub-test results during CAT test.
Seems your test results show the sub-test results during CAT test.

You are right. Will generate the temp file in /tmp.

Which GCC do you use to see the issues? We use 8.2.1 and no compilation issue is reported.
