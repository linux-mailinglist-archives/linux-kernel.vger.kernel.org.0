To be clear here: the problem with the above is that ReST has zero
tolerance and actually behaves like a crash, if it receives something like:

   ==========================
   PCIe Device AER statistics
   ==========================

For it to work, it has to have zero spaces before ===..=== line, e. g.:

==========================
PCIe Device AER statistics
==========================

Ok, maybe we could try to teach the parser a way to identify the initial
spacing of the first description line and remove that amount of 
spaces/tabs for the following lines, but it may require some heuristics.

Thanks,
Mauro
