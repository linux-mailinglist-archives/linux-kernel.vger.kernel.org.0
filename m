After testing this some more, the user reports, that the situation 
actually got worse.

No the docking station additionally disconnects randomly when working 
with the system. This did not happen before. Only the Ethernet port of 
the docking station works more reliably now.

Mathias, can you confirm this behavior? Is it the same problem as before?

Paul
