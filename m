Sorry, I should have explained it in more details,

Yes.

Agreed,

Yes... but lets compare it with the current implementation. To simplify,
lets look at the "less generic" version I showed in reply to this patch:

	static u64 scale_stime(u64 stime, u64 rtime, u64 total)
	{
		u64 res = 0, div, rem;

		if (ilog2(stime) + ilog2(rtime) > 62) {
			div = div64_u64_rem(rtime, total, &rem);
			res += div * stime;
			rtime = rem;

			int shift = ilog2(stime) + ilog2(rtime) - 62;
			if (shift > 0) {
				rtime >>= shift;
				total >>= shift;
				if (!total)
					return res;
			}
		}

		return res + div64_u64(stime * rtime, total);
	}

So, if stime * rtime overflows it does div64_u64() twice while the
current version does a single div_u64() == do_div() (on 32bit).

Even a single div64_u64() is more expensive than do_div() but afaics
a) not too much and b) only if divisor == total doesn't fit in 32bit
and I think this is unlikely.

So I'd say it makes scale_stime() approximately twice more expensive
on 32bit. But hopefully fixe the problem.

But we need the arch-neutral implementation anyway, the code above
is the best I could invent.

But see below!

Oh, please, it is not that I like my solution very much, I would like
to see something more clever.

Heh. I have to admit that I didn't know that divq divides 128bit by
64bit. gcc calls the __udivti3 intrinsic in this case so I wrongly
came to conclusion this is not simple even on x86_64. Plus the fact
that linux/math64.h only has mul_u64_u64_shr()...

IIUC, the new helper above is not "safe", it generates an exception
if the result doesn't fit in 64bit. But scale_stime() can safely use
it because stime < total.

So may be we can do

	static u64 scale_stime(u64 stime, u64 rtime, u64 total)
	{
		u64 res = 0, div, rem;

		#ifdef mul_u64_u64_div_u64
		return mul_u64_u64_div_u64(stime, rtime, total);
		#endif

		if (ilog2(stime) + ilog2(rtime) > 62) {
			div = div64_u64_rem(rtime, total, &rem);
			res += div * stime;
			rtime = rem;

			int shift = ilog2(stime) + ilog2(rtime) - 62;
			if (shift > 0) {
				rtime >>= shift;
				total >>= shift;
				if (!total)
					return res;
			}
		}

		return res + div64_u64(stime * rtime, total);
	}

?

Oleg.
