Assuming arch_remove_memory() doesn't (cannot) check, is there a risk on
arm64 that, for example, one removes memory available at boot and then
kexecs a new kernel? Does the kexec tool present the new kernel with the
original memory map?

I can see x86 has CONFIG_FIRMWARE_MEMMAP suggesting that it is used by
kexec. try_remove_memory() calls firmware_map_remove() so maybe they
solve this problem differently.

Correspondingly, after an arch_add_memory(), do we want a kexec kernel
to access it? x86 seems to use the firmware_map_add_hotplug() mechanism.

Adding James as well for additional comments on kexec scenarios.

That's fine if these callers give such guarantees. I just want to make
sure someone checked all the possible scenarios for memory hot-remove.
