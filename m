Perfect, thanks for testing.

Do you have a full name I can use to give you credit in the commit
message for reporting and testing?

Yes, I think so. We've already had one related report so far, and the
blacklist mechanism should be generic enough to handle any further
devices like this.

Either way, we'll have this fixed in stable in one way or another in a
couple of weeks.

Yes, I guess that wouldn't hurt.

The device used to work mostly by chance as two interfaces aren't
allowed to claim the same endpoint. Fortunately, this would only ever be
an issue in one particular configuration of the device (when altsetting
3 of interface 1 was selected) and that may be one that was never used
on Linux.

Takashi may know more about how/if that third altsetting could ever end
up being set.
