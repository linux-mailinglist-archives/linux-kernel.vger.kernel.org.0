Attn:
This message is strictly for this mail ID owner.

My name is Curt Launer an Engineer and lives in Toronto, Canada.
When  I was working  with Australian Worldwide Exploration (AWE) Sydney, Australia my company sent me to Brega Libya during Ghaddafi time.

We did the exploration and our company was paid part before death Ghedaffi.
And then there is over invoiced sum of USD6,850,000.00 unpaid at finance company in Alexandria Egypt.

Now I want you to assume as my partner so the finance house can process the payment and transfer to your care.
Either by persoanl delivery, cash transfer or International Card Settlement system (The best).

Then you will be entitled with 45% of the total money.

Please I want your comment to this before I give out further information please.

Please be sincere and hold it to your heart without disclosing it to any person.
