Oh, right, you're hijacking the very first instruction, so you know
that the rest of the arg regs as well as rax are unused.

But I find it hard to believe that this is a particularly meaningful
optimization compared to the version that saves all the C-clobbered
registers.  Steven,

Also, Alexei, are you testing on a CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=3Dy kernel?  The
ftrace code has a somewhat nasty special case to make
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=3Dy work right, and your example trampoline does
not but arguably should have exaclty the same fixup.  For good
performance, you should be using CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER=3Dn.

Steven, with your benchmark, could you easily make your actual ftrace
hook do nothing at all and get a perf report on the result (i.e. call
the traced function in a loop a bunch of times under perf record -e
cycles or similar)?  It would be interesting to see exactly what
trampoline code you're generating and just how bad it is.  ISTM it
should be possible to squeeze very good performance out of ftrace.  I
suppose you could also have a fancier mode than just "IP" that
specifies that the caller knows exactly which registers are live and
what they are.  Then you could generate code that's exactly as good as
Alexei's.
