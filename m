I am interested in this use case, but I agree that this is a separate issue.

Luis, I saw you cc'ed me on an email with the SAT solver people and
that they are still working on this. Enrico, want me to CC you on that
and we can continue this discussion there?

I would like to see those. I would also very much like to see code
dependencies, not just kconfig dependencies, tracked in Kbuild
somehow.

I think testing is another potential use case. Admittedly, I might
want something more general, but the general idea of being able to map
a config to code is super useful for automated testing.

For example, I want to run all tests. I enable all configs,cool. But
how do I know that the desired code under test actually ran?

Another example, okay I ran my tests and some of them failed. All my
test debug information is all mixed together and there is a lot of
noise present, also I am afraid that something else not part of the
test influenced the test or code under test behavior. So I want to
rerun the failed tests and the code that they test and nothing else.

I wonder if that would work for the testing scenario? I don't think it
is unreasonable for a test owner to provide a defconfig that makes it
possible to run their test. We could then merge these together to
create a kconfig to run all desired tests. Doesn't address all the
issues I mentioned here, but it's a start.
