Hello all,

Today I'm glad to announce a new statistical analysis project called "Trends in Hardware" based on the data collected by Linux community during last 5 years on the Linux Hardware portal: https://linux-hardware.org/?view=trends

With the help of the report one can identify most popular hardware characteristics and track their change over time.

The report consists of 8 sections currently: OS properties (kernel, arch, DE, boot mode, etc.), Motherboard (model, kind, mfg year, etc.), Hard drives (model, kind, size, failures, etc.), CPU (model, microarch, etc.), Video cards (model, combinations, etc.), Monitors (model, resolution, aspect ratio, density, etc.), Network (controller, kind, usage, etc.) and Compatibility (device driver support).

In each section one can find a pie chart of most popular values and can click on any element to see detailed list of computers and hardware probes. Be careful when interpreting timeline charts, since they interfere with the overall growth of the project popularity (make attention to change in ratio, rather than growth). The project can be considered also as a powerful search engine to find Linux powered computers with interested characteristics.

Most active participants in the study currently are Ubuntu, Rosa, Mint, Endless, Fedora, Arch, Manjaro, Debian, Zorin, openSUSE, KDE neon, Clear Linux and Gentoo. For top distributions in this list one can find most accurate results. Other distributions are also involved in the survey, but with small (inaccurate) data sets yet. However, the total contribution of "small" Linux distributions in "All Linux" survey is significant.

The static version of the report is shared on the Github: https://github.com/linuxhw/Trends

Please suggest new hardware/OS characteristics to track in the project if you are interested and please participate in the study by following instructions on https://github.com/linuxhw/hw-probe.

Thanks!
