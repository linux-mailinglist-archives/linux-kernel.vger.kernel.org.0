So if we look at Boqun's patches (as posted, I haven't looked at his
github, but I'm assuming this hasn't changed with the 'Shared' state),
we'll find he'll only does either 1 backward or 1 foward search (which
is already an improvement over the current state).

His mark_lock_irq() looks like:

static int
mark_lock_irq(struct task_struct *curr, struct *held_lock *this,
		enum lock_usage_bit new_bit)
{
	int excl_bit = exclusive_bit(new_bit);

+       if (new_bit & 2) {
+               /*
+                * mark ENABLED has to look backwards -- to ensure no dependee
+                * has USED_IN state, which, again, would allow recursion
+                * deadlocks.
+                */
+               if (!check_usage_backwards(curr, this, new_bit, excl_bit))
			return 0;
+       } else {
+               /*
+                * mark USED_IN has to look forwards -- to ensure no dependency
+                * has ENABLED state, which would allow recursion deadlocks.
+                */
+               if (!check_usage_forwards(curr, this, new_bit, excl_bit))
			return 0;
	}

	return 1;
}

Where '& 2' would read '& LOCK_USAGE_DIR_MASK' in the current code.

Now, I'm thinking you're proposing to replace the backward search for
USED_IN/safe with your reachable-safe state, which, if done on his
'strong' links, should still work.

That is; I _think_ the two patch-sets are not in conceptual conflict.

Of course; I could have missed something; I've just read both patchsets
again, and it's a bit much :-)
