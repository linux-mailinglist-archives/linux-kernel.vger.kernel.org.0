Hm, is that implemented in open userspace somewhere? tbh I don't know
whether the srm is in the bitstream or somewhere else in the file
(they're all containers with lots of stuff), but the current upstream
hdcp stuff is done under the assumption that userspace still does the
decrypting (so only the lowest content protection level supported
right now). Hence the explicit step to update the kernel on the latest
srm, which the kernel can then use to either check for revokes or hand
to the hardware.
