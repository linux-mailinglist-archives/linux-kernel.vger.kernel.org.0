Hi Patricia,

Oh wow, awesome! Just what I always wanted :-)

I tried this before and failed miserably ... mostly I thought we
actually needed CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS, which doesn't work (at least I hope
my patch for it was reverted?) - do you know what's up with that?

Couple questions, if you don't mind.

Is it even possible today to compile ARCH=um on anything but x86_64? If
yes, perhaps the above should be

	select HAVE_ARCH_KASAN if X86_64

or so? I assume KASAN itself has some dependencies though, but perhaps
ARM 64-bit or POWERPC 64-bit could possibly run into this, if not X86
32-bit.

Not sure I understand this, can anything in this file even get compiled
without CONFIG_UML?

typo there - 'instrument'

but maybe UML shouldn't call panic() in such contexts, instead of this?
I've had some major trouble with calling into the kernel before things
are ready (or after we've started tearing things down), so that might be
a good thing overall anyway?

Could just do it this way and fix it later too though I guess.

I guess this can't be avoided.


Very cool, I look forward to trying this out! :-)

Thanks,
johannes
