Of course. But I meant inside the UML PTE system. We end up *unmapping*
it when loading modules, because it overlaps vmalloc space, and then we
vfree() something again, and unmap it ... because of the overlap.

And if it's *not* in the vmalloc area, then the kernel doesn't consider
it valid, and we seem to often just fault when trying to determine
whether it's valid kernel memory or not ... Though I'm not really sure I
understand the failure part of this case well yet.
