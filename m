Ok that's fine.

Interesting. That one seems like a plain access, I wonder why it does not use
READ_ONCE() in there or volatile accesses.

Ok, sorry I missed you are clearing it below in the next function. That's
fine with me.

This patch looks good to me and I am Ok with merging of these changes into
the original patch with my authorship as you mentioned. Or if you wanted to
be author, that's fine too :)

Let me know anything else needed with it, thanks!
