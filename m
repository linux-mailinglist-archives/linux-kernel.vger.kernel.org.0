Personally, I think that our definition of who can vote should be "any
member of our community", but it's not practical, right?

This process will take years, and each year I would expect us to
increase the voting pool by a significant amount. Maybe we should focus
too much on what restrictions are in affect in the current year, but
rather on trying to learn how well these restrictions worked and which
of them we can lift.
