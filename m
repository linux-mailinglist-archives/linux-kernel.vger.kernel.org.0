Ah, yeah, that makes sense.  I think.  We do assume that we know all
the MMIO and I/O port translations before enumerating devices.  It's
*conceivable* that could be changed someday since we don't actually
need the translations until a driver claims the device, and it would
gain some flexibility if we didn't have to program the host bridge
windows until we know how much space is required.  But I don't see
that happening anytime soon.
