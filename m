IIRC, we suffered endless gc loop due to there is valid block belong to an
opened atomic write file. (because we will skip directly once we hit atomic file)

For your case, I'm not sure that would happen, did you look into is_alive(), why
will it fail? block address not match? If so, it looks like summary info and
dnode block and nat entry are inconsistent.

I guess, maybe after check_valid_map(), the block is been truncated before
is_alive(). If so the victim should be prefree directly instead of being
selected again...

I think that's not a normal case, or I'm missing something.
