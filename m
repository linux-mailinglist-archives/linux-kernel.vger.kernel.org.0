hugetlbfs page faults can race with truncate and hole punch operations.
Current code in the page fault path attempts to handle this by 'backing
out' operations if we encounter the race.  One obvious omission in the
current code is removing a page newly added to the page cache.  This is
pretty straight forward to address, but there is a more subtle and
difficult issue of backing out hugetlb reservations.  To handle this
correctly, the 'reservation state' before page allocation needs to be
noted so that it can be properly backed out.  There are four distinct
possibilities for reservation state: shared/reserved, shared/no-resv,
private/reserved and private/no-resv.  Backing out a reservation may
require memory allocation which could fail so that needs to be taken
into account as well.

Instead of writing the required complicated code for this rare
occurrence, just eliminate the race.  i_mmap_rwsem is now held in read
mode for the duration of page fault processing.  Hold i_mmap_rwsem in
write mode when modifying i_size.  In this way, truncation can not
proceed when page faults are being processed.  In addition, i_size
will not change during fault processing so a single check can be made
to ensure faults are not beyond (proposed) end of file.  Faults can
still race with hole punch, but that race is handled by existing code
and the use of hugetlb_fault_mutex.

With this modification, checks for races with truncation in the page
fault path can be simplified and removed.  remove_inode_hugepages no
longer needs to take hugetlb_fault_mutex in the case of truncation.
Comments are expanded to explain reasoning behind locking.
