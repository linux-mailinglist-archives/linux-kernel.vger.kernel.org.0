In the general case, we have to assume that things already went boom 
long ago, as soon as the IOMMU itself was probed and reset. By the time 
we get to the point of binding of a client driver, also assume that the 
IOMMU is already powered off and stopping traffic because the RPM device 
links aren't in place yet and it believes itself unused.

I'm getting a little fed up of explaining that that problem is specific 
to the current behaviour of one particular IOMMU driver and trying to 
work around it anywhere other than in that driver is at best an 
unreliable hack.

For a very, very specific value of "solve"... ;)

This leaving things half-hanging is really ugly, but more than that it 
assumes that allocating a default domain in the first place isn't 
disruptive - I'm not 100% sure that's *always* the case today, and it's 
definitely likely to change in future as part of improving the current 
request_dm_for_dev() mechanism. As it happens, those proposed changes 
would not only break this idea, but make it redundant, since they're 
about forcing the default domain type to passthrough on a per-device 
basis, which leads to an equivalent end result to this patch, but in a 
cleaner and more robust manner.
