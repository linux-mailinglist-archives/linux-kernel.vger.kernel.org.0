that looks like a work-around to me? If you do a bank switch without 
anything triggered, you are most likely sending a bunch of zeroes to 
your amplifier and enabling click/pop removals somehow.

It'd be worth looking into this, maybe there's a missing digital 
mute/unmute that's not done in the right order?

yes, but prepare can be called without hw_free called first. that's why 
we updated the state machine to allow for DISABLED|DEPREPARED -> 
PREPARED transitions.

If you are referring to the errors when pm_runtime is not enabled, we 
fixed this is the series that's been out for review for 10 days now...

see '[PATCH 03/18] soundwire: bus: add PM/no-PM versions of read/write 
functions', that should remove the need for dummy functions.
