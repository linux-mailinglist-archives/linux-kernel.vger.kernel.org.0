Which is wrong from the day 1.

The uuid_t type is being provided by libuuid in the user space, there is no
(more) kernel exported equivalent. Same should be done to the uuid_le.

We already discussed this couple of years ago.

I guess you misunderstood the point. The types are for kernel use and keeping them
exported in a condition like it's now (quoter baked due to drop of uuid_be part
completely and uuid_le partially) is wrong.

There is *no* ABI change. And basically libuuid or another one should provide
type and infrastructure for this.

If you would like to bear the legacy type, why not to move this UUID UAPI parts
directly to MEI?
