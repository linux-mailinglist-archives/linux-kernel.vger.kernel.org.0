So the term "inherit" is the problem. The protocol is officially called
PI which is short for Priority Inheritance. Other documentation,
RT-mutex for instance, is also using this term when it is referring to
altering the priority of a task. For that reason I prefer to keep using
this term.

What about

any better?
