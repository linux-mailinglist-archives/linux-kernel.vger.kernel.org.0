Hi John

I can test any patches given a link to the diff, and am happy to do so.

If I've understood your suggestion correctly, I will try commenting
out all of the entries, then add them back one-by-one until I get a
non-booting situation. I'll let you know how I get on.

The OS I'm testing is LibreELEC, which is a custom x86_64 build, and
this hasn't shown any problems on this Skylake i5 NUC in all the years
I've been using it as a test system (since at least 4.15.y). So far
5.3-rc has been trouble-free until 5.3-rc5. As I mentioned in the bug,
I've been able to boot 5.3-rc5 from a USB memory stick, but can't boot
5.3-rc5 from the internal M2 drive unless I revert this commit.

Regards
Neil
