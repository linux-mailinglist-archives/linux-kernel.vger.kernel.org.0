I agree with you that we should keep the capability and avoid possible
performance regression on some setups. But, instead of hard-coding this
in the iommu driver, I prefer a more scalable way.

For example, the concept of per group default domain type [1] seems to
be a good choice. The kernel could be statically compiled as by-default
"pass through" or "translate everything". The per group default domain
type API could then be used by the privileged user to tweak some of the
groups for better performance, either by 1) bypassing iommu translation
for the trusted super-speed devices, or 2) applying iommu translation to
access the system memory which is beyond the device's address capability
(without the necessary of using bounce buffer).
