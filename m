That's not always possible as ACPI and DT work in different ways. The
DT (Open Firmware) USB binding originated in 1998[1]. While ancient,
that is what defines the node structure of USB hubs, ports, and
devices that we use today.

However, after a quick read of ACPI sec 9.14, I'd say what I suggested
is more aligned to ACPI than what's proposed here. Ports are child
nodes ("Device" in ACPI terms) and the properties to determine all
this are properties of the port node(s). Aligning beyond that isn't
really possible. ACPI has a standard thing (not sure what the proper
term is) called '_PLD' for describing device location which includes
'user visible' among several other things. There is no such concept in
DT to align with. What we have is the 'non-removable' property and IMO
that's what we should use here.
