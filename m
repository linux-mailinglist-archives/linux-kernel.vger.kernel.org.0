Hi Peter,

Sorry about the late reply. Had a change to look into this again today.

Could you post lsusb -v output for this with a couple of UARTs enabled?

Do you have a datasheet for the device?

I think I'm starting to get an idea of how this work, but I really don't
like having to spend this much time on detective work just to understand
how the hw works.

So you tie a ports DTR pin, even though it's normally an output, and use
that at boot to determine whether the UART should be enabled or not?

And the GPIO device can only control a pin if the corresponding port is
disabled?

Can you read back the enable state of each port?

What about devices using a different tranceiver? Should the state of the
mode pins ultimately be tied to VID/PID (can your customers change
VID/PID)?
