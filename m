Because Auto-CTS mechanism will alternate between two or more CTS values
every frame, thus it will compensate non-rational clock relationship.

Specification recommends many contradictory things without explicit
prioritization, at least I have not found it.

So we should relay on our intuition.

I guess that with auto-cts N we should follow recommendation - I guess
most sinks have been better tested with recommended values.

So what with non-auto-cts case:

1. How many devices do not have auto-cts? how many alternative TMDS
clocks we have? Maybe it is theoretical problem.

2. Alternating CTS in software is possible, but quite
complicated/annoying, but at least it will follow recommendation :)
