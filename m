Ok, sounds fine.

It's not about obscurity. min_t() is an indicator that we have to coerce
type for comparison with casting. It's nice to avoid casts if possible
and use native types for the comparison.  assignment. It's good that you
aren't using min() with a cast though, so this look fine to me and I'm
not going to stay worried about this.

I'm not strong on it so up to you.
