Are there the usual lockdep checks in the upcall code?  Holding a spinlock
across them would seem to be at least as bad as holding an rcu_read_lock()
across them.

Interrrupt -> NMI -> certain types of tracing.  I believe that can get
it to 5.  There might be even more elaborate sequences of events.
