+===================
+Setting up NFS/RDMA
+===================
+
+:Author:
+  NetApp and Open Grid Computing (May 29, 2008)
+
+
+Overview
+========
+
+This document describes how to install and setup the Linux NFS/RDMA client
+and server software.
+
+The NFS/RDMA client was first included in Linux 2.6.24. The NFS/RDMA server
+was first included in the following release, Linux 2.6.25.
+
+In our testing, we have obtained excellent performance results (full 10Gbit
+wire bandwidth at minimal client CPU) under many workloads. The code passes
+the full Connectathon test suite and operates over both Infiniband and iWARP
+RDMA adapters.
+
+Getting Help
+============
+
+If you get stuck, you can ask questions on the
+nfs-rdma-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.
+
+Installation
+============
+
+These instructions are a step by step guide to building a machine for
+use with NFS/RDMA.
+
+- Install an RDMA device
+
+  Any device supported by the drivers in drivers/infiniband/hw is acceptable.
+
+  Testing has been performed using several Mellanox-based IB cards, the
+  Ammasso AMS1100 iWARP adapter, and the Chelsio cxgb3 iWARP adapter.
+
+- Install a Linux distribution and tools
+
+  The first kernel release to contain both the NFS/RDMA client and server was
+  Linux 2.6.25  Therefore, a distribution compatible with this and subsequent
+  Linux kernel release should be installed.
+
+  The procedures described in this document have been tested with
+  distributions from Red Hat's Fedora Project (http://fedora.redhat.com/).
+
+- Install nfs-utils-1.1.2 or greater on the client
+
+  An NFS/RDMA mount point can be obtained by using the mount.nfs command in
+  nfs-utils-1.1.2 or greater (nfs-utils-1.1.1 was the first nfs-utils
+  version with support for NFS/RDMA mounts, but for various reasons we
+  recommend using nfs-utils-1.1.2 or greater). To see which version of
+  mount.nfs you are using, type:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ /sbin/mount.nfs -V
+
+  If the version is less than 1.1.2 or the command does not exist,
+  you should install the latest version of nfs-utils.
+
+  Download the latest package from: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/nfs
+
+  Uncompress the package and follow the installation instructions.
+
+  If you will not need the idmapper and gssd executables (you do not need
+  these to create an NFS/RDMA enabled mount command), the installation
+  process can be simplified by disabling these features when running
+  configure:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ ./configure --disable-gss --disable-nfsv4
+
+  To build nfs-utils you will need the tcp_wrappers package installed. For
+  more information on this see the package's README and INSTALL files.
+
+  After building the nfs-utils package, there will be a mount.nfs binary in
+  the utils/mount directory. This binary can be used to initiate NFS v2, v3,
+  or v4 mounts. To initiate a v4 mount, the binary must be called
+  mount.nfs4.  The standard technique is to create a symlink called
+  mount.nfs4 to mount.nfs.
+
+  This mount.nfs binary should be installed at /sbin/mount.nfs as follows:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ sudo cp utils/mount/mount.nfs /sbin/mount.nfs
+
+  In this location, mount.nfs will be invoked automatically for NFS mounts
+  by the system mount command.
+
+    .. note::
+      mount.nfs and therefore nfs-utils-1.1.2 or greater is only needed
+      on the NFS client machine. You do not need this specific version of
+      nfs-utils on the server. Furthermore, only the mount.nfs command from
+      nfs-utils-1.1.2 is needed on the client.
+
+- Install a Linux kernel with NFS/RDMA
+
+  The NFS/RDMA client and server are both included in the mainline Linux
+  kernel version 2.6.25 and later. This and other versions of the Linux
+  kernel can be found at: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
+
+  Download the sources and place them in an appropriate location.
+
+- Configure the RDMA stack
+
+  Make sure your kernel configuration has RDMA support enabled. Under
+  Device Drivers -> InfiniBand support, update the kernel configuration
+  to enable InfiniBand support [NOTE: the option name is misleading. Enabling
+  InfiniBand support is required for all RDMA devices (IB, iWARP, etc.)].
+
+  Enable the appropriate IB HCA support (mlx4, mthca, ehca, ipath, etc.) or
+  iWARP adapter support (amso, cxgb3, etc.).
+
+  If you are using InfiniBand, be sure to enable IP-over-InfiniBand support.
+
+- Configure the NFS client and server
+
+  Your kernel configuration must also have NFS file system support and/or
+  NFS server support enabled. These and other NFS related configuration
+  options can be found under File Systems -> Network File Systems.
+
+- Build, install, reboot
+
+  The NFS/RDMA code will be enabled automatically if NFS and RDMA
+  are turned on. The NFS/RDMA client and server are configured via the hidden
+  SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA config option that depends on SUNRPC and INFINIBAND. The
+  value of SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA will be:
+
+    #. N if either SUNRPC or INFINIBAND are N, in this case the NFS/RDMA client
+       and server will not be built
+
+    #. M if both SUNRPC and INFINIBAND are on (M or Y) and at least one is M,
+       in this case the NFS/RDMA client and server will be built as modules
+
+    #. Y if both SUNRPC and INFINIBAND are Y, in this case the NFS/RDMA client
+       and server will be built into the kernel
+
+  Therefore, if you have followed the steps above and turned no NFS and RDMA,
+  the NFS/RDMA client and server will be built.
+
+  Build a new kernel, install it, boot it.
+
+Check RDMA and NFS Setup
+========================
+
+Before configuring the NFS/RDMA software, it is a good idea to test
+your new kernel to ensure that the kernel is working correctly.
+In particular, it is a good idea to verify that the RDMA stack
+is functioning as expected and standard NFS over TCP/IP and/or UDP/IP
+is working properly.
+
+- Check RDMA Setup
+
+  If you built the RDMA components as modules, load them at
+  this time. For example, if you are using a Mellanox Tavor/Sinai/Arbel
+  card:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ modprobe ib_mthca
+    $ modprobe ib_ipoib
+
+  If you are using InfiniBand, make sure there is a Subnet Manager (SM)
+  running on the network. If your IB switch has an embedded SM, you can
+  use it. Otherwise, you will need to run an SM, such as OpenSM, on one
+  of your end nodes.
+
+  If an SM is running on your network, you should see the following:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ cat /sys/class/infiniband/driverX/ports/1/state
+    4: ACTIVE
+
+  where driverX is mthca0, ipath5, ehca3, etc.
+
+  To further test the InfiniBand software stack, use IPoIB (this
+  assumes you have two IB hosts named host1 and host2):
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    host1$ ip link set dev ib0 up
+    host1$ ip address add dev ib0 a.b.c.x
+    host2$ ip link set dev ib0 up
+    host2$ ip address add dev ib0 a.b.c.y
+    host1$ ping a.b.c.y
+    host2$ ping a.b.c.x
+
+  For other device types, follow the appropriate procedures.
+
+- Check NFS Setup
+
+  For the NFS components enabled above (client and/or server),
+  test their functionality over standard Ethernet using TCP/IP or UDP/IP.
+
+NFS/RDMA Setup
+==============
+
+We recommend that you use two machines, one to act as the client and
+one to act as the server.
+
+One time configuration:
+-----------------------
+
+- On the server system, configure the /etc/exports file and start the NFS/RDMA server.
+
+  Exports entries with the following formats have been tested::
+
+  /vol0   192.168.0.47(fsid=0,rw,async,insecure,no_root_squash)
+  /vol0   192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(fsid=0,rw,async,insecure,no_root_squash)
+
+  The IP address(es) is(are) the client's IPoIB address for an InfiniBand
+  HCA or the client's iWARP address(es) for an RNIC.
+
+  .. note::
+    The "insecure" option must be used because the NFS/RDMA client does
+    not use a reserved port.
+
+Each time a machine boots:
+--------------------------
+
+- Load and configure the RDMA drivers
+
+  For InfiniBand using a Mellanox adapter:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ modprobe ib_mthca
+    $ modprobe ib_ipoib
+    $ ip li set dev ib0 up
+    $ ip addr add dev ib0 a.b.c.d
+
+  .. note::
+    Please use unique addresses for the client and server!
+
+- Start the NFS server
+
+  If the NFS/RDMA server was built as a module (CONFIG_SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA=m in
+  kernel config), load the RDMA transport module:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ modprobe svcrdma
+
+  Regardless of how the server was built (module or built-in), start the
+  server:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ /etc/init.d/nfs start
+
+  or
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ service nfs start
+
+  Instruct the server to listen on the RDMA transport:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ echo rdma 20049 > /proc/fs/nfsd/portlist
+
+- On the client system
+
+  If the NFS/RDMA client was built as a module (CONFIG_SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA=m in
+  kernel config), load the RDMA client module:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ modprobe xprtrdma.ko
+
+  Regardless of how the client was built (module or built-in), use this
+  command to mount the NFS/RDMA server:
+
+  .. code-block:: sh
+
+    $ mount -o rdma,port=20049 <IPoIB-server-name-or-address>:/<export> /mnt
+
+  To verify that the mount is using RDMA, run "cat /proc/mounts" and check
+  the "proto" field for the given mount.
+
+  Congratulations! You're using NFS/RDMA!

-       and server will be built into the kernel
-
-    Therefore, if you have followed the steps above and turned no NFS and RDMA,
-    the NFS/RDMA client and server will be built.
-
-    Build a new kernel, install it, boot it.
-
-Check RDMA and NFS Setup
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-    Before configuring the NFS/RDMA software, it is a good idea to test
-    your new kernel to ensure that the kernel is working correctly.
-    In particular, it is a good idea to verify that the RDMA stack
-    is functioning as expected and standard NFS over TCP/IP and/or UDP/IP
-    is working properly.
-
-  - Check RDMA Setup
-
-    If you built the RDMA components as modules, load them at
-    this time. For example, if you are using a Mellanox Tavor/Sinai/Arbel
-    card:
-
-    $ modprobe ib_mthca
-    $ modprobe ib_ipoib
-
-    If you are using InfiniBand, make sure there is a Subnet Manager (SM)
-    running on the network. If your IB switch has an embedded SM, you can
-    use it. Otherwise, you will need to run an SM, such as OpenSM, on one
-    of your end nodes.
-
-    If an SM is running on your network, you should see the following:
-
-    $ cat /sys/class/infiniband/driverX/ports/1/state
-    4: ACTIVE
-
-    where driverX is mthca0, ipath5, ehca3, etc.
-
-    To further test the InfiniBand software stack, use IPoIB (this
-    assumes you have two IB hosts named host1 and host2):
-
-    host1$ ip link set dev ib0 up
-    host1$ ip address add dev ib0 a.b.c.x
-    host2$ ip link set dev ib0 up
-    host2$ ip address add dev ib0 a.b.c.y
-    host1$ ping a.b.c.y
-    host2$ ping a.b.c.x
-
-    For other device types, follow the appropriate procedures.
-
-  - Check NFS Setup
-
-    For the NFS components enabled above (client and/or server),
-    test their functionality over standard Ethernet using TCP/IP or UDP/IP.
-
-NFS/RDMA Setup
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-  We recommend that you use two machines, one to act as the client and
-  one to act as the server.
-
-  One time configuration:
-
-  - On the server system, configure the /etc/exports file and
-    start the NFS/RDMA server.
-
-    Exports entries with the following formats have been tested:
-
-    /vol0   192.168.0.47(fsid=0,rw,async,insecure,no_root_squash)
-    /vol0   192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0(fsid=0,rw,async,insecure,no_root_squash)
-
-    The IP address(es) is(are) the client's IPoIB address for an InfiniBand
-    HCA or the client's iWARP address(es) for an RNIC.
-
-    NOTE: The "insecure" option must be used because the NFS/RDMA client does
-    not use a reserved port.
-
- Each time a machine boots:
-
-  - Load and configure the RDMA drivers
-
-    For InfiniBand using a Mellanox adapter:
-
-    $ modprobe ib_mthca
-    $ modprobe ib_ipoib
-    $ ip li set dev ib0 up
-    $ ip addr add dev ib0 a.b.c.d
-
-    NOTE: use unique addresses for the client and server
-
-  - Start the NFS server
-
-    If the NFS/RDMA server was built as a module (CONFIG_SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA=m in
-    kernel config), load the RDMA transport module:
-
-    $ modprobe svcrdma
-
-    Regardless of how the server was built (module or built-in), start the
-    server:
-
-    $ /etc/init.d/nfs start
-
-    or
-
-    $ service nfs start
-
-    Instruct the server to listen on the RDMA transport:
-
-    $ echo rdma 20049 > /proc/fs/nfsd/portlist
-
-  - On the client system
-
-    If the NFS/RDMA client was built as a module (CONFIG_SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA=m in
-    kernel config), load the RDMA client module:
-
-    $ modprobe xprtrdma.ko
-
-    Regardless of how the client was built (module or built-in), use this
-    command to mount the NFS/RDMA server:
-
-    $ mount -o rdma,port=20049 <IPoIB-server-name-or-address>:/<export> /mnt
-
-    To verify that the mount is using RDMA, run "cat /proc/mounts" and check
-    the "proto" field for the given mount.
-
-  Congratulations! You're using NFS/RDMA!
