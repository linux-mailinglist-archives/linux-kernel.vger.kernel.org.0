Subject: [PATCH] sched, fair: Allow a small degree of load imbalance between
 SD_NUMA domains

The CPU load balancer balances between different domains to spread load
and strives to have equal balance everywhere. Communicating tasks can
migrate so they are topologically close to each other but these decisions
are independent. On a lightly loaded NUMA machine, two communicating tasks
pulled together at wakeup time can be pushed apart by the load balancer.
In isolation, the load balancer decision is fine but it ignores the tasks
data locality and the wakeup/LB paths continually conflict. NUMA balancing
is also a factor but it also simply conflicts with the load balancer.

This patch allows a degree of imbalance to exist between NUMA domains
based on the imbalance_pct defined by the scheduler domain to take into
account that data locality is also important. This slight imbalance is
allowed until the scheduler domain reaches almost 50% utilisation at which
point other factors like HT utilisation and memory bandwidth come into
play. While not commented upon in the code, the cutoff is important for
memory-bound parallelised non-communicating workloads that do not fully
utilise the entire machine. This is not necessarily the best universal
cut-off point but it appeared appropriate for a variety of workloads
and machines.

The most obvious impact is on netperf TCP_STREAM -- two simple
communicating tasks with some softirq offloaded depending on the
transmission rate.

Fairly small impact on average performance but note how much the standard
deviation is reduced showing much more stable results. A clearer story
is visible from the NUMA Balancing stats

Without the patch, only 55.75% of sampled accesses are local.
With the patch, 100% of sampled accesses are local. A 2-socket
Broadwell showed better results on average but are not presented
for brevity. The patch holds up for 4-socket boxes as well

and 100% local accesses with the patch. Similarly, the patch holds up
for 2-socket machines with multiple L3 caches such as the AMD Epyc 2

For amusement purposes, here are two graphs showing CPU utilisation on
the 2-socket Haswell machine over time based on mpstat with the ordering
of the CPUs based on topology.

The lines on the left match up CPUs that are HT siblings or on the same
node. The machine has only one L3 cache per NUMA node or that would also
be shown.  It should be very clear from the images that the baseline
kernel spread the load with lighter utilisation across nodes while the
patched kernel had heavy utilisation of fewer CPUs on one node.

Hackbench generally shows good results across machines with some
differences depending on whether threads or sockets are used as well as
pipes or sockets.  This is the *worst* result from the 2-socket Haswell
machine

An earlier prototype of the patch showed major regressions for NAS C-class
when running with only half of the available CPUs -- 20-30% performance
hits were measured at the time. With this version of the patch, the impact
is marginal

There is some impact but there is a degree of variability and the ones
showing impact are mainly workloads that are mostly parallelised
and communicate infrequently between tests. It's a corner case where
the workload benefits heavily from spreading wide and early which is
not common. This is intended to illustrate the worst case measured.

In general, the patch simply seeks to avoid unnecessarily cross-node
migrations when a machine is lightly loaded but shows benefits for other
workloads. While tests are still running, so far it seems to benefit
light-utilisation smaller workloads on large machines and does not appear
to do any harm to larger or parallelised workloads.
