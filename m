ima_update_policy() is called from multiple places.  Initially, it is
called before a custom policy has been loaded.  The call to
ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement() needs to be moved to within 
the test, otherwise it runs the risk of dropping "key" measurements.

All the queued keys need to be processed at the same time.  Afterwards
the queue should be deleted.  Unfortunately, the current queue locking
assumes ima_process_queued_keys_for_measurement() is called multiple
times.

Perhaps using the RCU method of walking lists would help.  I need to
think about it some more.

Mimi
