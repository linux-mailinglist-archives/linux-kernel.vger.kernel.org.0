I do like the cleanliness of being able to easily identify the old
buffer (AKA by putting it first) and I agree that the existing code
was only really guaranteeing 4-byte alignment and if we truly needed
more alignment then we'd be allocating a lot more bounce buffers
(which is pretty expensive).

...but the argument in commit 56406e017a88 ("usb: dwc2: Fix DMA
alignment to start at allocated boundary") is still a compelling one.
Maybe at least put a comment in the code next to the "#define
DWC2_USB_DMA_ALIGN" saying that we think that this is enough alignment
for anyone using dwc2's built-in DMA logic?

Sorry for such a mess and thank you for all the work tracking down and
documenting all the problems.  Clearly deep understanding of DMA is
not something I can claim.  :(

A few points of order first:
* Although get_maintainer doesn't identify him, it has seemed like
Felipe Balbi lands most of the dwc2 things.  Probably a good idea to
CC him.
* I have historically found Stefan Wahren interested in dwc2 fixes and
willing to test them on Raspberry Pi w/ various peripherals.
* Since one of the commits you refer to was written by Martin Schiller
it probably wouldn't hurt to CC him.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding things, but it feels like we need something
more here.  Specifically I'm worried about the fact when the transfer
buffer is already aligned but the length is not a multiple of the
endpoint's maximum transfer size.  You need to handle that, right?
AKA something like this (untested):

/* Simple case of not having to allocate a bounce buffer */
if (urb->num_sgs || urb->sg || urb->transfer_buffer_length == 0 ||
    (urb->transfer_flags & URB_NO_TRANSFER_DMA_MAP))
  return 0;

/* Can also avoid bounce buffer if alignment and size are good */
maxp = usb_endpoint_maxp(&ep->desc);
if (maxp == urb->transfer_buffer_length &&

    !((uintptr_t)urb->transfer_buffer & (DWC2_USB_DMA_ALIGN - 1)))
  return 0;


Other than that this looks good to me.
