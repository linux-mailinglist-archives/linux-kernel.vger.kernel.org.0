I take it the next patch answered your question: Activating a page
inside a cgroup has an effect on how it's reclaimed relative to pages
in sibling cgroups. So the influence part isn't new with this change -
it's about recognizing that an activation has an effect on a wider
scope than just the local cgroup, and considering that scope when
making the decision whether to activate or not.

Nice catch! Indeed, the page is charged and locked at this point, so
we don't have to do another lookup and refcounting dance here.

Subject: [PATCH] mm: vmscan: detect file thrashing at the reclaim root fix

Shakeel points out that the page is locked and already charged by the
time we call workingset_refault(). Instead of doing another cgroup
lookup and reference from current->mm we can simply use page_memcg().
