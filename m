What I was trying to say is we just can't tell if we should be looking
in the current node or the parent. 'dma-ranges' in a leaf node can be
correct or incorrect.

Your example is a bit different. I'm not sure that case is valid or
can ever work if it is. It's certainly valid that a PCI bridge's
parent has dma-ranges and now we'll actually handle any translation.
The bridge itself is not a DMA-capable device, but just passing thru
DMA. Do we ever need to know the parent's dma-ranges in that case? Or
to put it another way, is looking at anything other than leaf
dma-ranges useful?
