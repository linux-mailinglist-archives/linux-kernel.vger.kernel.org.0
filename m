I didn't even stop to think that using the value of a comparison
operator/bool in arithmetic might be the littlest bit surprising for C
programmers. But your suggestion isn't terrible, so go ahead and write
it that way. And can I get you to fix the missing "-" in the MIPS
"EDQUOT" special case while you're at it?

I know.

I thought about it and decided not to care, as long as the errptr test
comes after the hashing test, because if the hashing is not initialized
then one gets a warning. I also considered setting a flag in that case
and then skipping the errptr hash test, but again, decided that the
warning would be enough.

Sure, that will repeat the warning, but it doesn't seem to prevent a
false positive: Between plain_hash_to_buffer emitting the warning (and
returning 0) and the caller test_hashed() then performing the test()
against the buffer contents, the hash can become initialized and thus
change how %p[e] gets formatted. But ok, perhaps it is cleaner to reuse
test_hashed and avoid the local buffer in errptr. So yeah, I suppose
this on top is fine:

I prefer you to fold in both changes instead of an extra patch, and if
you can't, I'll send a new revision.
