Thanks for your review.

In addition to that, only USB2 devices that enable LPM will slow down  
shutdown process.
Right now only internally connected USB2 devices enable LPM, so the numbers  
are even lower.

IMO this is not necessary. Only xHCI that reports hw_lpm_support will be  
affected. At least for PC, this only became true after Whiskey Lake.
