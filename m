I'm not sure what projects you're talking about, so it's hard to compare.

During the 5.2 merge window, Linus did 209 pulls, bringing in just over
12,000 changesets, from on the order of 1600 developers.  Even if, at the
beginning of the window, each of those pulls was set up to be a
fast-forward, they would no longer be positioned that way once the first
pull was done.

Are you really saying that subsystem maintainers should be continuously
rebasing their trees to avoid merges at the top level?  Do you see how
much work that would take, how badly it would obscure the development
history, and how many bugs it would introduce?  Or perhaps I misunderstood
what you're arguing for?

Thanks,

jon
