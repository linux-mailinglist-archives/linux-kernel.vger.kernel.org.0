Yes, we can create a whitelist table with known models and correct SMM
commands.

No. I have not tested that my patch on other models. You can look at
that my patch link, some people already reported that on some models it
does not work...

What is incompatible with Secure Boot? sys_iopl nor sys_ioperm has
nothing to do with UEFI Secure Boot. They are just ordinary syscalls
like any other and are executed on kernel side. And IIRC it is up to the
kernel how it set privileges for I/O ports. Maybe bootloaders under
Secure Boot can set some other default values, but kernel can overwrite
them. I really do not see reason why it could be incompatible with UEFI
Secure Boot nor why it should not work. It just looks like improper
setup from userspace.

It makes sense to have implemented in kernel switching between automatic
and manual mode as kernel has API for it. But it depends on the fact
that we know which SMM API to call. And currently it is just some random
call which we somehow observed that is working on 2 machines and on some
more other does not. Until we have fully working implementation we
cannot put it into kernel.

What does not make sense for me is to have that "protection" in kernel.
