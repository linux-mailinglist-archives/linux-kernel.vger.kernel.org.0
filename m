Hrmm LNBBCLK1 doesn't make any sense to me. That's a buffer that is
technically the net connected to the XO pin on the Soc, but it isn't
really supposed to be used by anything from what I recall. Last time I
tried to use the buffers the RPM team told me I was using the wrong
resource and I should just use the XO resource instead. Doesn't RPMh
expose the other "XO" resource that is supposed to prevent XO shutdown?
Just mark it critical for now so that XO isn't turned off at runtime.

Does the serial driver probe eventually? Maybe you can run agetty when
the device appears based on some uevent for /dev/console. Or we have a
bug where /dev/console is created by devtmpfs when there isn't actually
a console?

Sure, some sort of approach that switches it later on is fine, just want
to make sure that the board clk frequency is accurately reflected in the
DT.
