Not actually.

It makes sense, "A speculative tuning knobs do more harm than good".

Then, it would be better to leave jiffies_till_{first,next}_fqs tunnable
but jiffies_till_sched_qs until we need it.

However,

(1) In case that jiffies_till_sched_qs is tunnable:

	We might need all of jiffies_till_{first,next}_qs,
	jiffies_till_sched_qs and jiffies_to_sched_qs because
	jiffies_to_sched_qs can be affected by any of them. So we
	should be able to read each value at any time.

(2) In case that jiffies_till_sched_qs is not tunnable:

	I think we don't have to keep the jiffies_till_sched_qs any
	longer since that's only for setting jiffies_to_sched_qs at
	*booting time*, which can be done with jiffies_to_sched_qs too.
	It's meaningless to keep all of tree variables.

The simpler and less knobs that we really need we have, the better.

what do you think about it?

In the following patch, I (1) removed jiffies_till_sched_qs and then
(2) renamed jiffies_*to*_sched_qs to jiffies_*till*_sched_qs because I
think jiffies_till_sched_qs is a much better name for the purpose. I
will resend it with a commit msg after knowing your opinion on it.

Thanks,
Byungchul
