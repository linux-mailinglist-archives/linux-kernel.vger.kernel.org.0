Since it's refcount based, my concern is about the side-effect of
incrementing or decrementing that reference count without WRITE_ONCE
which would lead to a transient corrupted value observed by _another_
active tracing user.

For you use-case, it would lead to a missing comm when you are actively
tracing what you want to trace, caused by another user of that refcount
incrementing or decrementing it.

I agree with you that missing tracing data at the beginning or end of a
trace is not important.

Hence my request for additional guidance on the usefulness of WRITE_ONCE(),
whether it's mainly there for documentation purposes, or if we should consider
that it takes care of real-life problems introduced by compiler optimizations
in the wild. The LWN article seems to imply that it's not just a theoretical
issue, but I'll have to let the article authors justify their conclusions,
because I have limited time to investigate this myself.

kernel/trace/trace.c:tracing_record_taskinfo_sched_switch()
kernel/trace/trace.c:tracing_record_taskinfo()

where @flags is used to control a few branches. I don't think any of those
would end up causing corruption if the flags is re-fetched between two
branches, but it seems rather fragile.

Thanks,

Mathieu
