Ah, there's that. That's still somewhat a work/discussion in progress
thing. Let me discuss it with tglx.

> To answer your question about checking any cache: this seems to be

I meant the CPUID on any CPU and thus any cache - i.e., all L3s on the
system should be inclusive and identical in that respect. Can't work
otherwise, I'd strongly presume.

Hmm, so why are you enforcing the inclusivity now:

+       if (p->r->cache_level == 3 &&
+           !get_cache_inclusive(plr->cpu, p->r->cache_level)) {
+               rdt_last_cmd_puts("L3 cache not inclusive\n");

but then will remove this requirement in the future? Why are we even
looking at cache inclusivity then and not make pseudo-locking work
regardless of that cache property?

Because if we're going to go and model this cache inclusivity property
properly in struct cpuinfo_x86 or struct cacheinfo or wherever, and do
that for all cache levels because apparently we're going to need that;
but then later it turns out we won't need it after all, why are we even
bothering?

Or am I missing some aspect?

Thx.
