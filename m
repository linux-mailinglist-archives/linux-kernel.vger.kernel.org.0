Not in the modern kernel resource manager world: anyone who is in the
tpm group can access the tpmrm device and we haven't added a dangerous
command filter like we promised we would, so unless they have actually
set lockout or platform authorization, they'll find they can execute it

Well, if it isn't TPM2_Clear would refuse to execute as well since that
requires either lockout auth or platform + physical presence.
