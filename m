Few questions. I do not see onlining code to take care of this special
case. What should happen when offline && online?
Should we allow to try_remove_memory to succeed with these pages?
Do we really have hook into __put_page? Why do we even care about the
reference count of those pages? Wouldn't it be just more consistent to
elevate the reference count (I guess this is what you suggest in the
last paragraph) and the virtio driver would return that page to the
buddy by regular put_page. This is also related to the above question
about the physical memory remove.

Do we really need to distinguish offline and hwpoison pages? They are
both unmovable for allocator purposes and offlineable for the hotplug,
right? Should we just hide them behind a helper and use it rather than
an explicit SKIP_$FOO?
