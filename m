I don't know if the maintainers will notice your email, but I did. I
don't guarantee that they'll notice or help you, but this should assist
you in writing a proper question.
You need to include the output of uname -a on both ubuntu boxes. The
output of:
dpkg -l xsensors
dpkg -l lm-sensors

The information on which processor you own and the motherboard and
it's BIOS version just in case.

This is just my understanding and it might be wrong, but the CPU is
probably accessed to do the request to the fan values and so it ramps up
expecting to have to deal with a more intense workload (which is exactly
what Ryzen and several newer Intel processors are supposed to do), and so
you're seeing expected behavior.
I've no idea how you'd change this.
Alternatively, and this is just a theory, you could have some program on
the system changing the behavior of the CPU just after you change it to
what you want it to be. As in, inotify is involved.

You're welcome,
David
