From what I recall I tested that DMA on omap3 worked fine with runtime
PM for console. Certainly there are issues still remaining though.

If you want to disable dma for a specific port, just delete the
add /delete-property/dma-names for the port in question in your
board specific dts file.

See 8250_omap.c for of_property_count_strings(np, "dma-names").
