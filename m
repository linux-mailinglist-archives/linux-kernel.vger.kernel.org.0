Ah, now I get it, I missed the point about not having DAIs for the 
amplifier.

I will second Charles' point, the code you have in the machine driver at 
[1] gets a SoundWire stream context from the SLIMbus codec dai. It's a 
bit odd to mix layers this way.


And if I look at the code below, taken from [1], if you have more than 
one codec, then your code looks problematic: data->sruntime would be 
overriden and you'd use the info from the last codec dai on the dailink...

case SLIMBUS_0_RX...SLIMBUS_6_TX:
   for (i = 0 ; i < dai_link->num_codecs; i++) {
     [snip]
     data->sruntime[cpu_dai->id] =
	snd_soc_dai_get_sdw_stream(rtd->codec_dais[i], 0); << same destination 
for multiple codec_dais...

If you keep the amp dai-less, then the stream concept should be somehow 
allocated on the master (or machine) side and passed to the codec dais 
that are associated to the same 'stream'.
