This could also work, but would add even more complexity.  I already find
the __copy_file_range implementation way to complex (and the fact that I
keep adding bugs to it is a good indicator :-) ), although I know the
performance improvements provided by the parallel requests can be huge.
Anyway, let me (try to!) fix these other bugs that Ilya keeps finding and
then I'll revisit the whole thing.
