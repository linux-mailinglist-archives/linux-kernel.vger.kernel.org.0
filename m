Sure, but unless you can limit that number to strictly zero, then 
presumably the firmware must have the general capability to verify, 
modify, and re-sign a DTB. At that point having it also tweak the status 
of nodes that it wants for itself doesn't seem like a particularly big ask.

And like I'm sure I said before, the interface between Linux and the 
Secure environment to ultimately achieve that will almost certainly make 
inspecting a passive status bit in a register redundant anyway.

In the interest of being productive, though, there is another way of 
looking at this. If we drop the pretence that it's in any way generic or 
ever going to be relevant beyond certain configurations of certain 
STMicro SoCs, then in plain terms it's just some block of MMIO registers 
that have *something* to do with various other devices. At that point, 
the answer is just to treat it as a syscon and make the relevant drivers 
for those SoCs aware of it. I'm most familiar with the "General Register 
File" on Rockchip SoCs as a prime example of "bunch of registers that 
relate to the integration of various IP blocks", which manages to be 
supported just fine without invasive hooks in the driver core.

Robin.
