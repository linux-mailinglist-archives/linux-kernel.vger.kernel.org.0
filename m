The current gem prime helpers handle this reasonable well,
I don't see a need for that.

More useful would be some way to signal this self-reimport capability
to userspace somehow.  See DRM_PRIME_CAP_LOCAL patch.

Right now I have the choice to set DRM_PRIME_CAP_{IMPORT,EXPORT}, in
which case some userspace assumes it can do cross-driver export/import
and trips over that not working.  Or I do not set
DRM_PRIME_CAP_{IMPORT,EXPORT}, which breaks DRI3 ...

export is implemented for virgl, and import should be possible too.

qxl/bochs is simliar to vmgfx, it could be done but dma-bufs would
basically be bounce buffers (need copy from/to vram) so probably not
worth the effort.

cheers,
