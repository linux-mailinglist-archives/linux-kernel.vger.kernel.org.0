I don=E2=80=99t love this approach.  Application authors seem likely to use
read() instead of mmap(), and it=E2=80=99ll still work in many cares. It wo=
uld
also complicate the kernel implementation, and looking at the inode
backing the vma that backs a pointer is at least rather unusual.
Instead, if the sigstruct isn=E2=80=99t on disk because it=E2=80=99s dynami=
c or came
from a network, the application can put it in a memfd.

I disagree.  If you deny a program EXECMOD, it=E2=80=99s not because you
distrust the program. It=E2=80=99s because you want to enforce good securit=
y
practices.  (Or you=E2=80=99re Apple and want to disallow third-party JITs.=
)
A policy that accepts any sigstruct but requires that enclaves come
from disk and respect W^X seems entirely reasonable.

I think that blocking EXECMOD has likely served two very real security
purposes. It helps force application and library developers to write
and compile their code in a way that doesn=E2=80=99t rely on dangerous tric=
ks
like putting executable trampolines on the stack.  It also makes it
essentially impossible for an exploit to run actual downloaded machine
code =E2=80=94 if there is no way to run code that isn=E2=80=99t appropriat=
ely
labeled, then attackers are more limited in what they can do.

I don=E2=80=99t think that SGX should become an exception to either of thes=
e.
Code should not have an excuse to use WX memory just because it=E2=80=99s i=
n
an enclave. Similarly, an exploit should not be able to run an
attacker-supplied enclave as a way around a policy that would
otherwise prevent downloaded code from running.
