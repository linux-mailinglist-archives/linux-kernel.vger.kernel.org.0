U-Boot only unlocks entire flash in case of Atmel or SST or Intel.

Hmm, looks like before commit 3e0930f109e7 ("mtd: spi-nor: Rework the
disabling of block write protection") global unlock was being done only
for Atmel, SST and Intel flashes. So 3e0930f109e7 definitely changes
this behavior to unlock all flashes that have SPI_NOR_HAS_LOCK set (in
addition to Atmel,SST and Intel).
I think we should just revert to the behavior before 3e0930f109e7 so as
not to break userspace expectation of preserving non volatile BP setting
across boots

Are we sure there are no Atmel and SST flashes that have non-volatile BP
bits? If so, then I have no objection for this patch as this effectively
reverts back to behavior before 3e0930f109e7.
