Well, we could, instead, add some code that would be checking python and pip
versions, but still distros could be doing some backports with could
cause side-effects. So, checking for distro versions as done in this patch
seems a lot safer.

Yeah, I asked for a more fine-tuned version.

Depending on python/pip version, adding a -p python3 seems to cause
troubles (at least I found some bug reports about that). I may be
wrong (it was a long time ago), but, before adding the logic that checks
for "python3" I guess I tried first add -p python3, but, back then,
I found some troubles (probably with some old Fedora version).

So, better to use this syntax only on distros we know it will
work as expected.

Since when we added this script, we didn't have any troubles yet with
the part of the code with checks the distribution version. So, I guess
that the lsb-release related checks are pretty much reliable.
