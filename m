I worked with low-jitter on Linux, here earlier, and tested Available Sourc=
e, and found it to be of high quality, giving 172/3 frames with the jitter =
sensitive 3-pass Doom 3 engine, from ID Software,then at 1080p res, some ye=
ars ago, a good test for the fastest bus in the system, and giving a good g=
eneral idea of potential system performance.

The Available Source Unix derivative Linux, turned out better than Microsof=
t Windows, that ofcourse without working priorities, one needs to turn off =
tasks instead, and even with this, needed double CPU speed for similar perf=
ormance.

As for multiple cpus, understanding low jitter as the time it takes to do t=
he inner loop, one cpu seems enough for most, with todays speeds of 4GHZ. M=
ore becomes a bit of a luxury on desktops but could be used for parallel th=
reads ofcourse. While phones will use minimal power technology, and big ser=
vers many-cpus for serving the masses.

I also happened to see discussions in GNU space where "GNU has failed, it i=
s not happened on the desktop". But indeed BSD has, with OSX. So it is not =
anything like that Available Source in general has failed, but indeed seems=
 to be of higher quality than closed alternatives, and the netbased discuss=
ions of much faster dynamics, than regular phonesupport indeed.

Furthermore it seems Available Source is general seems to grow, and a one-s=
ystem topology seems viable, but it needs to fuse with existing commercial =
principles, and workunion principles of Fair Labour, that indeed is establi=
shed by law, and thus should also be part of the inner loop, of a low-jitte=
r system, then probably a BSD Unix derivative.

This research was part of a greater research project on monotheism, that al=
so addresses the behaviour problems we see online, and further concludes th=
at a z=C3=A9n-concept of the divine, that works in our culture, and a Quran=
ic upgrade to the Bible is neccesary, perfecting the Abrahamic background o=
f a computer system.

And indeed the internet is already much a technocracy, where relevance is f=
iltered in specialist workgroups, with leaders taking this to mainleader, j=
ust as information needs to be handled to be handlable in a system aswell. =
Where one indeed needs results, and irrelevance goes out, being even more d=
emocratic than democracy.

So optimal information handling is low-jitter is technocratic, and an optim=
al OS, and I suggest this being Oase aswell.

Peace Go With Thee.
