yeah, you should try to avoid ONESHOT :-)

which function returns error code?

you should mask all interrupts from your device, otherwise you top-halt
may still end up reentrant.

why would you miss them? They would be left in the register until you
unmask them and the line is raised again.

why not? Masking means that new events won't cause the IRQ line to be
asserted (or MSI DWORD write won't be initiated), but the event itself
should still be in the register.

and what happens when you unmask the registers? Do they get reported?

how much is the impact? What's the impact? Why does this impact performance?

I guess you missed the point a little. Since you reenable interrupts
just to free the buffer, you end up creating the possibility for a race
condition. Specially since you don't mask all interrupt events. The
moment you reenable interrupts, one of your not-unmasked interrupt
sources could trigger, then top-half gets scheduled which tries to wake
up the IRQ thread again and things go boom.

right, it should be aligned on PAGE_SIZE

and what was the alignment on that? IIRC, ARM had the same alignment
requirements as x86. Where you sing SLUB allocator on that NXP board,
perhaps?
