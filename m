I understand the problem and noinline_for_stack improved some
paths definitely.

On the other hand, the call instruction uses the stack as well.
Note that many of the annotated functions have 5 parameters.

I believe that some of the annotated functions might get inlined
with a lower stack usage in the caller than what is needed
by the call.

The problem is that it depends on the used compiler, optimization,
and architecture. I personally do not want to invest much time
into optimizing this unless people report real life problems.
