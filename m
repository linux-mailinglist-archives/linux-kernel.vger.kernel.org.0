This tag should come at the bottom of the changelog (close to your
Signed-off-by).

I'd slightly rephrase the text here so that it is more easily readable and
correct some grammar mistakes. Something like:

If the journal is dirty when the filesystem is mounted, jbd2 will replay
the journal but the journal superblock will not be updated by
journal_reset() because JBD2_ABORT flag is still set (it was set in
journal_init_common()). This is problematic because when a new transaction
is then committed, it will be recorded in block 1 (journal->j_tail was set
to 1 in journal_reset()). If unclean shutdown happens again before the
journal superblock is updated, the new recorded transaction will not be
replayed during the next mount (because of stale sb->s_start and
sb->s_sequence values) which can lead to filesystem corruption.

Otherwise the patch looks good to me so feel free to add:

Reviewed-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

(again this is added to the bottom of the changelog like the 'Fixes' tag or
'Signed-off-by' tag).
