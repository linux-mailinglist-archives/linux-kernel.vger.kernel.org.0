Different use-cases have different needs; SysRq is targeted at a different
audience; see below.

Yes, this selection part is quite clumsy. In defense of it, one could
argue that we already have the whole n_tty implemented in kernel-space.

One way we could get rid of this is to display a summarized statistic
for the whole pgrp: pgid, oldest real time, cumulative utime and stime,
cumulative memory usage. Would this be more acceptable? Are there any
other ideas?

SysRq is intended for the person either administrating the system to be use=
d in
emergency (e.g. f for the oom kill, the famous s-u-b combo also comes to
mind) or debugging the kernel, and it indeed does a much better job for
those purposes.  In both use-cases mentioned the person has access to
the system console, where the sysrq button handlers produce all their
output, if any, and to either a physical keyboard / serial console or to
/proc/sysrq-trigger, whose mode is 0200 (writable by uid 0 only).

The use-case for this is different: the ^T-line as proposed by this
patch is for the user that interacts with a system through a terminal, who
wants to be informed not about the whole system (sort of what SysRq-t
tells you), but about what they run on that particular tty.
This is much less about "why does my system/kernel seem to hang?" or
exposing low-level internals (registers, hrtimers, locks, ...), and more
about "is my SSH terminal session unresponsive?" and "I ran a command,
it doesn't finish, how's it doing?".
e.g. A user might want to know if their SSH connection is alive without
interrupting anything, while having no access both to SysRq and console,
and no one in fg pgrp actually handles SIGINFO.

SysRq is system-wide, whereas this is per-terminal and only cares about
one tty which the status char is pressed at and its foreground pgrp
(most likely it's the foreground shell job).

I hope this is clear enough.
