Hello.

I suggested a Fair Trade BSD derivative, integrating online currency, for t=
hose with netjob skills.

Meaning finely presented file news, where content creators can upload their=
 media, set attributes for re-use and not, and get royalites automatically,=
 and everyone potentially could be part of this, and be content creators.

With a well indexed file directory for all files published:

:UMMX/Category/Subcategory/Country/13.000 km2 zone/Person/Groupings

(Here one really sees inner-loop optimization for all=C2=A0network flow cle=
arly, ridding oneself of buffer bloat and latency)

With pop statistics pr. folder, file title, with commentary option, neatly =
presented. Device Root can point to other connected devices aswell. UA01 fo=
r audio device for instance.

Now also with "Cider Factor" attribute -high,med,low.
I think then all files should go where they should, making the best of the =
internet economy, for cider enthusiast to muslim. Which also really solves =
the nuisance of the uneconomic "acid" god quite well, by replacing it with =
cider as much as possible. Fixing behaviour problems aswell. While The arab=
ic Al-Ghod is perfectly fine with me.

Supporting 4K (8K subpixel precise), small form factor, 24bit audio, low-ji=
tter I/O (180uS max OS jitter).

Peace.
