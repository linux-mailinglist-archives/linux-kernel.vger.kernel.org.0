It is actually true. But you need to make the distinction between a tracepoint
and a trace event first. What Valentin is talking about here is the *bare*
tracepoint without any event associated with them like the one I added to the
scheduler recently. These ones are not accessible via eBPF, unless something
has changed since I last tried.

The current infrastructure needs to be expanded to allow eBPF to attach these
bare tracepoints. Something similar to what I have in [1] is needed - but
instead of creating a new macro it needs to expand the current macro. [2] might
give full context of when I was trying to come up with alternatives to using
trace events.
