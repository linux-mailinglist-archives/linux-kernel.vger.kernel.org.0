But for this, it really doesn't matter. The READ_ONCE() is for going
from 0->1 or 1->0 any other change is the same as 1.

When we enable trace events, we start recording the tasks comms such
that we can possibly map them to the pids. When we disable trace
events, we stop recording the comms so that we don't overwrite the
cache when not needed. Note, if more than the max cache of tasks are
recorded during a session, we are likely to miss comms anyway.

Thinking about this more, the READ_ONCE() and WRTIE_ONCE() are not even
needed, because this is just a best effort anyway.

The only real fix was to move the check into the mutex protect area,
because that can cause a real bug if there was a race.

 {
-	bool sched_register = (!sched_cmdline_ref && !sched_tgid_ref);
+	bool sched_register;
+
 	mutex_lock(&sched_register_mutex);
+	sched_register = (!sched_cmdline_ref && !sched_tgid_ref);

Thus, I'd like to see a v2 of this patch without the READ_ONCE() or
WRITE_ONCE() added.
