OK, so as long as all arches use stop_machine to bring down a CPU then
preeempt_disable will stop racing with CPUs going offline (I don't know
if they all do or not).

So the only remaining issue is if callers pass offline CPUs to the
function (I guess there is still the chance of a race between calling
on_each_cpu_cond_mask and entering the preempt disabled'd bit). As you
suggest they probably don't.

Given the above, should we add a " @mask: The mask of cpus it can run on."
to on_each_cpu_cond_mask? (Which is different to the wording of other
functions in the same file that mask it with online CPUs, e.g.
" @mask: The set of cpus to run on (only runs on online subset).".

(I haven't seen any WARN, but from looking at the code thought that it
was possible.)

Thanks,

Andrew Murray
