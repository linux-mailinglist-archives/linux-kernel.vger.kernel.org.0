Does the TLB invalidation code have anything in it
to prevent from racing with the CPU offline code?

In other words, could we end up with the TLB
invalidation code building its bitmask, getting
interrupted (eg. hypervisor preemption, NMI),
and not sending out the IPI to that bitmask of
CPUs until after one of the CPUs in the bitmap
has gotten offlined?
