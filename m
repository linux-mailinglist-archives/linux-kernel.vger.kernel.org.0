This could still happen without the latency nice bias. I'm not sure if this
falls under DoS; maybe if you end up spawning a lot of task with high latency
nice value, then you might end up cramming a lot of tasks on a small subset of
CPUs. But then, shouldn't the logic that uses latency_nice try to handle this
case anyway since it could be legit?

Not sure if this can be used by someone to trigger timing based attacks on
another process.

I can't fully see the whole security implications, but regardless. I do agree
it is prudent to not allow tasks to set their own latency_nice. Mainly because
the meaning of this flag will be system dependent and I think Admins are the
better ones to decide how to use this flag for the system they're running on.
I don't think application writers should be able to tweak their tasks
latency_nice value. Not if they can't get the right privilege at least.
