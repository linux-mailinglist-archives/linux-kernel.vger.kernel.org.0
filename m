Sorry for being pedantic and not mentioning this earlier. Can you improve
the $subject. I prefer:

cpu-topology: Don't error on more than CONFIG_NR_CPUS CPUs in device tree

Also the commit log to be:
"
When the kernel is configured with CONFIG_NR_CPUS smaller than the
number of CPU nodes in the device tree(DT), all the CPU nodes parsing
done to fetch topology information will fail. This is not reasonable
as it is legal to have all the physical CPUs in the system in the DT.

Let us just skip such CPU DT nodes that are not used in the kernel
rather than returning an error.

I prefer (2) to be reword as below:
"
-ENODEV when the device tree(DT) node is valid and found in the DT but
there is no possible logical CPU in the kernel to match. This happens
when CONFIG_NR_CPUS is configure to be smaller than the number of CPU
nodes in DT. We need to just ignore this case.
"

With all these changes you can stick:
