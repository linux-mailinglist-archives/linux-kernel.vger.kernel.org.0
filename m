Ok, then I should drop the data_race() annotation and stick to READ_ONCE(),
I think (but see below).

The problem with taking that approach is that it ends up much of the
list implementation annotated with either WRITE_ONCE() or data_race(),
meaning that concurrent, racy list operations will no longer be reported
by KCSAN. I think that's a pretty big deal and I'm strongly against
annotating the internals of library code such as this because it means
that buggy callers will largely go undetected.

The situation we have here is that some calls, e.g. hlist_empty() are
safe even in the presence of a racy write and I'd like to suppress KCSAN
reports without annotating the writes at all.

Hmm, I suppose some bright spark will want to change the default at the some
point though, no? ;) I'll look at using
kcsan_disable_current()/kcsan_enable_current(), thanks.
