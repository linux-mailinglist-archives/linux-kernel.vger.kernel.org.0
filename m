This was the copy paste mistake from sdm845, I will convert the wdog 
bindings
to yaml and add missing SoC specific compatible for SC7180, SDM845 and 
SM8150.

This was before my time, but scratching my head and some internal docs
and git history reveals that watchdog was part of the timer block in
APQ8064, MSM8960. However in IPQ4019, watchdog was standalone and split
from timer block.

Below links gives us some more background:

Yes, SoC specific compatible should come first, I guess they just didn't 
care when
it was merged.

IPQ4019 had watchdog as standalone outside of timer block as explained 
above.

Needs a SoC specific compatible, I am going to add this in my coming 
patch.
