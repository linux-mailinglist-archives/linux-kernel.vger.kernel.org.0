One possibility would be to use SCHED_IDLE scheduling class rather than SCHED_OTHER
with nice +19. The unfortunate side-effect AFAIU shows up when a thread requests to
be pinned on a CPU which is continuously overcommitted. It may never run. This could
come as a surprise for the user. The only case where this would happen is if:

- A thread is pinned on CPU N, and
  - CPU N is not part of the allowed mask for the task's cpuset (and is overcommitted), or
  - CPU N is offline, and the fallback CPU is not part of the allowed mask for the
    task's cpuset (and is overcommitted).

Is it an acceptable behavior ? How is userspace supposed to detect this kind of situation
and mitigate it ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
