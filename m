The assumption that you need to have this regulator use functions that
use and provide ranges is the very thing I'm trying to get you to
change.  It looks like these regulators just need their own
set_voltage_sel() and get_voltage_sel() then they can use the standard
linear range mapping functions (and pobably the set_voltage_time_sel()
needs fixing anyway for all the other regulators).

There's already some conditional code in the probe function for handling
different operations for the over current protection and SAW stuff, this
looks like it should fit in reasonably well.  Usually this would be even
easier as probe functions are just data driven but for some reason more
than usual of this driver's data initializaiton is done dynamically.
