Okay... I'm just saying this might grow to become a lot of stuff as
people start having more and more use cases they want to support. But
if you think the kernel should be the one parsing all that, I'm happy
to defer to your expertise there (I'm not really a kernel guy after
all).

Right now it's just always CPU byte order of what coreboot happened to
run at, and it's not exporting that info in any way either. We don't
really have support for big-endian architectures anyway so it's not
something we really thought about yet. If it ever comes to that, I
assume the byte order of the table header's magic number could be used
to tell the difference.

I mean... should any of them be devices, then? All table entries are
just "some information", where are you defining the difference there?
I'm not sure if the current representation is the right one, but I
think they should probably all be handled in a consistent way.
