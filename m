Thanks!

I've had three people email me off list regarding the display working on
4.17 before the msm kms/drm driver was converted to the DRM atomic API so
this email is to get some more information out publicly.

I pushed up a branch to my github with 15 patches applied against 4.17
that has a working display:

https://github.com/masneyb/linux/commits/display-works-4.17

It's in low speed mode but its usable. The first 10 patches are in
mainline now and the last 5 are in essence this patch series with the
exception of 'drm/atomic+msm: add helper to implement legacy dirtyfb'.
There's a slightly different version of that patch in mainline now.

I'm planning to work on the msm8974 interconnect support once some of
the outstanding interconnect patches for the msm kms/drm driver arrive
in mainline. I'd really like to understand why the display works on
4.17 with those patches though. I assume that it's related to the
vblank events not working properly? Let me preface this with I'm a
total DRM newbie, but it looked like the pre-DRM-atomic driver wasn't
looking for these events in the atomic commits before the migration?
See commit 70db18dca4e0 ("drm/msm: Remove msm_commit/worker, use atomic
helper commit"), specifically the drm_atomic_helper_wait_for_vblanks()
call that was added.
