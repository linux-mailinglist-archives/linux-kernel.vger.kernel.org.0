Hi Naga,

Let me first point out that this comment was not trying to imply a bug.
I was trying to understand the code by comparing it to similar code and
that turned up an inconsistency, which can be intentional or a bug in
either of the sides being compared.

The problem at hand is that `addrs` is imprecise. In this code, there
are `instr->ctx.addr.addrs`, `addrs`, and `nfc_op->addrs`. All of them
are different. My original remark was targeting the possible confusion
of these different `addrs`.

Again, the lack of precision makes it difficult to discuss the matter.
You refer to `addr`, but there is no `addr`. I assume that you meant
`addrs` here. Based on that assumption, your second last statement is
wrong. The driver consumes `addrs[0]|addrs[-offset]` rather than
`addrs[0]` as the first byte.  Then it proceeds consuming
`addrs[1-offset]` instead of `addrs[1]`, `addrs[2-offset]` instead of
`addrs[2]`, and `addrs[3-offset]` instead of `addrs[3]`. Finally it
consumes `addrs[4]` and `addrs[5]` if more cycles are needed.

I would not have commented the code if it were actually using `addrs[0]`
through `addrs[5]`. Your description looks reasonable to me, but it
doesn't match the code.

I'm looking forward to the next version of the patch.

Helmut
