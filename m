Agreed.

If someone puts a kprobe on some TLB flush thing and an MCE does memory fail=
ure handling, it would be polite to avoid crashing.  OTOH the x86 memory fai=
lure story is *so* bad that I=E2=80=99m not sure how well we can ever really=
 expect this to work.

I think we should aim to get the entry part correct, and if the meat of the f=
unction explodes, so be it.
