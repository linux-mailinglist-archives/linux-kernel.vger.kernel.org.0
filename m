The serial8250 is the name of (generic) platform driver of 8250 which can be
used as a child for MFD.

Why not? Again, *slicing* resources is OK and that's what MFD for, *requesting*
them in the parent is not.

Nope, *requesting* resources as you mentioned lock them to the certain user.

There is nothing to change. It's already working. I don't see a problem here.
