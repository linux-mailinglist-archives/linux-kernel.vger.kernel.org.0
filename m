We could do that, nvme_command and nvme_completion are already UAPI.
On the other hand that would mean not filling out certain fields like
command_id. Can do an approach like this.

I'm not sure how those tests could be implemented otherwise today.
The goal is to send an arbitrary command to the target and the passthru
command is AFAIK the only solution. If we have something better
I'm sure they will be ready to use it.
