Some comments on:

      f6520c52084 (epoll: simplify ep_poll_safewake() for CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC)

For one this does not play nice with preempt_rt as disabling irq and
then taking a spinlock_t is a no no; the critical region becomes
preemptible. This is particularly important as -rt is being mainlined.

Secondly, it is really ugly compared to what we had before - albeit not
having to deal with all the ep_call_nested() checks, but I doubt this
overhead matters at all with CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC.

While the current logic avoids nesting by disabling irq during the whole
path, this seems like an overkill under debug. This patch proposes using
this_cpu_inc_return() then taking the irq-safe lock - albeit a possible
irq coming in the middle between these operations and messing up the
subclass. If this is unacceptable, we could always revert the patch,
as this was never a problem in the first place.

This is pretty much untested - I wanted to see what is the best way to
address the concerns first.

XXX: I don't think we need get/put_cpu() around the call, this was intended
only for ep_call_nested() tasks_call_list checking afaict.
