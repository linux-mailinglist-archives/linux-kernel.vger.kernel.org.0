Yeah, I know it is. ;-)

Yep.

Which is what breaks the current algorithm (without this update).

OK, how about I update the change log and add a comment that states
that this can change. But even if it does, it wont break anything but
show the wrong stack size, which is usually only important for us
kernel developers anyway ;-)

Let me send a v2.
