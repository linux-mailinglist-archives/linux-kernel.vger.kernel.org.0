Sure, I've seen that comment.  But it doesn't help either because it's not
guaranteed that we'll receive the replies from the OSDs in the same order
we've sent them.  Stopping the counter when we get an error doesn't
provide us any reliable information (which means I can simply drop that
counter).

To be honest, I'm starting to lean towards this option.  Reverting to
serializing requests or to plain copy on error will not necessarily
prevent the stray objects:

  - send a bunch of copy requests
  - wait for them to complete
     * 1 failed, the other 63 succeeded
  - revert to serialized copies, repeating the previous 64 requests
     * after a few copies, we get another failure (maybe on the same OSDs)
       and abort, leaving behind some stray objects from the previous bulk
       request

I guess the only way around this would be some sort of atomic operation
that would allow us to copy a bunch of objects in a single operation
(copy-from3!)

I thought a bit a about this while watching Jeff and Patrick's talk at
FOSDEM (great talk, by the way!) but I don't think async directory
operations have this problem because the requests there are
metadata-related and a failure in a request is somewhat independent from
other requests.

Yep, 20200205102852.12236-1-lhenriques@suse.com should fix that (Cc'ed
stable@ as well).
