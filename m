Ah, right you are!

And thanks for the idea in the first place :-)

I *think* so. At least, I was going off of
drivers/base/firmware_loader/builtin/Makefile and
scripts/recordmcount.pl, which were the only other places that I found
that reference the %progbits vs @progbits oddity. They only use
%progbits in the case of CONFIG_ARM and @progbits for other
arches. I wasn't sure about arm64, but I looked at the assembly files
gcc produced and it looked like @progbits was used there. Added some
arm64 people to CC since they would know :-)

I think this would work, and it feels like the more correct solution
especially if arm isn't the only one with the odd progbits char. It
might be overkill if it's just arm that's affected though. I leave it
to Masahiro to see what he prefers.

Thanks!
