As far as I know ATF implements PSCI, doesn't it? Thus I would assume 
that it should most definitely handle power off for all platforms as 
indicated by the presence of platform handlers in [1].

Maybe I'm missing something here but I'd suggest that implementing an 
i2c driver in the rockchip platform part of ATF using libfdt to find the 
PMIC from the devicetree would be the way to go.
