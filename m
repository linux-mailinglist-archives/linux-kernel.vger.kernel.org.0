Why?

Yes, statistically the numbers are proportionally divided.

but you will (probably) never see the real stime == 1000 && utime == 10000
numbers if you watch incrementally.

Just in case... yes I know that these numbers can only "converge" to the
reality, only their sum is correct. But people complain.
