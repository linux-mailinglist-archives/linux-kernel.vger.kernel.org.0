It now reads as follows:

	To fix this properly, this commit waits until system_state is
	set to SYSTEM_RUNNING before starting the test.  This change is
	made just before kernel_init() invokes rcu_end_inkernel_boot(),
	and this latter is what turns off boot-time expediting of RCU
	grace periods.

I dropped the last paragraph about late_initcall().  And I suspect that
the last clause from rcu_gp_is_expedited() can be dropped:

bool rcu_gp_is_expedited(void)
{
	return rcu_expedited || atomic_read(&rcu_expedited_nesting) ||
	       rcu_scheduler_active == RCU_SCHEDULER_INIT;
}

This is because rcu_expedited_nesting is initialized to 1, and is
decremented in rcu_end_inkernel_boot(), which is called long after
rcu_scheduler_active has been set to RCU_SCHEDULER_RUNNING, which
happens at core_initcall() time.  So if the last clause says "true",
so does the second-to-last clause.

The similar check in rcu_gp_is_normal() is still need, however, to allow
the power-management subsystem to invoke synchronize_rcu() just after
the scheduler has been initialized, but before RCU is aware of this.

So, how about the commit shown below?

							Thanx, Paul

commit 1f7e72efe3c761c2b34da7b59e01ad69c657db10
Author: Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@linux.ibm.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 5 08:05:10 2019 -0700

    rcu: Remove redundant "if" condition from rcu_gp_is_expedited()
    
    Because rcu_expedited_nesting is initialized to 1 and not decremented
    until just before init is spawned, rcu_expedited_nesting is guaranteed
    to be non-zero whenever rcu_scheduler_active == RCU_SCHEDULER_INIT.
    This commit therefore removes this redundant "if" equality test.
