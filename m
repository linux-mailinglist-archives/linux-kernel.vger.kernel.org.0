re-reading this, it looks like you are defining the controller bindings, 
but there are no real controller-level properties except for the fact 
that they include slave bindings?

In MIPI the notion of controller is that it can deal with multiple 
links, each of which having specific properties (clock speed, clock stop 
properties, etc).

Wondering if we are talking about different concepts?

Rob's point was about the InstanceID

"Assuming you could have more than 1 of the same device on the bus,
then you need some way to distinguish them and the way that's done for
DT is unit-address/reg. And compatible strings should be constant for
each instance."

You can use the MIPI encoding *except* for the InstanceID, that'd be 
fine. It'll just be a bit weird since the Slave device will report the 
48 bits that include the Instance ID, so you'll have to special case 
this field, but if this is a DT requirement then fine.

Rob's point does not apply to the link ID - which is used when you have 
multiple masters in your controller. The Slave device is attached in one 
location and will never move, so that is a constant value.

the version is a 4 bit value starting at 1 for SoundWire 1.0. There is 
nothing in the spec that talks about a limit to 9.

It's unlikely we'll ever reach that but you are interpreting a spec 
here. plus just below you mention all fields as being hexadecimal.
