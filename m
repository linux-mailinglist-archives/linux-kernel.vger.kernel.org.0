Yeah, subsystems will likely have their own "man pages" for for sysctls.

Both the dvb and the v4l2 ones are part of what used to be the DocBook
manpages for those syscalls. If I'm not mistaken, we ended by expanded 
the same approach for the media controller, for CEC and for RC.

There is one way of keeping it while avoiding troubles: you could
create internal names, for example using the current dir, auto-adding
the ":name:" tag when a declaration conflict rises. Not sure how
easy/hard would be to implement it.

Btw, at get_abi.pl, I had to do a trick like that, as some symbols
have a "local context". The good thing at ABI files is that the context
is clear: it is valid only between "What:" and "Description:" fields.

Also, as it is a single script that parses the entire ABI (it takes
on ~0.1 seconds to parse everything and store internally on my machine),
the logic there detects when an existing symbol is re-used on a different
context. When this happens, it adds a random char at the end of the
internal reference, while keeping the original name[1].

[1] on the the highly unlikely event that the new name still repeats,
it adds a new random char - until the name gets different.

Probably doing it at automarkup won't be that simple, but it could
work.

Thanks,
Mauro
