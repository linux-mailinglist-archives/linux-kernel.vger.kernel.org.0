Hi Enric,

some comments inline, a bit late, but I just tested this on veyron
minnie.

I don't quite follow the heuristics above. Are you sure the number of
PWM bits can be infered from the period? What if the period value (in
ns) doesn't directly correspond to a register value? And even if it
did, counting the number of set bits (the above loops is a
re-implementation of ffs()) doesn't really result in the dividers
mentioned in the comment. E.g. a period of 32768 ns (0x8000) results
in a divider of 1, i.e. 32768 brighness levels.

On veyron minnie the period is 1000000 ns, which results in 142858
levels (1000000 / 7)!

Not sure if there is a clean solution using heuristics, a DT property
specifying the number of levels could be an alternative. This could
also be useful to limit the number of (mostly) redundant levels, even
the intended max of 4096 seems pretty high.

Another (not directly related) observation is that on minnie the
actual brightness at a nominal 50% is close to 0 (duty cycle ~3%). I
haven't tested with other devices, but I wonder if it would make
sense to have an option to drop the bottom N% of levels, since the
near 0 brightness in the lower 50% probably isn't very useful in most
use cases, but maybe it looks different on other devices.

Cheers

Matthias
