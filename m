Hm, I see this as a normal MFD device. The Boot controller provides a
set of physically mapped ROMs and a DW APB SSI-based embedded SPI
controller. Yes, the SPI controller is normally utilized to access an external
flash device, and at boot stage it is used for it. But still it's a SPI
controller which driver belongs to the kernel SPI subsystem. Moreover
nothing prevents a platform designer from using it together with custom
GPIO-based chip-selects to have additional devices on the SPI bus.

As I said the problem is that an SPI flash might be accessed either with
use of a physically mapped ROM or via the normal DW APB SPI controller.
These two interfaces can't be used simultaneously, because the ROM is
just an rtl state-machine, which is built to translate MMIO operations
through the SPI controller registers to an external SPI-nor at CS0 of
the interface. That's why first I need to make sure the interface is locked,
then being enabled, then the corresponding driver can use it, then get
to unlock. That's the point of having the __bt1_bc_spi_lock() and
bt1_bc_spi_unlock() methods exported from the driver.

I've got two drivers for MTD ROM and SPI controller based on that
methods. But I haven't submitted them yet, because they belong to two
different subsystems and I need to have this one being accepted first.

Recently I've sent an RFC regarding a different question, but it
concerns the Baikal-T1 system controller and the boot controller as being part
of it:
