Ah, you're using the old "mmu-masters" binding (and in a way which isn't 
well-defined - it's never been specified what the stream ID argument(s) 
would mean for a PCI host bridge, and Linux just ignores them). The 
ideal thing would be to update the DT to generic "iommu-map" properties 
- it's been a long time since I last played with a ThunderX, but I 
believe the SMMU stream IDs should just be the same as the ITS device 
IDs (which is how the "mmu-masters" mapping would have played out anyway).

The arm-smmu driver support for the old binding has always relied on 
implicit bypass - there are technical reasons why we can't realistically 
support the full functionality offered to the generic bindings, but it 
would be possible to add some degree of workaround to prevent it 
interacting quite so poorly with disable_bypass, if necessary. Do you 
have deployed systems with DTs that can't be updated, but still might 
need to run new kernels?

Robin.
