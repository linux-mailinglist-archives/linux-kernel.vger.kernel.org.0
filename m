QGP0 is the same hardware block as &qupv3_id_0, but apparently both are
only representing a smaller part - and different ones.

But conceptually both represents the wrapper...

I see, so the PEP states needs to be parsed and associated with each
device and we would use pm_runtime to toggle between the states and
device_links to ensure that _DEP nodes are powered in appropriate order.

That seems reasonable and straight forward and the reliance on
pm_runtime will make the DT case cleaner as well.

Yeah, I saw this as well. If all the SEs where the wrappers iommu domain
things should work fine by mapping it on the se->dev, regardless of the
device's being linked together.

The remaining relationship to the wrapper would then be reduced to the
read of the version to check for 1.0 or 1.1 hardware in the SPI driver,
which can be replaced by the assumption that we're on 1.1.

Right but this only describes the IOMMU devices, I don't see any
information about how individual client devices relates to the various
IOMMU contexts.

Per the current driver design the wrapper device is the parent of the
SE, I should have seen that 8bc529b25354 was the beginning of a game of
whac-a-mole circumventing this design. Sorry for not spotting this
earlier.

But if this is the one whack left to get the thing to boot then I think
we should merge it.

Sounds good.
