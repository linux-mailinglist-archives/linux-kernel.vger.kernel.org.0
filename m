I used parallel kernel compilation test to see if there is a performance
benefit. I did see the compile time get reduced by a few seconds out of
several minutes of total time on average. So it is only about 1% or so.
I didn't mention it as it is within the margin of error.

One of the goals of this patchset is to make sure that little or no
performance regression is introduced. That was why I was hesitant to
adopt the single allocator approach as suggested. That is also why I add
this patch to try to get some performance back.
