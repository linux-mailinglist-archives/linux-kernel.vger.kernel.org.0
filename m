Yes, physical addresses are fine for SEV - the key is that the DMA API is
used so that an address for unencrypted, or shared, memory is returned.
E.g. for a dma_alloc_coherent() call this is an allocation that has had
set_memory_decrypted() called or for a dma_map_page() call this is an
address from SWIOTLB, which was mapped shared during boot, where the data
will be bounce-buffered.

We don't currently support an emulated IOMMU in our SEV guest because that
would require a lot of support in the driver to make IOMMU data available
to the hypervisor (I/O page tables, etc.). We would need hardware support
to really make this work easily in the guest.

Thanks,
Tom
