On Linux, there is no such thing as "too early", that's the problem.

First, we already had one lesson about this, regarding applications that =

require libraries from /usr. There, it was due to various programs that=20
run from udev rules, and dynamic/unpredictable dependencies. See=20
https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/separate-usr-is-broken/,=20
almost all arguments from there apply 1:1 here.

Second, people/distributions put unexpected stuff into their initramfs=20
images, and we cannot say that they have no right to do so. E.g., on my=20
system that's "cryptsetup" that unlocks the root partition, but manages=20
to read a few bytes of uninitialized urandom before that. A warning here =

is almost unavoidable, and thus will be treated as SPAM.

No such considerations apply to OpenBSD (initramfs does not exist, and=20
there is no equivalent of udev that reacts to cold-plug events by=20
running programs), that's why the getentropy() design works there.

If we were to fix it, we should focus on making true entropy available=20
unconditionally, even before /init in the initramfs starts, and warn not =

on the first access to urandom, but on the exec of /init. Look -=20
distributions are already running "haveged" which harvests entropy from=20
clock jitter. And they still manage to do it wrong (regardless whether=20
the "haveged" idea is wrong by itself), by running it too late (at least =

I don't know any kind of stock initramfs with either it or rngd=20
included). So it's too complex, and needs to be simplified.

The kernel already has jitterentropy-rng, it uses the same idea as=20
"haveged", but, alas, it is exposed as a crypto rng algorithm, not a=20
hwrng. And I think it is a bug: cryptoapi rng algorithms are for things=20
that get a seed and generate random numbers by rehashing it over and=20
over, while jitterentropy-rng requires no seed. Would a patch be=20
accepted to convert it to hwrng? (this is essentially the reverse of=20
what commit c46ea13 did for exynos-rng)

Please don't forget about people who run Linux on Hyper-V, not on KVM,=20
and thus have no access to virtio-rng ;)

Well, at this point, I see that there is a lot of disagreement about how =

getrandom() should behave, aggravated by the baggage of existing=20
applications and libraries with contradictory requirements regarding=20
getrandom(0) (so not really solvable). I am almost convinced that we=20
might want to return -ENOSYS unconditionally, and create a different=20
system call with sane flags.
