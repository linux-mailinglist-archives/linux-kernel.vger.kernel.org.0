Thanks for confirming.

This more or less means we need to improve the hierarchical support in
genpd to support more levels, such that it makes sense to have a genpd
governor assigned at more than one level. This doesn't work well
today. As I also have stated, this is on my todo list for genpd.

However, I also agree with your standpoint, that let's start simple to
enable the deepest state as a start with, then we can improve things
on top.

Kind regards
Uffe
