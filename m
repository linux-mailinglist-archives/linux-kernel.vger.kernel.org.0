Hi Charles!

Thanks for finding this!

I kind of get it... I think.

I see it fixes a patch that I was not CC:ed on, which is a bit unfortunate
as it tries to fix something I wrote, but such things happen.

The original patch
f3186dd87669 ("spi: Optionally use GPIO descriptors for CS GPIOs")
came with the assumption that native chip select handler needed
was to be converted to always expect a true (1) value to their
->set_cs() callbacks for asserting chip select, and this was one of
the drivers augmented to expect that.

As
3e5ec1db8bfe ("spi: Fix SPI_CS_HIGH setting when using native and GPIO CS")
essentially undo that semantic change and switches back to
the old semantic, all the drivers that were converted to expect
a high input to their ->set_cs() callbacks for asserting CS need
to be reverted back as well, but that didn't happen.

So we need to fix not just cadence but also any other driver setting
->use_gpio_descriptors() and also supplying their own
->set_cs() callback and expecting this behaviour, or the fix
will have fixed broken a bunch of drivers.

But we are lucky: there aren't many of them.
In addition to spi-cadence.c this seems to affect only spi-dw.c
and I suppose that is what Gregory was using? Or
something else?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
