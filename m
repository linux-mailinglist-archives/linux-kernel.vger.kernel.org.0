I may just answer your question here.

Besides the page allocator, cpu allocator or scheduler may need to
know about the node id to figure out which cpu to run is more
optimized, like in workqueue_select_cpu_near().

From the node checking:
'(unsigned)node_id >= nr_node_ids'

If the nr_node_ids > 0, then node 0 is a valid node according to
the above checking, is there a function to check if a node is
missing?

Also, I am not sure if I understand "nothing should really care".
Does it means a device still can be a numa that is missing, just
have some performance degradation?

Do you mean let kzalloc_node handle the NUMA_NO_NODE case, if node
id is NUMA_NO_NODE, kzalloc_node handles it as numa_mem_id().

If yes, above makes more sense.
