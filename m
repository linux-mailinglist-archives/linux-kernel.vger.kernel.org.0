Yes, this is what we agreed on.

The consoles will just iterate the ringbuffer. So if any console needs
dictionary information, that information needs to be stored in the
ringbuffer as well.

The dictionary text and message text could be stored as concatenated
strings. The descriptor would point separately to the beginning of
dictionary and message. So the data-buffer would still be a clean
collection of text. But AFAIK Linus didn't want to see that "extra" text
at all.

If we want to keep dictionary text out of the data-buffer, we could have
a 2nd data-buffer dedicated for dictionary text. I expect it would not
really complicate things. Especially if the dictionary part was "best
effort" (i.e. if the dictionary text does not fit in the free part of
its data-buffer, it is dropped).
