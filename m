It has nothing to do with fighting at all, it has to do with offering
what applications *need* without breaking existing assumptions that
make most applications work. And more importantly it involves not
silently breaking applications which need good randomness for long
lived keys because the breakage will not be visible initially and can
hit them hard later. Right now most applications which block in the
early stages are only victim of the current situation and their
developers possibly didn't understand the possible impacts of lack
of entropy (or how real an issue it was). These applications do need
to be able to get low-quality random without blocking forever,
provided these are not accidently used by those who need security. At
some point, just like for any syscall, the doc makes the difference.

No. What is hard to use is often misused. It must be harder to misuse
it, which means it should be easier to correctly use it. The choice of
flag names and the emission of warnings definitely helps during the
development stage.

Which is how adding new flags can definitely help even if adoption takes
time. By the way in this discussion I am a userspace developer and have
been hit several times by libraries switching to getrandom() that silently
failed to respond in field. As a userspace developer, I really want to see
a solution to this problem. And I'm fine if the kernel decides to kill
haproxy for using getrandom() with the old settings, at least users will
notice, will complain to me and will update.
