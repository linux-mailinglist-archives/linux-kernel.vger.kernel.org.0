Just to clarify, the original kernel is booted with mgag200 turned
off, then kexec works, but if the original kernel loads mgag200, the
kexec kernels resets hard when the VGA is used to write stuff out.

This *might* be fixable in the controlled kexec case, but having an
mgag200 shutdown path that tries to put the gpu back into a state
where VGA doesn't die, but for the uncontrolled kexec it'll still be a
problem, since once the gpu is up and running and VGA is disabled, it
doesn't expect to see anymore VGA transactions.
