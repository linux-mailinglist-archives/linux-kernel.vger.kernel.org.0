Hi Anders,

Yeah, I got the idea.

So when you say "'make savedefconfig' CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN will be 
dropped", I don't know what the rules are in terms of resyncing the 
common defconfig (I was under the impression that it's done per release 
cycle by the arm soc maintainers, but can't find evidence as such), but 
your change may be easily lost in this way.

Thanks,
John
