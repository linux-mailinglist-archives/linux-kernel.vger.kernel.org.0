No, because you also add the drm_encoder. That cannot be hotadded/removed
right now. So you'd need to add a drm_encoder preemptively for all
writeback connectors you might need, which doesn't make much sense.

writeback is generally a SoC feature. I don't think anyone expects that
you can hotplug a writeback connector.

virtual should be a top-level property. I'm not aware of any real driver
where vblank works on some connector/crtc, but not on another one.

> echo 1 > instanceN/connector/virtual0/enable

For the initial connectors those don't need separate enable properties,
they get enabled with the global enable knob.

For hotplugged connectors we need a separate enable knob. But we're still
_very_ far away from making that possible I think.

Also hotunplug behaviour. We can take out an entire drm_device, and make
sure userspace and the kernel copes correctly. This is _really_ hard to
get right on both sides.

And it's a real thing with stuff like usb display link.

Imo we should phase out module options, or at least not add more. Then you
can just have a small script which sets up the vkms device you want, and
then run the tests. I'd go further even, and say we should have
default_device=0 knob to start out with nothing when you load the driver.
