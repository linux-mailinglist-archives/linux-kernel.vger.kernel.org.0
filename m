Subject: [PATCH] arm64: Allow disabling of the compat vDSO
Date:   Wed, 25 Sep 2019 14:09:26 +0100

The compat vDSO building requires a cross-compiler than produces AArch32
binaries, defined via CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT_VDSO or the
CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT environment variable. If none of these is defined,
building the kernel always prints a warning as there is no way to
deselect the compat vDSO.

Add an arm64 Kconfig entry to allow the deselection of the compat vDSO.
In addition, make it an EXPERT option, default n, until other issues
with the compat vDSO are solved (64-bit only kernel headers included in
user-space vDSO code, CC_IS_CLANG irrelevant to CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT).

It looks like you can't really win with the current compat vDSO logic.
You either don't have a compat cross-compiler and you get a Makefile
warning or you have one and a get a compiler warning (or failure)
because of the 64-bit kernel headers included in 32-bit user-space code.

"depends on BROKEN" for ARM64_COMPAT_VDSO also work for me instead of
EXPERT. I'll leave it up to Will to decide but I'd like at least this
patch in -rc2 (even better if everything else is fixed before the final
5.4).

Suggestions for future improvements of the compat vDSO handling:

- replace the CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT prefix with a full COMPATCC; maybe
  check that it indeed produces 32-bit code

- check whether COMPATCC is clang or not rather than CC_IS_CLANG, which
  only checks the native compiler

- clean up the headers includes; vDSO should not include kernel-only
  headers that may even contain code patched at run-time
