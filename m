The current approach makes use of ftrace's profiling capabilities in
conjunction with a hashtable and preallocated memory for its entries.
When active, this oneshot-profiler will only perform lookups for ip and
parent_ip and insert those when necessary. Compared to the "oneshot"
option this allows to omit values that are not required for kernel
profiling such as interrupt flags, etc. However, I am not sure how huge
this may impact the performance.

Nonetheless, the profiling variant allows to remove duplicated entries
(due to there being one hashset per CPU core) before outputting its
gathered data. Additionally, it is independent of the ringbuffer which
may overflow due to other tracers being active (However, I am not sure
if or in which way different tracers are isolated from each other when
using the ringbuffer, so this may as well be false).

In case you want to incorporate this oneshot functionality directly into
the function tracer as a new option it may be useful to allow
configuring the tracer's oneshot capabilities. This way, one could
disable tracing of a function after its first occurrence or instead keep
tracing enabled in order to get a better overview over where it was
called from (-> recording the parent_ip is also interesting).

Yours sincerely,
Thomas
