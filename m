Hmm, but it appears to be either working or failing silently for me, which
doesn't match what Arnd is seeing. I'd prefer to fix genksyms but I'm not
happy touching it if I can't show it's broken to begin with. If I pass '-w'
I see it barfing on all sorts of random stuff, for example the static_assert
in include/linux/fs.h:

	static_assert(offsetof(struct filename, iname) % sizeof(long) == 0);
