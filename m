I agree that it is more suitable api. However, that would need much more
conversions for the existing "class_find_device()" , which are not touched by
the series and would make this series even more bigger. With that said, I
am fine with implementing the suggestion if Greg/Rafael thinks that is fine.

Unfortunately, yes.

Yes, and trimmed manually a bit to remove the "commit-signers".
I have tried to keep only the maintainers/reviewers/supporters.
Thanks for the option, I will give that a try.
