Hi Denis,

I just saw this on LWN and would like to thank you for picking
up floppy support as it’s important (especially for interfacing
with esoteric hardware). I’m also collecting a few drives so I
can use a spare if one breaks… usable discs are becoming a problem
though ☹

bye,

not, like many before him, shrug and move on; instead, he took it upon
himself to start compiling things, just so he could compile his shell.
How's that for dedication. -- Wouter, about my Debian/m68k revival
