I think you could still keep setting the minimum size and wait for the
"insufficient" event. At the same time, you could speculatively
advertise the expected "sufficient" size on the CAPTURE queue before
the hardware signals those. Even if you mispredict them, you'll get
the event, update the CAPTURE resolution and send the source change
event to the application, which would then give you the correct
buffers. Would that work for you?

Best regards,
Tomasz
