Guenter,

Yep. However, for "big boxes" you'll typically get that information from
SAF-TE or SES enclosure services and not from the drive itself.

SES allows you to monitor power supplies, drive bays, hot swap events,
thermals, etc. We have a SES driver in SCSI that exposes all these
things in sysfs. It is not currently tied into hwmon.

Yep. That's why there's dedicated plumbing in smartmontools to handle
various RAID controller interfaces for accessing physical drive
information. It's typically highly vendor-specific.

Not really. Target is usually a pretty good approximation, although some
arrays introduce virtual targets because of limited LUN (scsi_device)
numbering capabilities. However, arrays generally don't support per-LUN
temperature because it makes no sense.

I'm trying to gauge how much a pain potentially redundant sensors would
be for userland monitoring tooling vs. how many oddball devices we'd not
be able to support if we were to use scsi_target as parent (or restrict
the sensor binding to LUN 0).
