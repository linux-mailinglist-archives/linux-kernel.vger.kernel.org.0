So what would the more complicated heaps be?

My suggestion is to merge the system and CMA heaps.  CMA (at least
the system-wide CMA area) is really just an optimization to get
large contigous regions more easily.  We should make use of it as
transparent as possible, just like we do in the DMA code.
