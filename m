Why? it's not uncommon to have bugzilla links, why would we lose the 
publicly-available information because GitHub is used?

this is formatted by emacs, and with long words you get spaces at the end.

we cannot concurrently stop two streams since we take a bus lock. That's 
a problem but it'll have to be addressed separately. the problem with 
multiple streams addressed here is when one is CONFIGURED, which does 
not require a bus lock.
