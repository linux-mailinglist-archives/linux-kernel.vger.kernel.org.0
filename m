I am not sure this is the proper fix, see below inline.

That looks reasonable, yes.

So did you actually see a problem, and this patch fixes it? Or was this
just discovered by code inspection and comparing to the spec?

I think you are right in this is not needed here.
But I guess this call belongs further up in this function, after the
gic_mask_irq() call, as this one writes to GICD_ICENABLER. So in case this
IRQ was enabled, we should wait for the distributor to have properly
disabled it, before changing its affinity.

Cheers,
Andre.
