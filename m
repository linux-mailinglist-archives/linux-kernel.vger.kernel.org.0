Yes ... but that's somewhat of a bigger patch because you now have to
reason about the callbacks within cdrom.  There's also the question of
whether you can assume ops->generic_packet() has its own concurrency
protections ... it's certainly true for SCSI, but is it for anything
else?  Although I suppose you can just not care and run the internal
lock over it anyway.
