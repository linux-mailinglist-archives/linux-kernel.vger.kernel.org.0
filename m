No, your understanding is right.  I found that the last (and most important)
part of patch description ("this behavior is wrong") might be wrong.
Sorry about that and let me correct myself:

  - before commit 6bc9b56433b76, the return value of soft offline is the
    return of migrate_page(). dissolve_free_huge_page()'s return value is
    ignored.

  - after commit 6bc9b56433b76 soft_offline_huge_page() returns success
    only dissolve_free_huge_page() returns success.

This change is *mainly OK* (meaning nothing is broken), but there still
remains the room of improvement, that is, even in "dissolved from
free_huge_page()" case, we can try to call set_hwpoison_free_buddy_page() to
contain the 4kB error page, but we don't try it now because
dissolve_free_huge_page() return -EBUSY for !PageHuge case.

Yes, the change is actually an 'improvement' purely related to hugetlb,
and seems not a 'bug fix'. So I'll update the description.
Maybe no need to separate to patches.
