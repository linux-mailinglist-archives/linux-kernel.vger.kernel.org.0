Unfortunately selecting the class alone is not enough. The USB role
switch on the system may be a dual-role capable USB controller, but it
may also be a mux that has its own separate driver.

It's equally or even more confusing for the user if the USB drivers
are enabled, including the dual-role mode, but the connector still
works only in one role, or in worst case not at all (if there is no
mux driver and the mux is left in "safe mode" so that the pins on the
connector are not connected to anything).

I still think that we should make these drivers depend on the class
instead of just selecting it. That way we at least give the user a
hint that there are also separate USB role switch drivers that may be
needed.

We can always use something like conditional comments in the
Kconfig files to make sure that the user is told that in order to
select the driver, a dependency must be satisfied:

        config MY_AWESOME_DRIVER
                tristate "My awesome driver!"
                depends on USB_ROLE_SWITCH
                help
                  That's right! IT REALLY IS AWESOME!

        comment "My awesome driver depends on USB_ROLE_SWITCH..."
                depends on USB_ROLE_SWITCH=n

thanks,
