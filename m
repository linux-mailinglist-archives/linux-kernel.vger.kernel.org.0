See the entry series I'm working on. Aside of moving all this nonsense
into C-code it splits lockdep and tracing so it looks like this:

            lockdep_hardirqs_off();
            user_exit_irqsoff();
            __trace_hardirqs_off();

The latter uses regular RCU and not the scru/rcu_irq dance.

That split exist for a few weeks now at least in my patches :)

How do you "fix" that when you can't reach the tracepoint because you
trip over a breakpoint and then while trying to fixup that stuff you hit
another one?
