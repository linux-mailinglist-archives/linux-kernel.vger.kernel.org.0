As a meta-comment, I found this series very hard to understand in the context
of reading the new code for the first time.  When I read the code again in
six months or a year or two years it will not be in near term memory and it
will be as if I am reading it for the first time.  A lot of my suggestions
for changes of names are in that context -- the current names may be fine
when one has recently read the code, but not so much when trying to read
the whole thing again with a blank mind.

The code also inherits a good deal of complexity because it does not stand
alone in a nice discrete chunk, but instead delicately weaves into a more
complex body of code.

When I was trying to understand the code, I wrote a lot of additional
comments within my reply email to provide myself context, information
about various things, and questions that I needed to answer (or if I
could not answer to then ask you).  Then I ended up being able to remove
many of those notes before sending the reply.

I agree with the intent of trying to describe the semantics of a function,
especially at the API level where other systems (or drivers) would be using
the function.  But for this case the function is at the implementation level
and describing explicitly what it is doing makes this much more readable for
me.

I also find "Mark device" to be vague and not descriptive of what the
intent is.

My comment is left over from when I was taking notes, trying to understand the
code.

At the moment, only devicetree is used as a source of the dependency information.
The comment would better be re-phrased as:

        * Scan all consumer devices in the firmware description of the hardware topology

I did not ask why this feature is tied to _only_ the platform bus, but will now.

I do not know of any reason that a consumer / supplier relationship can not be
between devices on different bus types.  Do you know of such a reason?

Note that my version of these comments was written while I was reading the code,
and did not have any big picture understanding yet.  This will likely also be
the mind set of most everyone who reads this code in the future, once it is
woven into the kernel.

If you don't like the change, I can revisit it in a later version of the
patch set.

Naming new fields or variables related to device links looks pretty
challenging to me, because of the desire to be part of device links
and not a wart pasted on the side.  So I share the pain in trying
to find good names.

> 
> Maybe device_link_add_missing_suppliers()?

My first reaction was "yes, that sounds good".  But then I stopped and
tried to read the name out of context.  The name is not adding the
missing suppliers, it is saving the information that a supplier is
not yet available (eg, is "missing").  I struggled in coming up with
the name that I suggested.  We can keep thinking.

Yeah, I didn't like that either.

> list?

The side effect is that the function does not merely do a check.  It also
adds missing suppliers to a list.


> 
> Maybe device_link_try_removing_from_wfs()?

I like that, other than the fact that it still does not provide a clue
that the function is potentially adding suppliers to a list.  I think
part of the challenge is that the function does two things: (1) a check,
and (2) potentially adding missing suppliers to a list.  Maybe a simple
one line comment at the call site, something like:

   /* adds missing suppliers to wfs */

Yes, brain mis-fire on my part.  I'll have to go back and look at the
list related code again.

If just as good and shorter, then better.

Also the original says "it is not ready to probe".  That is not correct.  It
is ready to probe, it is just that the probe attempt will return -EPROBE_DEFER.
Nit picky on my part, but tiny things like that mean I have to think harder.
I have to think "why is it not ready to probe?".  Maybe my version should have
instead been something like:

        * Device waiting for supplier to become available will return
        * -EPROBE_DEFER if probed.  Avoid the unneeded processing.

"the other devices (consumers) have been waiting for this device (supplier)".
Isn't that a list of needed suppliers?

The original comment is vague.  It does not explain why consumer links must be
created before the probe.  I had to go off and read other code to determine
why that is true.

And again, brevity is better if otherwise just as clear.

I didn't remove it.  I rephrased it with a little bit more explanation as
"If some suppliers are not yet available, this function will be
called again when the suppliers become available." (below).

This is conflating bus with the source of the firmware description of the
hardware topology.  For drivers that use various APIs to access firmware
description of topology that may be either devicetree or ACPI the access
is done via fwnode_operations, based on struct device.fwnode (if I recall
properly).

I failed to completely address why add_links() is not needed.  The answer
is that there should be a single function called for all buses.  Then
the proper firmware data source would be accessed via a struct fwnode_operations.

I think I left this out because I had not yet asked why this feature is
tied only to the platform bus.  Which I asked earlier in this reply.

Is creating links to consumers of this device implemented in this patch
series?  If so, I overlooked it and will have to consider how that
fits in to the design.

Aha, I got confused about that while trying to keep everything straight.

Somehow I managed to conflate needs_suppliers with the links between
consumers and suppliers that are create via device_link_add().

So original comment is fine.

It is getting late, so I'll continue with patches 2 and 3 tomorrow.
