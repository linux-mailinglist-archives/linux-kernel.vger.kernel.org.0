Any chance I can convince you to provide some official tags like
Reviewed-by or Tested-by on the revert?

I'm not sure there's any single magic commit I can point to.  When I
started working on dw_mmc it was terrible at handling error cases and
would often crash / hang / stop all future communication upon certain
classes or efforts.  There were dozens of problems we've had to fix
over the years.  These problems showed up when we started supporting
HS200 / UHS since the tuning phase really stress the error handling of
the host controller.

I searched and by the time we were supporting Broadcom SDIO cards the
error handling was already pretty good.  ...but if we hadn't already
made the error handling more robust for UHS tuning then we would have
definitely hit these types of problems.  The only problem I remember
having to solve in dw_mmc that was unique to Broadcom was commit
0bdbd0e88cf6 ("mmc: dw_mmc: Don't start commands while busy").  Any
chance that could be what you're hitting?

What host controller are you having problems with?
