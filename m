Thank you for your advice. I have made two separated patches on your advice.
Please check these patches, https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/26/125 and
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/8/26/163.

In my opinion, the last link you gave me had two problems with AMD's
fTPM. One problem was the ACPI NVS area was set to the busy area, and
TPM regions of the ACPI table were in it. Therefore, TPM CRB driver
couldn't allocate command and response buffers in it because ACPI NVS
area was busy. The other problem was buffer size calculation bugs.
Because of it, TPM CRB driver requested larger than the size ACPI
table described. So, TPM CRB driver also couldn't map command and
response buffers even though the reserved area was not busy.

It seems that my separated patches could handle those two problems and
enable AMD's fTPM in any case.

Seunghun
