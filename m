Great, other important thing if we did decide to go this route is there
must be some devices with multiple strings on day 1 (such as the cie-1991
example above).

Whatever we say the ABI is, if we end up with established userspace
components that strcmp("linear", ...) and there are no early counter
examples then we could get stuck without the option to add more
precise tokens as we learn more.

Good point.

Any clue whether the tables are "stupid" (e.g. offer a poor user experience
with notchy feeling backlight response) or whether they work because
some of the downstream componentry has a non-linear response?

If we have an "unknown" and we don't know then I guess I just claimed
that's what we have to do for cases we don't understand.

For pwm_bl it would be easy to study the table and calculate how far from the
line the centre point is... although that bringing back heuristics into
the picture, albeit more useful ones.

As I said... I'd be OK for the pwm_bl to take a few liberties because it
is so different from the fully fledged LED driver drivers but we don't
need to go crazy ;-)
