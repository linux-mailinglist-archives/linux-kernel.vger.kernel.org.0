Dear Friend,

Greetings to you in the name of God, I=E2=80=99m Mrs Awuta Mamma and I
have been suffering from ovarian cancer disease and the doctor says
that I have just few days to leave.
I from (Paris) France, but based in Africa Burkina Faso since eight
years ago as a business woman dealing with gold exportation and cotton
Sales.
Now that I am about to end the race like this, without any family
members and no child, I have $5.8 Million US Dollars in here in
Burkina Faso in the BANK, already I have instructed the Bank to give
St Andrews Missionary and Home Kizito Orphanage in Burkina Faso. But
my mind is not at rest; because I am afraid they may not do so and sit
upon the money if I died,
It is the reason why I order them to stop and wish to contact you now
through the help of a nurse with computer beside my sick bed.
I have instructed the bank to transfer the fund to you as a foreigner,
that will apply to the bank after I have gone that they should release
the fund to you, but you will assure me that you will take 50% of the
fund and give 50% to the orphanages home in your country for my heart
to rest in peace.
Respond to me immediately for further details since I have just few
days to end my life due to the ovarian cancer disease, hoping you will
understand my situation and give favorable attention.
Thank you and God bless you,

Mrs Awuta Mamma
