Brijesh and Tom, we currently hit this any time we boot an SEV enabled 
Ubuntu 18.04 guest; I assume that guest kernels, especially those of such 
major distributions, are expected to work with warnings and BUGs when 
certain drivers are enabled.

If the vmap purge lock is to remain a mutex (any other reason that 
unmapping aliases can block?) then it appears that allocating a dmapool 
is the only alternative.  Is this something that you'll be addressing 
generically or do we need to get buy-in from the maintainers of this 
specific driver?
