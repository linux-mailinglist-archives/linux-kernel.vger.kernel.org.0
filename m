You can pretend that the page table is on the stack. See the _pmd
variable in do_huge_pmd_wp_page_fallback() and
__split_huge_zero_page_pmd(). Similarly, the vma and even the mm can be
faked on the stack (see the arm64 tlb_flush()).

I find this very confusing (not your fault, just the semantics expected
by the core code). I can see that x86 is using _PAGE_PSE to make
pmd_present(pmd_mknotpresent()) == true. However, for pud that's not the
case (because it's not used for transhuge).

I'd rather have this renamed to pmd_mknotvalid().

I wonder if we can encode this safely for arm64 in the bottom two bits
of a pmd :

0b00 - not valid, not present
0b10 - not valid, present, huge
0b01 - valid, present, huge
0b11 - valid, table (not huge)

Do we ever call pmdp_invalidate() on a table entry? I don't think we do.

So a pte_mknotvalid would set bit 1 and I think swp_entry_to_pmd() would
have to clear it so that pmd_present() actually returns false for a swp
pmd entry.

I'd really like the mknotpresent to be renamed to mknotvalid and then we
can keep pmdp_invalidate unchanged (well, calling mknotvalid instead).
