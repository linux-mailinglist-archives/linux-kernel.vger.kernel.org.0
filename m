Hmm, so this is interesting. Does that mean we could do a local I-cache
invalidation in check_and_switch_context() at the same as doing the local
TLBI after a rollover?

I still don't grok the failure case, though, because assuming A77 has IDC=0,
then won't you see the I-cache maintenance from userspace anyway?
