That might be true of the expiry on entering tick_nohz_restart(), but it
shouldn't be true of ts->last_tick which the expiry is set to before callin=
g
hrtimer_forward() -- and if it were, hrtimer_forward() is a no-op when the
expiry is in the future.

BTW, the name "last_tick" seems misleading as it's actually the saved
expiry, not the last time the tick ran.
