Hehe was just a side effect of testing the cpu hotplug stuff :-)

Nope. It just happened while trying to stress the cpu hotplug series I just
posted.

It's 5.6-rc6, sorry should have mentioned in the report.

		/* Cycle through nesting levels of rcu_expedite_gp() calls. */
		if (can_expedite &&
		    !(torture_random(&rand) & 0xff & (!!expediting - 1))) {
			WARN_ON_ONCE(expediting == 0 && rcu_gp_is_expedited());
			if (expediting >= 0)
				rcu_expedite_gp();
			else
				rcu_unexpedite_gp();
			if (++expediting > 3)
				expediting = -expediting;
		} else if (!can_expedite) { /* Disabled during boot, recheck. */

If it's something you don't care about, then I don't care about too. I just
thought I'd report it in case it uncovered something worthwhile.

Thanks!
