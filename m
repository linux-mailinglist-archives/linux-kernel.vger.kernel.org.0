There's only 8 files referencing panel-common.txt which was why I was
debating just converting all of them.

I have a doc2yaml script that helps with some of the boilerplate. It's
in my yaml-bindings-v2 branch[1].

That would be ideal, but not strictly required. For pending things, no
reason to make folks redo things. Requiring schema really depends on
whomever is applying things to run at least 'make dt_binding_check'
