The direction that Peter, Mathieu and Steve are going is that callbacks
registered on "rcu idle" tracepoints need to turn on "RCU watching"
themselves. Such as perf. Turning on "RCU watching" is non-free as I tested
in 2017 and we removed it back then, but it was added right back when perf
started splatting. Now it is being removed again, and the turning on of RCU's
eyes happens in the perf callback itself since perf uses RCU.

If you are calling trace_.._rcuidle(), can you not ensure that RCU is
watching by calling the appropriate RCU APIs in your callbacks? Or did I miss
the point?
