Hi,

Looking at tty-next I notice that you're right. When I started working
on this I only found the stuff from 2018 I linked to but didn't imagine
that in that exact moment someone else would also work on that area.

So no worries, I'll adapt my code ;-)

Thanks for the pointers and also doing all that ground work :-)

I'm fine either way - maybe I also get a pointer on what may be a better
approach ;-)

At least DTR as "Data Terminal Ready" did sound somewhat matching for
the "Receive Enable" of RS485 (and it's also the only other output pin
in the mctrl gpio list).
