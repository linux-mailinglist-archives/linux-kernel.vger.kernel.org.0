 Panfrost driver itself - it doesn't have any knowledge of what to do with =
these power domains. The naming of the domains looks suspiciously like some=
one thought that e.g. only half of the cores could be powered, but it doesn=
't look like that was implemented in the chromeos driver linked and anyway =
that is *meant* to be automatic in the hardware! (I.e. if you only power up=
 one cores in one core stack then the PDC should only enable the power doma=
in for that set of cores).
