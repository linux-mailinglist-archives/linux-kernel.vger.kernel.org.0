The CvP case is the same as III) Thomas' case. The FPGA configuration 
bitstream is downloaded over the PCIe.

The one difference in my case is that there isn't an SoC. This is a 
Intel host processor connecting to a non-SoC Stratix10/Arria10. The 
non-SoC A10/S10, boots a minimal image (CvP) setting up the peripheral 
pins and enabling the PCIe endpoint for CvP downloads.

The host can then download bitstreams using the FPGA Manager through 
debugFS and when the bitstream finishes downloading and the FPGA enters 
User Mode, the functionality is available for the host to use.

Understood. I'm still coming up to speed on the variations of FPGA 
enablement but I'm happy to help where I can.
