Could you provide regular (e.g. each second) snapshots of /proc/vmstat,
ideally started before and finished after the observed behavior?
Something like
while true
do
	cp /proc/vmstat vmstat.$(date +%s)
done

If you can perf record and see where the kernel spends time during that
time period then it would be really helpful as well.

Your patch might be simply papering over a real problem.
