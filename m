I have no idea whether or not you were on CC in the earlier thread.

As in remove the leading "sched_" from the function names?  (The names
were already there, so I left them be.)

As in sched_tick_remote(), right?

> 	state = atomic_read(->state);
> 	if (state) {

You sure you don't want "if (state != RUNNING)"?  But I guess you need
to understand that RUNNING==0 to understand the atomic_inc_not_zero().

> 		WARN_ON_ONCE(state != OFFLINING);
> 		if (atomic_inc_not_zero(->state))

This assumes that there cannot be concurrent calls to sched_tick_remote(),
otherwise, you can end up with ->state==3.  Which is a situation that
my version does a WARN_ON_ONCE() for, so I guess the only difference is
that mine would be guaranteed to complain and yours would complain with
high probability.  So fair enough!

There cannot be a sched_tick_stop() or sched_tick_stop(), but there really
can be a sched_tick_remote() right here in the absence of stop-machine,
can't there?  Or am I missing something other than stop-machine that
prevents this?

Now, you could argue that concurrency is safe: Either sched_tick_remote()
sees RUNNING and doesn't touch the value, or it sees offlining and
sched_tick_stop() makes no further changes, but I am not sure that
this qualifies as simpler...

> 	WARN_ON_ONCE(state != RUNNING);
> 	atomic_set(->state, OFFLINING);

Another option would be to use atomic_xchg() as below instead of the
atomic_read()/atomic_set() pair.  Would that work for you?

This one looks to be an improvement on mine regardless of the other two.
