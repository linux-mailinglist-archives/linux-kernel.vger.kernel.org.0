Just picking up on this as "someone from ARM".

The yield instruction in our implementation of cpu_relax() is *only* there
as a scheduling hint to QEMU so that it can treat it as an internal
scheduling hint and run some other thread; see 1baa82f48030 ("arm64:
Implement cpu_relax as yield"). We can't use WFE or WFI blindly here, as it
could be a long time before we see a wake-up event such as an interrupt. Our
implementation of smp_cond_load_acquire() is much better for that kind of
thing, but doesn't help at all for a contended CAS loop where the variable
is actually changing constantly.

Implementing yield in the CPU may generally be beneficial for SMT designs so
that the hardware resources aren't wasted when spinning round a busy loop.
For this particular discussion (i.e. lockref), however, it seems as though
the cpu_relax() call is questionable to start with.
