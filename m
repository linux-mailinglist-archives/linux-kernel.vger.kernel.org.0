I forgot but is there a chance to have this as a per-taskgroup attribute
as well?

This can definitely be useful for Android/EAS by replacing the current
proprietary solution in android-google-common android-5.4:

commit 760b82c9b88d ("ANDROID: sched/fair: Bias EAS placement for latency")
commit c28f9d3945f1 ("ANDROID: sched/core: Add a latency-sensitive flag
to uclamp")

which links to usercase 6 (EAS) in [1].
