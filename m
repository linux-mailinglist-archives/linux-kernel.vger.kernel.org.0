Woohoo! So I finally got something right about this :) I'd be up for
including the diagrams above either in the commit message or in the IOMMU
driver code, along with a comment saying that region 'A' cannot be mapped
by the IOMMU and that the page-table walker uses CPU physical addresses.

Got it. Thanks.

Up to you. If you want to fix the current mainline behaviour of always
setting bit 4, then that should be a separate patch at the start of the
series which can be backported to stable. Is there a reason this doesn't go
wrong in practice?

Hmm. I would prefer that the iopgtable code:

	* Range checks the paddr against the oas in ->map()
	* Refuses to accept an oas > 32 in ->alloc()

Then it's up to you whether you just want to pass an oas of 34 from the
IOMMU driver.
