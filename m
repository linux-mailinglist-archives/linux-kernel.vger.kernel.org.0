All the ringbuffer code assumes that the use of index numbers handles
the ABA problem (i.e. there must not be 1 billion printk's within an
NMI). If we want to support 1 billion+ printk's within an NMI, then
perhaps the index number should be increased. For 64-bit systems it
would be no problem to go to 62 bits. For 32-bit systems, I don't know
how well the 64-bit atomic operations are supported.

I need to go through the code again in detail and see how many locations
are affected by ABA. All the code was written with the assumption that
this type of ABA will not happen.

As you've stated, we could add minimal handling so that the ringbuffer
at least does not break or get stuck.

BTW: The same assumption is made for logical positions. There are 4
times as many of these (on 32-bit systems) but logical positions advance
much faster. I will review these as well.
