I agree that the 2nd part about embargo timelines is redundant, but I
only addressed it because the document was already addressing embargos.

I only now realized that the link we had there was just going to the
main wiki page by mistake: the tag it was trying to point to was removed
from the wiki page. We should probably update that too.

With regards to the explicit instruction to agree with policies, I think
we do need it there. Right now this section reads as "for embargoes work
with linux-distros@vs.openwall.org, and btw they have a wiki which you
may or may not need to read".

We probably do need to stress here that linux-distros has different
policies than security@kernel.org.
