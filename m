> Arbitrary decisions made (yell if you want changed):
> - Left all the older devices (where clocks / clock-names weren't

> - Didn't make clocks "required" for msm8996 but left them as listed.
>   This seems a little weird but it matches the old binding.
>=20
> Misc cleanups as part of this patch:
> - Fixed schema id to not have "bindings/" as per Rob [1].
> - Listed include files as per Stephen.
> - sm8150 was claimed to be same set of clocks as sc7180, but driver
>   and dts appear to say that "bi_tcxo_ao" doesn't exist.  Fixed.
> - In "apq8064", "#thermal-sensor-cells" was missing the "#".
> - Got rid of "|" at the end of top description since spacing doesn't
>   matter.
> - Changed indentation to consistently 2 spaces (it was 3 in some
>   places).
> - Added period at the end of protected-clocks description.
> - No space before ":".
> - Updated sc7180/sm8150 example to use the 'qcom,rpmh.h' include.
> - Updated sc7180/sm8150 example to use larger address/size cells as
>   per reality.
> - Updated sc7180/sm8150 example to point to the sleep_clk rather than
>   <0>.
> - Made it so that gcc-ipq8074 didn't require #power-domain-cells since
>   actual dts didn't have it and I got no hits from:
>     git grep _GDSC include/dt-bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-ipq8074.h

>=20
> Noticed, but not done in this patch (volunteers needed):
> - Add "aud_ref_clk" to sm8150 bindings / dts even though I found a
>   reference to it in "gcc-sm8150.c".
> - Fix node name in actual ipq8074 to be "clock-controller" (it's gcc).
> - Since the example doesn't need phandes to exist, in msm8998 could
>   just make up places providing some of the clocks currently bogused
>   out with <0>.
> - On msm8998 clocks are listed as required but current dts doesn't
