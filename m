You don't find listing 1 simpler than listing 2? It does save one
register, as it doesn't have to keep track of done independently from
bytes. This is always going to be the case unless the compiler can
eliminate done by transforming Listing 2 into Listing 1. Unfortunately,
even if it gets much smarter, it's unlikely to be able to do that,
because they're equivalent only if there is no overflow, so it would
need to know that bytes + iter->bi_bvec_done cannot overflow, and that
iter->bi_bvec_done must be smaller than cur->bv_len initially.

Listing 1:

	bytes += iter->bi_bvec_done;
	while (bytes) {
		const struct bio_vec *cur = bv + idx;

		if (bytes < cur->bv_len)
			break;
		bytes -= cur->bv_len;
		idx++;
	}

	iter->bi_idx = idx;
	iter->bi_bvec_done = bytes;

Listing 2:

	while (bytes) {
		const struct bio_vec *cur = bv + idx;
		unsigned int len = min(bytes, cur->bv_len - done);

		bytes -= len;
		done += len;
		if (done == cur->bv_len) {
			idx++;
			done = 0;
		}
	}

	iter->bi_idx = idx;
	iter->bi_bvec_done = done;
