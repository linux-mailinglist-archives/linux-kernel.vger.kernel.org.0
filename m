What if the allocation requires the kernel to swap some old pages out 
to the backing store, but the backing store is on the device that the 
driver is managing?  The swap can't take place until the current I/O 
operation is complete (assuming the driver can handle only one I/O 
operation at a time), and the current operation can't complete until 
the old pages are swapped out.  Result: deadlock.

Isn't that the whole reason for using GFP_NOIO in the first place?
