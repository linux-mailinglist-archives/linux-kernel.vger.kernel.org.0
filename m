We could default to iommu_platform=3Don on s390 when the host has active
support for protected virtualization... but that's just another kind of
horrible, so let's just pretend I didn't suggest it.

Now, that's 'helpful' -- this certainly calls out for a bit of doc...

Hopefully, the documentation can be changed to something that is _not_
harder to comprehend :) (with a bit more text, I suppose.) Renaming to
something like access_platform seems like a good idea, even with the
required compat dance.

More documentation is never a bad idea; but I'm afraid I don't have any
further insights at the moment.
