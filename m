Just a rushed FYI without looking at your patch or comments.

Internally (in Google) we do rely on good tmpfs inode numbers more
than on those of other get_next_ino() filesystems, and carry a patch
to mm/shmem.c for it to use 64-bit inode numbers (and separate inode
number space for each superblock) - essentially,

=09ino =3D sbinfo->next_ino++;
=09/* Avoid 0 in the low 32 bits: might appear deleted */
=09if (unlikely((unsigned int)ino =3D=3D 0))
=09=09ino =3D sbinfo->next_ino++;

Which I think would be faster, and need less memory, than IDA.
But whether that is of general interest, or of interest to you,
depends upon how prevalent 32-bit executables built without
__FILE_OFFSET_BITS=3D64 still are these days.
