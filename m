I was pretty sure it'd turn out to be worthless, cheers for
confirming ;)

I forgot about the old VGA mode parameters. Have had trouble
(read: zero luck) getting a high-res console for this VM from grub
through to kernel boot since it was provisioned, but I'll give the
above a shot once I've got the disc images safely backed up.

Have gleaned a small nugget more of stack which might help
down the road if this turns out to be VirtualBox-specific: I'm
reliably seeing "vbg_*" (drivers/virt/vboxguest/) stack frames
very early in the oops but they're scrolling way too fast for me
to snap a photo with my mobile. Maybe stack corruption,
maybe not. Pretty sure the VM is using mainline vboxguest.

Anyway, I'll try and glean as much info as I can with vga= and /
or delayed "printk()".

Should note in case the Oracle devs see this, this is a Win 10 Pro
host, 2019 Core i7, running VirtualBox 6.x. I'll haul this bug 'report'
upstream if further analysis points to vboxguest.

Cheers,
Francis
