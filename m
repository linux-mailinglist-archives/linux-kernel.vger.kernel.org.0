The current error message is quite limited in its usefulness - mostly
you have to be able to google the message and hope to hit a previous
report which explains the problem, or find someone on IRC who remembers
the problem, etc.

Could we put a text doc in the kernel tree explaining the problem in
enough detail that people can identify their next steps to resolve it,
and then make this error message tell people to read that text doc.

Regards,
Daniel
