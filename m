I decided this part could use some improvement.  Here is the updated
text:


To this end, the LKMM imposes three extra restrictions, together
called the "plain-coherence" axiom because of their resemblance to the
rules used by the operational model to ensure cache coherence (that
is, the rules governing the memory subsystem's choice of a store to
satisfy a load request and its determination of where a store will
fall in the coherence order):

	If R and W conflict and it is possible to link R to W by one
	of the xb* sequences listed above, then W ->rfe R is not
	allowed (i.e., a load cannot read from a store that it
	executes before, even if one or both is plain).

	If W and R conflict and it is possible to link W to R by one
	of the vis sequences listed above, then R ->fre W is not
	allowed (i.e., if a store is visible to a load then the load
	must read from that store or one coherence-after it).

	If W and W' conflict and it is possible to link W to W' by one
	of the vis sequences listed above, then W' ->co W is not
	allowed (i.e., if one store is visible to a second then the
	second must come after the first in the coherence order).
