Hooking it into the TOC tree is a good thing, but I think it's also good
to think about the exercise in general.  This is a document dropped into
place five years ago and never touched again.  It's a short list of
seemingly ancient laptops with no explanation of what it means.  So the
real question, IMO, is whether this document is useful to anybody and, if
not, whether it should just be deleted instead.

Puranjay, thanks for working to improve the kernel docs!  Please don't be
discouraged by this response - it's just a sign that kernel documentation
has problems far beyond just formatting...

Thanks,

jon
