Yes but that adds additional complexity and considerations which made me 
think that lookup was the by far simplest choice:

- We need to modify the vma manager to care about alignments.
- Fragmentation issues. Do we want to align > 1G BOs
- For which drivers do we want to do this, how do we handle drivers that 
want to opt out in TTM mmap()?
- Non TTM drivers. Could they still reuse the same get_unmapped_area.

So is that an ack?
