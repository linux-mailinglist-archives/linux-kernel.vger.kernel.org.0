We don't really have a way to say a binding can only occur once or N
times in a DT. We'd have to have an SoC schema that listed out all the
nodes in the DT and forbid any additional nodes. I don't think that's
too useful as if there's only 1 instance for a given schema, then the
schema is not too useful as the schema has a equal chance of being
wrong.

Is there something inherent about the h/w that prevents more than one
instance? If support of more than one instance is a kernel limitation
(because no current SoC needs more than 1), then shouldn't the kernel
protect against this?
