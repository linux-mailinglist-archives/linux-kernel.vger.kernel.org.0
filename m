Yes, sadly it's the only source of storage I have on that device.

When I ran the test I had swapoff, as you can see in the snippet below. When
swap is on I do hibernate and wakeup successfully. At least that's what appears
to be happening to me.

I get a similar splat regardless of swap is on or off.
