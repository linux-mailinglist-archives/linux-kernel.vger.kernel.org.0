So I started this and discovered the nice joke you were telling me
about regarding FD_IOPORT which references fdc. Then the address
registers FD_STATUS, FD_DATA, FD_DOR, FD_DIR, FD_DCR which are
based on FD_IOPORT also depend on it.

These ones are used by fd_outb() which is arch-dependent, so if we
want to pass a third argument we have to change them all and make sure
not to break them too much.

In addition the FD_* macros defined above are used by x86, and FD_DOR is
also used by arm while all other archs hard-code all the values. ARM also
uses floppy_selects[fdc] and new_dor... I'm starting to feel the trap here!
I also feel a bit concerned that these are exported in uapi with a hard-coded
0x3f0 base address. I'm just not sure how portable all of this is in
the end :-/

Now I'm wondering, how far should we go and how much is it acceptable to
change ? I'd rather not have "#define fdc current_fdc" just so that it
builds, but on the other hand this problem clearly outlights the roots
of the issue, which lies in "fdc" being silently accessed by macros with
nobody noticing!
