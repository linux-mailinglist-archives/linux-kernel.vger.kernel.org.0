Yeah, and now I'm in, too. I'd really like to have an useful
phone. Droid4 seems like best candidate.

Are you ready for the crazyness?

There are two modems in droid 4. I don't care about the LTE one. The
GSM one is connected with few USB channels, and few multiplexed
channels over UART.

One of USB channels is standard AT commands.
One of USB channels is QMI.
But using USB means big power consumption, so it is better to use
multiplexed channels over UART.

Few of those look vaguely like AT commands, but voice and sms and
=2E.. are going over separate channels. One of those contains NMEA data
(packet in AT lookalike).

Userspace should be shielded from hardware-specific mess :-(.

These "Motorola AT" commands are really a bit different from standard
AT commands. I was working on userspace, and got something... but
could not get SMSes to work.

We'd really like unified interface for the GPS receivers, please. In
the Droid4 case, there's separate channel on the UART that has just
the GPS... so it is really quite similar to normal GPS.

We won't have proper driver for the modem anytime soon, but it would
be good to be able to use the GPS in the meantime.
