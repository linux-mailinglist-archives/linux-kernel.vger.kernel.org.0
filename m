Hi,

For reference, which CPUs are in those SoCs?

The differing fields are EL3, EL2, and EL1: the boot CPU supports
AArch64 and AArch32 at those exception levels, while the secondary only
supports AArch64.

Do we handle this variation in KVM?

The differing field is (AArch32) SMC: present on the boot CPU, but
missing on the secondary CPU.

This is mandated to be zero when AArch32 isn' implemented at EL1.

The differing fields are (AArch32) Virtualization, Security, and
ProgMod: all present on the boot CPU, but missing on the secondary
CPU.

All mandated to be zero when AArch32 isn' implemented at EL1.

The differing fields are:

* IDC: present only on the secondary CPU. This is a worrying mismatch
  because it could mean that required cache maintenance is missed in
  some cases. Does the secondary CPU definitely broadcast PoU
  maintenance to the boot CPU that requires it?

* L1Ip: VIPT on the boot CPU, PIPT on the secondary CPU.

The differing field is IESB: presend on the boot CPU, missing on the
secondary CPU.

These are the same story as for SM8150.

Before we make any changes, we need to check whether we do actually
handle this variation in a safe way, and we need to consider what this
means w.r.t. late CPU hotplug.

Even if we can handle variation at boot time, once we've determined the
set of system-wide features we cannot allow those to regress, and I
believe we'll need new code to enforce that. I don't think it's
sufficient to mark these as NONSTRICT, though we might do that with
other changes.

We shouldn't look at the part number at all here. We care about
variation across CPUs regardless of whether this is big.LITTLE or some
variation in tie-offs, etc.

Thanks,
Mark.
