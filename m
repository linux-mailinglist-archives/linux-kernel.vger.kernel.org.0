Oh, yes, that is true, you also can't rely on the struct file living
longer than the HW objects either, that isn't how the lifetime model
works.

If GUP consumes the struct file it must allow the struct file to be
deleted before the GUP pin is released.

For RDMA the obvious context is the struct ib_mr *

Is this all just for debugging? Seems like a lot of complication just
to print a string

Generally, I think you'd be better to associate things with the
mm_struct not some struct file... The whole design is simpler as GUP
already has the mm_struct.
