So there's a whole bunch of daemons doing desktop notifications along with a
desktop notifications spec, yadda yadda:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_notifications

but installing an openSUSE Leap 15.1 in a guest and that is a default
desktop installation doesn't give me any notifications. I installed
notification-daemon and whatnot but nada.

Which means, that we cannot guarantee that every user would see it.
There might be installations which miss it.

So the only thing I can think of right now is to make that single line
pr_emerg() so that it atleast spews into the terminals when suspending:

linux-6qfo:~ # echo "suspend" > /sys/power/disk
linux-6qfo:~ # echo "mem" > /sys/power/state

<--- resume guest.

Assuming the user has at least a single terminal open. But someone might
have a better idea.
