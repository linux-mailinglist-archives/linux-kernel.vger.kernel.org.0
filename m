So these two issues are addressed by the logic implemented in sd-boot
(systemd's boot loader) like this:

The old seed is read off the ESP seed file. We then calculate two hash
sums in counter mode from it (SHA256), one we pass to the OS as seed
to initialize the random pool from. The other we use to update the ESP
seed file with. Unless you are capable of breaking SHA256 this means
the seed passed to the OS and the new seed stored on disk are derived
from the same seed but in a way you cannot determine one if you
managed to learn the other. Moreover, on each boot you are guaranteed
to get two new seeds, each time, and you cannot derive the sums used
on previous boots from those. This means we are robust towards
potential seed reuse when turning the system forcibly off during boot.

Now, what's still missing in the above is protection against "golden
image" issues, as you correctly pointed out. To deal with that the
SHA256 sums are not just hashed from the old seed and the counter, but
also include a system specific "system token" (you may also call it
"salt") which is stored in an EFI variable, persistently, which was
created once, during system installation. This hence gives you the
behaviour your are looking for, using the NVRAM like you suggested,
but we don't need to write the EFI vars all the time, as instead we
update the seed file stored in the ESP each time, and updating the ESP
should be safer and less problematic (i.e. if everything is done right
it's a single sector write).

To make this safer, on EFI firmwares that support the RNG protocol we
also include some data derived from that in the hash, just for good
measure. To sumarize:

NEWDISKSEED = SHA256(OLDDISKSEED || SYSTEMTOKEN || EFIRNGVAL || "1")
SEEDFORLINUX = SHA256(OLDDISKSEED || SYSTEMTOKEN || EFIRNGVAL || "2")

(and no, this is not a crypto scheme I designed, but something
Dr. Bertram Poettering (my brother, a cryptographer) suggested)

Well, the kernel cannot hash and rewrite the old seed file early enough,
it's that simple. It can do that only when /var becomes writable,
i.e. very late during boot, much later than when we need entropy
for. The boot loader on the hand, can hash and rewrite the old seed
file even before the kernel initializes, and that's the big benefit!

So, you could, but don't have to update the ESP random seed file from
the OS too, every now and then, but the security of the model dos not
rely on that.

(And yes, the above doesn't help if you have a fully R/O medium, but
those tend to be embedded devices, and I am much less concerned about
those, the designers really can deal with the RNG seed issues
themselves, and maybe provide some hw to do it; it's the generic user
PCs that we should be concerned about, and for those the above should
generally work)
