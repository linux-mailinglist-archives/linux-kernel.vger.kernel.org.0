I think (but didn't grep) that we actually export sum_exec_runtime in
/proc/ *somewhere*.

There are no raw cpu_times, there are system and user samples, and
samples are, by their very nature, an approximation. We just happen to
track the samples in TICK_NSEC resolution these days, but they're still
ticks (except on s390 and maybe other archs, which do time accounting in
the syscall path).

But I think you'll find x86 people are quite opposed to doing TSC reads
in syscall entry and exit :-)
