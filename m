Right. There is nothing wrong with these two messages coming after each
other. They are both correct and due to the ordering they also make sense.

CPU is vulnerable and then the next printk tells that mitigation is in
effect. So really nothing to worry about.

The important part is that the ordering of these messages is correct which
is the case and that the sysfs file corresponds with the last printk.

We really have more urgent problems than bikeshed painting these printks.
