Maybe i have lost my email.

Luckly, it's good chance for me to redisigned pstore/blk and blkoops.
Pstore/blk can now support full recorders of pstore, including console
and ftrace. Besides, there is a series
of patches to make MTD device work on pstore.

Let's drop the old patches of pstore/blk. I will send new patches a few
days later.
