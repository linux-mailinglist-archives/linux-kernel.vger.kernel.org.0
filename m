Good point. I too prefer code that's understandable by mere mortals.

Given that, and the fact that Neil pointed out that yangerkun's latest
patch would reintroduce the original race, I'm leaning back toward the
patch Neil sent yesterday. It relies solely on spinlocks, and so doesn't
have the subtle memory-ordering requirements of the others.

I did some cursory testing with it and it seems to fix the performance
regression. If you guys are OK with this patch, and Neil can send an
updated changelog, I'll get it into -next and we can get this sorted
out.

Thanks,
