The fsck should have fixed layout problem, that's just unnecessary message, we
can avoid it by relocating sanity check of layout.

I've sent one patch for that, and tested with it, it acts as expected. :)

Since v1 was upstreamed in 5.2-rc1, I guess we need another patch for that,
maybe in below patch?
