So what are the practical differences between using CONFIG_HZ=100 and
1000 for dummy-hcd? Is is going to be slower or faster? Or can it get
overloaded with data and cause stalls? Or something else? We're
somewhat hesitant to change CONFIG_HZ as we don't know how it will
affect other parts of the kernel (at some point the USB fuzzer will
become a part of the main syzbot instance that doesn't only fuzz USB).
