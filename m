Just to make sure I understand - if AMUs are physically present but not
enabled by FW, we'll still
- see them as implemented in ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.AMU
- see some counters as available with e.g. AMCGCR_ELO.CG0NC > 0

But reading some AMEVCNTR<g><n> will return 0?

Yikes

I haven't seen something that would try to catch this on the kernel side.
Can we try to detect that (e.g. at least one counter returns > 0) in
cpu_amu_enable() and thus not write to the CPU-local 'amu_feat'?

While we're on the topic of detecting broken stuff, what if some CPUs
implement some auxiliary counters that some others don't?

Nit: Or be a superset of the above, right? AIUI v1 only mandates the lower
4 bits to be set. Probably doesn't matter that much...
