Ok, I see what you are getting at but I worry there are multiple
problems there. First, the nr_busy_cpus is decremented only when a CPU
is entering idle with the tick stopped. If nohz is disabled then this
breaks, no? Secondly, a CPU can be idle but the tick not stopped if
__tick_nohz_idle_stop_tick knows there is an event in the near future
so using busy_cpus, we potentially miss a sibling that was adequate
for running a task. Finally, the threshold for cutting off the search
entirely seems low. The patch marks a domain as overloaded if there are
twice as many running tasks as runqueues scanned. In that scenario, even
if tasks are rapidly switching between busy/idle, it's still unlikely
the task will go idle. When cutting off at just the fully-busy mark, we
could miss a CPU that is going idle, almost idle or is running SCHED_IDLE
tasks where are acceptable target candidates for select_idle_sibling. I
think there are too many cases where nr_busy_cpus are problematic to
make it a good alternative.
