I agree that "missing GNU_STACK" is not the same than GNU_STACK=3D=3DRWX =
and=20
this should be handled differently. There is a clear security benefit
if we don't assume that GNU_STACK=3D=3DRWX means more than that.

My initial patch intended to prevent that on modern 64-bit programs where=

explicitly marked executable stack, they are forced to have the=20
READ_IMPLIES_EXEC state when no such thing is needed.

The read-implies-exec could be used via personality, so, such unlikely=20
applications executing memory that it had not explicit marked as executab=
le,=20
could just use the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality, right?=20

Adding a flag to prevent the core mm to call the driver with VM_EXEC can =
prevent [1].
So, I'm completely fine the "first" change.

This "second" change only affects "missing GNU_STACK" programs. So both, =
the
benefits and the risks are only for ancient applications. So, this is not=
 a bid
deal, I would go for apply this "second" change. Maybe I'm missing someth=
ing,
but why we can't use personalities for x86_64 ancient binaries that expec=
t to
execute any memory? Again, we can add a flag to prevent the core mm to ca=
ll the
driver with VM_EXEC.

Also as you pointed out, if there are backed files on a nonexec-filesyste=
ms,
then should we remove the "x" to reflect reality?=20

If we want to reflect reality, then there are other things we are missing=
=2E
For example on i386, a write-only memory region can be read. So, if we
have a "write-only" memory region, should we expect "rw-" in systems with=
 NX
and "rwx" in systems that lacks NX? There are probably others situations =
I'm
not considering here.

I'm not sure about the unseen issues that doing this can introduce but if=

we want to reflect reality, why we shouldn't do the same for others=20
permissions? I am not sure that it worth to it just for cosmetic reasons.=
