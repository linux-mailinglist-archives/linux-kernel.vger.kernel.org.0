So I'm pretty sure we *do* want tasks with the default clamps to get iowait
boost'd. What we don't want are background tasks driving up the frequency,
and that should be via uclamp.max (as Quentin is suggesting) rather than
uclamp.min (as is suggested in the patch).

Now, whether that is overloading the usage of uclamp... I'm not sure.
One of the argument for uclamp was actually frequency selection, so if
we just make iowait boost respect that, IOW not boost further than
uclamp.max (which is a bit better than a simple on/off switch), that
wouldn't be too crazy I think.
