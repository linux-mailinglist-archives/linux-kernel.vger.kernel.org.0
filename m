No.

Is what a selector is documented anywhere?  I just looked again and I
haven't found
documentation explaining that a selector is the raw register value.

Now I understand why this driver has the hardware to software selector
translation.
The selector being the raw register value seems to be a very limited
assumption that
I don't see working for more than very basic implementations.

We've already figured out a virtualized selector mapping, I don't want
to reimplement
the complicated math to correctly map a requested voltage range to
what the regulator
can provide, and possibly get it wrong, or at the very least have two duplicate
implementations.

The naming is consistent with the rest of the driver, and the name
seems long enough
already.  Lets just keep this.

Fine.  I'll fix up the get() to return the selector, and not the
voltage since that works better
with everything else that is implemented.

Again, it would be nice if the documentation for regulator_ops
indicated that a driver
should only implement the voltage operations or the selector
operations, not mix and
match if that is your expectation.

Fine.  I'll fix this per what you've stated.

Again, would be nice if the documentation for the API modes clearly indicated
they should match to one specific HW setting incases where the HW doesn't
match the API 1:1.
