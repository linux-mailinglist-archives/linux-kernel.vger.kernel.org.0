Any reason for not start from MSI-X? E.g having MSI-X table and PBA (both=
 of which looks pretty independent).

Aha right, I mis-read the patch. But more questions comes:

1) The association between vq and MSI-X vector is fixed. This means it=20
can't work for a device that have more than 2047 queues. We probably=20
need something similar to virtio-pci to allow a dynamic association.
2) The mask and unmask control is missed

Not directly used but masking/unmasking is widely used in irq subsystem=20
which allows lots of optimizations.

I agree to simplify VMM implementation, but it looks to me introducing=20
masking/pending won't cost too much code in the VMM implementation. Just=20
new type of command for VIRTIO_MMIO_MSI_COMMAND.

Thanks
