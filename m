got it, but ... 
user space program flash_lock/flash_unlock are calling 
mtd_lock() & mtd_unlock().
i.e.,
int mtd_lock(struct mtd_info *mtd, loff_t ofs, uint64_t len)
{
         if (!mtd->_lock)
                 return -EOPNOTSUPP;
         if (ofs < 0 || ofs >= mtd->size || len > mtd->size - ofs)
                 return -EINVAL;
         if (!len)
                 return 0;
         return mtd->_lock(mtd, ofs, len);
}


thanks for your time & comments.
