The code already exists to set a limit to bail out of what is sometimes a needlessly excessive search. Setting that 
based on an integer doesn't seem particularly complex. Now whether that is actually useful is what I'm currently looking at.

Overkill and doesn't play well with cpu cgroup controller.

There is no if. It is a brute force search. There are delays proportional to the search domain size. You can optimize 
the hell of out the brute force, or you use obtained knowledge to bail out early. Getting that knowledge from the user 
is a time honored tradition. :-)
