Hi Greg,

Doing a manual review - still incomplete (just stable/ dir) - and I didn't
try to run the script over ABI file yet - this is what I found so
far[1]: 17 files over 37 needed adjustments (45%).

That trick of detecting a complex file when it finds a ':' and parse the
hole description as a literal block solves most of them.

=46rom the changes below, this file:
	Documentation/ABI/stable/sysfs-driver-mlxreg-io

Found a "creative way" to place the "What:" field avoiding long lines...

At least this one should be fixed, as the parser won't handle its
content right (it won't complain, but the result output will be wrong).

[1] I also added a note at README that files should be ReST-compatible
