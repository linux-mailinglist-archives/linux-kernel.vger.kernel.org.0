Realistically, there will likely be a non-trivial number of systems with
SGX_LE_WR=0 but SGX enabled.

Given the number of steps BIOS needs to take to enable SGX, that'd be one
"inventive" BIOS. :-)

Anyways, adding logic to opportunistically set FEATURE_CONTROL during boot
should be trivial.  I'll prep a patch and send it separately from the SGX
series, moving the existing KVM code would be a good change irrespective
of SGX.

It's inevitable that some systems will lock down the LE hash MSRs, either
intentionally or due to lack of support for SGX_LE_WR.  The latter is
probably going to be more common than OEMs intentionally locking the MSRs,
because some Intel reference BIOSes simply don't support SGX_LE_WR, e.g. I
have a Coffee Lake SDP that has hardware support for SGX_LC, but the BIOS
doesn't provide any way to set SGX_LE_WR or leave FEATURE_CONTROL unlocked.
