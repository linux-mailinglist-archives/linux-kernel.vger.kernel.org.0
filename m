I disagree, there is really no harm in the bridge probing if there is no dsi.

Furthermore, it seems that this change broke a few other drivers.

Unfortunately this is harder than it sounds, since we need to read hw
revision registers for display and dsi blocks to know which hw
revision we are dealing with.

(Also, we need to avoid
drm_fb_helper_remove_conflicting_framebuffers() until we know we are
ready to go.)

We could possibly put more information in dt.  But the less we depend
on dt, the easier time we'll have adding support for ACPI boot on the
windows arm laptops.

yes and no.. the way the existing bridges work with a bridge->attach()
step seems fairly pragmatic to me.

sorry I didn't notice the patch sooner, most of my bandwidth goes to mesa.

kirin isn't the only other user of adv75xx.. at least it is my
understanding that this broke db410c as well.

I guess my strongest / most immediate opinion is to not break other
existing adv75xx bridge users.

Beyond that, I found doing mipi_dsi_attach() in bridge->attach() was
quite convenient to get display handover from efifb work.  And that
was (previously) the way most of the bridges worked.

But maybe there is another way.. perhaps somehow the bridges/panels
could be added as sub-components using the component framework, to
prevent the toplevel drm device from probing until they are ready?
We'd still have the problem that the dsi component wants to be able to
read hw revision before registering dsi host.. but I suppose if CCF
exported a way that we could query whether the interface clk was
already enabled, we could have the clk enable/disable cycle that would
break efifb.
