Ok, I will move the code over to TI driver. We can always bring it back
to core code if more drivers need it.

Actually copy_to() is not used by cfi_cmdset_0002.c, its always
write16() that used to program flash.
This is something I want to extend support to, so as to use DMA for
writes as well because I see that writes seem extremely slow at least on
my platform.

Sorry for confusion, as I said above, we do need to keep write16().
Also, copy_to maps to memcpy_toio in case of simple_map which may not
use 16 bit IO accessors. So write16() cannot be mapped to copy_to()

So we need at least write16(), copy_from() and mostly copy_to() (for
accelerating writes). So, lets keep this simple and have all map ops
including read16() as is.

This will come into play for HyperRAM, not a care about for HyperFlash

For HyperFlash, this would be the only bit that needs to be set for read
along with HF_CMD_CA45 for linear burst.
