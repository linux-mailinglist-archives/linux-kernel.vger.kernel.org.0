Sorry, no.  It happens occasionally that non-fixing patches are merged
during -rc time, mostly because they are supposed to land mainline
during merge window, but missed the window for some reason, like
subsystem maintainers did not send pull request to Linus in time.
Also the patches are only taken in early -rc like rc2.
