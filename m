I thought about this point, and actually came to a personal conclusion
that if I do this as a new driver - then it is better to list all
possible regulators, creating some sort of "skeleton" which people
could then work on if need be. I do agree that at the present moment
the one regulator which is exposed is the one for vsdio, but listing
all possibilities should not hurt. This was my motivation to put them
all into the driver on the first place.

If you believe additional regulator elements should be removed from
this version of the driver - I can clean them up and come up with v2
here.

Agree, this is a valid point. But honestly I would really be surprised
if a user would directly touch something which can burn his silicon to
pieces. Regulators are usually not approached by users; unless they
are really HW engineers and know what they are doing.

This I've already covered above I guess.

> Andrey, may I ask which device you are testing this on?

Sure, I use the original Intel Aero board. It used to have an official
image from Aero team with a heavily patched 4.4.y kernel, but when I
decided to have this updated to the latest stable branch - I've faced
the issue of missing core functionality, which led me to this patch.

You're welcome, and thanks for looking into this!
