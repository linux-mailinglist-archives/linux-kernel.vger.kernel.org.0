The current plan is:

 - the driver sets whatever the device supports, and unless that mask
   is too small to be supportable it will always succeed

Which replaces the previous scheme of:

 - the driver tries to set whatever the device supports.  If there are
   addressing limitation outside the device (e.g. the PCIe root port,
   or the AXI interconnect) that will fail, and the device will set
   a 32-bit mask instead which it assumes will generally work.

Yep, and that is what patch 1/2 should handle by truncating the
dma mask to something that can work.  I don't actually have hardware
I could test this scenario on, though.
