Yes, but still one per module. This raises the question whether
maintainers are willing to cope w/ tons of tiny patches for just
one line - for something that will take quite some time to become
actually useful (doesn't help much if only few drivers support it),
and is only helpful in a few use cases.

And to make it really useful, we also need some way to automatically
derive which other symbols to enable (subsystems, etc), w/o auto-
enabling stuff one doesn't need here. (are the defaults sane for
this usecase ?)

The main problem here, IMHO, is that the kconfig system doesn't really
know what makes up a module (it only knows that something w =y cant
depend on something thats =m).

So it smalls like we'd need some config language that really understands
things like modules, subsystems, arches, etc with their properties and
is used by both kconfig and kbuild. Then we could put all metadata there
instead of the current macro calls. At that point we could also put
things like match tables in here, which would solve the problem of
finding the right driver by hardware descriptions.

But that's really a *big* topic, it's not easy.

Are we still talking about compiling custom kernels ?
(how to do that w/o source code ?)

What else would one need that data, if not compiling a custom kernel
(which in turn needs the source) ?

These two are rather simple. Most times there isn't much variance in
virtual hardware (unless one starts directly mapping in pci or usb
devices ...)

Yes. That's actually pretty much the same usecase (in my case I'd also
have dts, lspci/lsusb output, etc)

But only for a pretty specific usecase. I'm not opposed to this, but
I wonder whether maintainers are willing to accept that stuff for just
that specific usecase.

Usually we have (unless we need to do reverse engineering :o). But it's
a pretty time-consuming task. Especially if the requirements change
several times in the development or lifetime of a specific product.

For example "oh, we now need eth", "naah, we don't wanna use usb
anymore", "let's take a different SoM", ... not that have pretty
orthogonal sets of configs we need to maintain: hardware- and non-
hardware-related ones. And hardware-related ones can fall into different
categories like fixed-attached/onboard vs. hotpluggable ones.

Recently I had a case where the customer requested xattr support, so
I had to enable general xattr support as well as per-filesystem.
Pretty simple, but having lots of those cases quickly sums up. One of
the reasons why I've written my own little config generator.

I think I've already got into a pretty usable state - at least for my
projects. For now only supports a few boards and limited set of
features, but patches are always welcomed :)

Yes, it would need to understand things like conditional definitions
to deduce that certain things need to be enabled first, before certain
drivers become choosable.

The problem w/ dependencies is that there can be different types of
dependencies, as well as different types of software objects. Just
solving the expressions is only a part of the problem.

Good tip, I'll have a look at it.

Unfortunately, we don't have this 1:1 mapping. Often drivers support
different sets of devices, depending on other factors, sometimes sub-
options (eg. different hw versions), sometimes depending on other
subsystems, sometimes arch-specific, etc, etc.

I think we should work towards that, but I doubt we'd reach that goal
anytime soon, and begs the question whether it's really worth all the
effort required for that.

Yes, thought about that, too. For example have syms for selecting whole
boards and features of them - a bit like this:

  --> Preconfigure for specific boards
      --> board A
      --> board B
      ...
  --> Enable board features
      --> Ethernet port
      --> Display
          --> Touch panel
      --> Audio
      ....

BUT: this would turn into maintenance hell, so I dropped that idea.

Yes, but this piece of software first needs to know whether eg. PCI
is available on that HW. Oh, and things like PCI could be a dependency
as well as an feature on its own, depending on how you gonna use it.
(eg. if directly access from userland or VMs).
