I think something that allows the tag to be set may be needed. One of 
the use cases for this is virtualization stacks, where you really want
to be able to keep the higher CPU count and to set up the isolation 
from management processes on the host. 

The current cgroup interface doesn't work for that because it doesn't 
apply the tag to children. We've been unable to fully test it in a virt
setup because our VMs are made of a child cgroup per vcpu.

I was thinking MDS is really the reason for this. L1TF has mitigations but
the only current mitigation for MDS for smt is ... nosmt. 

The current core scheduler implementation, I believe, still has (theoretical?) 
holes involving interrupts, once/if those are closed it may be even less 
attractive.

sched_core_get() too?
