I think this is along the lines of what we need to enable async commit
for mdp5 (but also removing the flush from the atomic-commit path)..
the principle behind the async commit is to do all the atomic state
commit normally, but defer writing the flush bits.  This way, if you
get another async update before the next vblank, you just apply it
immediately instead of waiting for vblank.

But I guess you are on a command mode panel, if I remember?  Which is
a case I didn't have a way to test.  And I'm not entirely about how
kms_funcs->vsync_time() should be implemented for cmd mode panels.

That all said, I think we should first fix what is broken, before
worrying about extending async commit support to mdp5.. which
shouldn't hit the async==true path, due to not implementing
kms_funcs->vsync_time().

What I think is going on is that, in the cmd mode case,
mdp5_wait_flush() (indirectly) calls mdp5_crtc_wait_for_pp_done(),
which waits for a pp-done irq regardless of whether there is a flush
in progress.  Since there is no flush pending, the irq never comes.
But the expectation is that kms_funcs->wait_flush() returns
immediately if there is nothing to wait for.
