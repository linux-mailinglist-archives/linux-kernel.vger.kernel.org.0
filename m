Yes, itâ€™s a good point to both consider cache hotness. We have revised
the implementation to select a better idle CPU in the same sched_domain
of prev_cpu (with the same cache hotness) when the RT task wakeup.

Period load balance should be triggered when current jiffies is behind
rq->next_balance, but rq->next_balance is not often exactly the same
with next tick. 
If cpu_busy, interval = sd->balance_interval * sd->busy_factor, and
interval is clamped by 1 to max_load_balance_interval.
By experiment, in a system with HZ=250, available_cpus = 8, the
max_load_balance_interval = HZ * available_cpus / 10 = 250 * 8 / 10 =
200 jiffies,
It would let rq->next_balance = sd->last_balance + interval, the maximum
interval = 200 jiffies, result in more than 1 sched-tick to migrate a
CFS task.

I think it is minor and reasonable, because CPU1 has triggered idle
balance (when krtatm task is the last task leaving CPU1) to pull the
thread1-6580.
