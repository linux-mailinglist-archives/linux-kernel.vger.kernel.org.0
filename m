Just as an FYI, there was some more discussion around the availablity
and use of bcmp in this LLVM bug which spawned
commit 5f074f3e192f ("lib/string.c: implement a basic bcmp").

https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=41035#c13

I believe this is the proper solution but I am fine with whatever works,
I just want our CI to be green without any out of tree patches again...

Cheers,
Nathan
