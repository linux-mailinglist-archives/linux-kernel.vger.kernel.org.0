I don't think scheduling delay is the only (or dominating) factor of=20
extra latency. Here are some data to show it.=20

I measured IPC (instructions per cycle) of the main workload under=20
different scenarios:

side-load | cpu.headroom | side/cpu.weight  | IPC  =20
----------------------------------------------------
 none     |     0%       |       N/A        | 0.66=20
 ffmpeg   |     0%       |    SCHED_IDLE    | 0.53=20
 ffmpeg   |    20%       |    SCHED_IDLE    | 0.58=20
 ffmpeg   |    30%       |    SCHED_IDLE    | 0.62=20

These data show that the side workload has a negative impact on the=20
main workload's IPC. And cpu.headroom could help reduce this impact. =20

Therefore, while optimizations in the wakeup path should help the=20
latency; cpu.headroom would add _significant_ benefit on top of that.=20

Does this assessment make sense?=20

I could try it with our workload next week (I am at LSF/MM this=20
week). Also, please keep in mind that this test sometimes takes=20
multiple days to setup and run.=20
