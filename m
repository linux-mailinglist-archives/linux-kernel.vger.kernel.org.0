I think neither Aneesh nor myself are going to be able to provide a 
complete answer on the use of hugetlb cgroup today, anybody could be using 
it without our knowledge and that opens up the possibility that combining 
the limits would adversely affect a real system configuration.

If that is a possibility, I think we need to do some due diligence and try 
to deprecate allocation limits if possible.  One of the benefits to 
separate limits is that we can make reasonable steps to deprecating the 
actual allocation limits, if possible: we could add warnings about the 
deprecation of allocation limits and see if anybody complains.

That could take the form of two separate limits or a tunable in the root 
hugetlb cgroup that defines whether the limits are for allocation or 
reservation.

Combining them in the first pass seems to be very risky and could cause 
pain for users that will not detect this during an rc cycle and will 
report the issue only when their distro gets it.  Then we are left with no 
alternative other than stable backports and the separation of the limits 
anyway.
