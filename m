Firmware reports e820 and RMRR in separate structure. The system will 
not work stably
if RMRR is not in the e820 table as reserved type mem and can be used 
for other purposes.
In system engineering phase, I practiced with some kind bugs from BIOS, 
but not yet exactly same as
the one here. Please consider this is a generic patch to avoid 
subsequent failure at runtime.

-EFAULT could be used for address related errors.
For this case, I agree, -EINVAL seems better while
consider it as an input problem from firmware. I will make change.
