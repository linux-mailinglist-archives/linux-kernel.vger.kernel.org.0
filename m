Right, the problem can occur only if it is mis-configured so that the frontend
running guests can attach a large number of devices which is enough to cause
the memory pressure.  I tried to explain it in below paragraph, but seems above
paragraph is a little bit confusing.  I will wordsmith the sentence in the next
version.

Thank you for great suggestions, I will apply those.

Good point!  I will add the note.

Yes, agree that.  My test is just a minimal check for my environment.  I will
note the points and concerns in the commit message.

Yes, as Paul also pointed out and suggested, we should consider a structural
solution in a big picture.  Until the big change is ready, this simple solution
would work as a point fix.

You're right!  I will also remove the prefix for other static variables, too.
