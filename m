5. Extend the sbitmap API to allow for growing the bitmap.  I had a
look at doing that, and it looks hard.  There are a lot of things which
are set up at initialisation and changing them mid-use seems tricky.
Ccing Jens in case he has an opinion.

6. Creating a percpu IDA.  This doesn't seem too hard.  We need a percpu
pointer to an IDA leaf (128 bytes), and a percpu integer which is the
current base for this CPU.  At allocation time, find and set the first
free bit in the leaf, and add on the current base.

If the percpu leaf is full, set the XA_MARK_1 bit on the entry in
the XArray.  Then look for any leaves which have both the XA_MARK_0
and XA_MARK_1 bits set; if there is one, claim it by clearing the
XA_MARK_1 bit.  If not, kzalloc a new one and find a free spot for it
in the underlying XArray.

Freeing an ID is simply ida_free().  That will involve changing the
users of get_next_ino() to call put_ino(), or something.

This should generally result in similar contention between threads as
the current scheme -- accessing a shared resource every 1024 allocations.
Maybe more often as we try to avoid leaving gaps in the data structure,
or maybe less as we reuse IDs.

(I've tried to explain what I want here, but appreciate it may be
inscrutable.  I can try to explain more, or maybe I should just write
the code myself)
