Due to historical reasons, I think kernel-doc must handle a handful of
special cases, as a preprocessor converting old conventions to rst. The
title line, parameters, returns, and some in-line markup for &struct,
etc.

I'm not proposing changing "return:", because it's too widespread.

I *am* questioning everything else that necessitates adding *more*
special casing to handle things that would be easy to do in rst. I think
we should be moving in the other direction, fixing things by removing
special casing where we can. Case in point, "example:" as a section.

Why should we be adding different ways of doing things in the
documentation comments and the documentation files? Not having to do
that was one of the original goals. Unify stuff to one markup. Make
kernel-doc comments in source an extension to the documents under
Documentation/.

BR,
Jani.
