3/7 is the code which overwrites the scheduler default
arch_cpu_thermal_pressure() [include/linux/sched/topology.h]. I see it
more of the engine to drive  thermal pressure tracking in the scheduler.

So all the code in 3/7 only makes sense if HAVE_SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE
is selected by the arch. IMHO, 3/7 and enabling it for Arm/Arm64 should
go in together.

OK, makes sense.
