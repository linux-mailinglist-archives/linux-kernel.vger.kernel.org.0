Well at least Pierre knows that very well :) He is designate Reviewer of

Sure I do agree that this assumes internal knowledge but the contributor
knows the subsystem extremely well and he knows the different parts. For
drive by contributor I agree things would be not that picky :)

Even considering the patch series, some split was even file based and in
this case not done. All I ask is for consistency in the series proposed.

Sure given that this is code cleanup I will split them up and push.
Shouldn't take much of my time.

Thanks for the advise.
