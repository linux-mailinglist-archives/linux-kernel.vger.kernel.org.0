Agree.

Or after introducing another limit like KFREE_MAX_BATCH_FORCE(>=
KFREE_MAX_BATCH):

1. Try to drain it on hitting KFREE_MAX_BATCH as it does.

   On success: Same as now.
   On fail: let ->head grow and drain if possible, until reaching to
            KFREE_MAX_BATCH_FORCE.

3. On hitting KFREE_MAX_BATCH_FORCE, give up batching but handle one by
   one from now on to prevent too many pending requests from being
   queued for batching work.

This way, we can avoid both:

1. too many requests being queued and
2. __call_rcu() bunch of requests within a single kfree_rcu().
