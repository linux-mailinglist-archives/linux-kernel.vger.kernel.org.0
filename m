okay,  it's kind of pity even though our raw NAND controller is capable of 

doing it with no byte is sent over the NAND bus.

As you mentioned that other controllers are not capable of doing it 
reliably 
if no byte is sent over the NAND bus.
if so, does it work by adding a NAND_OP_DUMMY_INSTR ? (as Boris's 
comments)

thanks for your time & comments.

Mason
