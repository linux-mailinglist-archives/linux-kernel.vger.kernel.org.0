Yes, this. So they all more or less have the form:

CPU0		CPU1

		enqueue_waiter()
done = true;
if (waiters)
		for (;;) {
		  if (done)
		    break;

		  ...
		}

		dequeue_waiter()

		do something else again

  wake_up_task
		<gets wakeup>


The wake_q thing made the above much more common, but we've had it
forever.

I had patches that did that on purpose, but no.

It's actually an optimization that we never did because semaphores are
so uncritical :-)

The thing is, by delaying the wakup until after we've released the
spinlock, the waiter will not contend on the spinlock the moment it
wakes.
