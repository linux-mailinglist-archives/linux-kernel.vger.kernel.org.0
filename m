So I wanted to test this but with both my somewhat cleaned up nwl
driver¹ and the nwl driver forward ported from the nxp vendor tree I'm
looking at a black screen with current mainline - while my dcss forward
port gives me nice output on mipi dsi. Do you have a tree that uses mipi
dsi on imx8mq where I could look at to check for differences?

Cheers,
