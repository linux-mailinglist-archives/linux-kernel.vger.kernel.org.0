Hi, Christoph,

I've been looking into this a bit, and while it's possible to make it 
work for fault, (and for single page kmaps of course, since we have the 
kernel virtual address already), I run into problems with vmaps, since 
we basically need to vmap a set of consecutive coherent allocations 
obtained from the coherent pool.

Also, at mmap time, we need in theory to call dma_mmap_prepare() and 
save the page_prot for all attrs we might be using at fault time...

I did some thinking into whether we could perhaps cover all or at least 
the vast majority of architectures and awkward devices more generally 
with a  page prot and a set of pfns. So I looked at how 
remap_pfn_range() and io_remap_pfn_range() was implemented across 
architectures, and it turns out that all archs implementing a special 
io_remap_pfn_range() (sparc and mips) end up calling remap_pfn_range(), 
and that should mean that any arch that's currently capable of doing 
fault() should in principle be capable of using vmf_insert_pfn_prot() 
with a suitable pfn that in most (if not all) cases should be obtainable 
from the kernel virtual address.

So do you think a way forward could perhaps be to have a 
dma_common_get_pfn_sgtable() and add a generic vmap_pfn_prot()?

Thanks,

Thomas
