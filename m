One reason why I keep the array allocation code is because it is simple
and fast. Using a free block in the bucket will be a bit slower. Still
we are just dealing with the first block in the list as long as the size
isn't bigger than MAX_CHAIN_BUCKETS. Now if we need to deal with block
splitting (or even merging), it will be even more slow. Given the fact
that we are holding the graph lock in doing all these. It could have a
visible impact on performance.

That is the primary reason why I intend to allow block splitting only as
the last resort when the chain_hlocks array is running out.

What I am thinking is to allow block splitting only if it has a size
that is at least 2 larger than the desire value. In that way, we will
not produce a fragment that is less than 2 in size. The down side is
that we have fewer viable candidates for splitting.
