Thanks again!

While discussing the issue with a few yocto folks today, it came up that
someone wasn't seeing the same behaviour on the opensuse v5.2 kernel
(but I've yet to figure out exactly where to find that tree) .. but when I do,
I'll try and confirm that and will look for patches or config differences that
could explain the results.

I did confirm that 5.3 shows the same thing today, and I'll do a 5.4-rc1 test
tomorrow.

We are also primarily reproducing the issue on qemux86-64, so I'm also
going to try and rule out qemu (but the same version of qemu with just
the kernel changing shows the issue).

I just wanted to add those data points in case that strace test doesn't
reproduce the problem for you. I'll follow up if I learn anything more during
my debug on Thursday.
