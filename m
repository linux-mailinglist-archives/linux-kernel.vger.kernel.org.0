After (if) these patches are accepted, I can create a patch that adds it 
to sed-opal-temp.

It's actually nothing fancy: It's just a linux program that asks for a 
password and then uses it to unlock all block devices. It's intended to be 
run from an initramfs. So the idea is you build a kernel + initramfs with 
the tool so that the tool it started and after the tool returns, initramfs 
does a reboot. This could be replaced just by a shell script, though then 
you'd have to pass the password from the shell script to e.g. 
sed-opal-temp.

But I think it covers the simple scenario: booting from a locked drive 
with just one locking range. Possibly with other locked drives connected 
that also have one locking range and use the same password (when using pwd 
hash at least the Opal key is not the same).

I got invoved in this just to scratch an itch so I would not be a good 
candidate.

Best regards,
