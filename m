I remember ICL trying to get SVR4.2MP working on similar vintage hardware.
I wasn't directly involved (doing SMP sparc ethernet drivers) but ISTR
that the SMP support silicon they were using (or rather trying to use)
was basically broken.
By the time they got it (nearly) working single cpu systems were faster.

I also remember one of those Compaq dual 486 boxes.
We must have has SVR4/Unixware running on it.

I suspect that any such systems would also be too slow and not have
enough memory to actually run anything recent.

OTOH there are modern 486 (like) systems than might have a reasonable
amount of memory and clock speed.
