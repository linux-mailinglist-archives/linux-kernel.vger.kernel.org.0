Hm right, had to let that spin in my head for a while but I think I got it.

I was only really thinking of:

  (h960: LITTLE = 462 cap, big = 1024)
  p.uclamp.min = 512 -> skip LITTLEs regardless of the actual util_est

but your point is we also want stuff like:

  p.uclamp.max = 300 -> accept LITTLEs regardless of the actual util_est

I'll keep the feec() change as-is and add something like the above in the
changelog for v2.

uclamp_util_with() (or uclamp_rq_util_with() ;)) picks the max between the
rq-aggregated clamps and the task clamps, which isn't what we want. If the
task has a low-ish uclamp.max (e.g. the 300 example from above) but the
rq-wide max-aggregated uclamp.max is ~800, we'd clamp using that 800. It
makes sense for frequency selection, but not for task placement IMO.
