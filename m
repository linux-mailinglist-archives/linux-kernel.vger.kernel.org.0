A grep of the `pwm2` shows that there's such block in rk3399-nanopi4.dtsi:

    &pwm2 {
            pinctrl-names = "active";
            pinctrl-0 = <&pwm2_pin_pull_down>;
            status = "okay";
    };

But last time I checked, using the mainline U-Boot (the roc-rk3399-pc is
in mainline now) with mainline linux v5.2-rc7, no such setting is
necessary, and the board boots happily.

I cannot find the use of "active" pinctrl state in the
`drivers/pwm/pwm-rockchip.c`. If the pinctrl state needs to be setup as
default, the `pinctrl-names` needs to be "default" or "init" (see
`drivers/base/pinctrl.c`) .

Jagan, what version of board do you use? I checked with
"ROC-RK3399-PC-V1.0-A 2018-07-12". 

Thanks
