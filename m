Subject: [PATCH v1] um: drivers: mark non-vector net transports as obsolete

UML_NET_VECTOR now supports filters compiled with pcap outside of UML;
it also supports: EoGRE, EoL2TPv3, RAW (+/- BPF), TAP and BESS.

While vector drivers are not 1:1 replacements for the existing drivers,
you can achieve the same topologies and the same connectivity at much
higher performance (2.5 to 9 Gbit on mid-range Ryzen desktop) - the old
drivers test out in the 500Mbit range on the same hardware.

For all these reasons, the non-vector based transports are now
unnecessary, and some, most notably pcap and vde are maintenance
burdens. Thus, it makes sense to at least start thinking about removing
the non-vector transports, so for now, mark them as obsolete.

I pretty much stole the commit message from Anton's comments in the
above link. Anton, if you would like me to credit you as a co-developer,
feel free to respond with the tags and I will include them on the next
revision.
