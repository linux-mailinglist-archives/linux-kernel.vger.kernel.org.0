I think we should not over-optimize this.  I am all for penalizing
ioperm() and iopl() users as much as is convenient for us.  There is
simply no legitimate use case.  Sorry, DPDK, but "virtio-legacy sucks,
let's optimize the crap out of something that is slow anyway and use
iopl()" is not a good excuse.  Just use the %*!7 syscall to write to
/sys/.../resource0 and suck up the probably negligible performance hit.
And tell your customers to upgrade their hypervisors.  And quite
kvetching about performance of the control place on an old
software-emulated NIC while you're at it.

For the TLB case, it's worth tracking who last used which ASID and
whether it's still up to date, since *everyone* uses the MMU.  For
ioperm, I don't really believe this is worth it.

I agree with the first bit, but caching on an SMP system is necessarily
subtle.  Some kind of invalidation is needed.

Let's please keep the ABI.  Or rather, let's attempt to eventually
remove the ABI, but let's not change it in the mean time please.
