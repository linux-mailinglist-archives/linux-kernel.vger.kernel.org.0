Good, I guess this might be part of why it's got this poor ramp time.

A lot of this discussion is around the definition of terms like "hack"
and "proper".

At least a separate compatible makes sense, I'd have to see the code to
be clear if a completely separate driver makes sense but it'll need
separate ops at least.  There'd definitely be a lot of overlap though so
it's worth looking at.
