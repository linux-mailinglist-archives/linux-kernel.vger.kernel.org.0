I'm well aware of using immutable branches and that those are
often used for patch-set's which touch multiple subsystems. But
although immutable branches are used often they are about as often
not used for various reasons, with people choosing to just merge
through a single tree.

Doing immutable branches assumes that there is a base point,
e.g. 5.5-rc1 where the immutable branch can then be based on and
that the branch can then be merged without issues into both subsystems.

drm is constantly evolving to deal with and mostly catch up with new
hardware as both GPUs and display-pipelines are evolving quite rapidly
atm drm-intel-next has about 400 commits on top of 5.5-rc1 so for an
immutable branch I can either base it on drm-intel-next which
violates your request for a clean minimal branch to merge; or I can
base it on 5.5-rc1 which leads to a big chance of problems when
merging it given to large amount of churn in drm-intel-next.

So instead of the normal case of 2 subsystems seeing some changes
on both side the case we have here is a part of a file which has
not changed since 2015-06-26 in one subsys (and changing only
a single line there!) and OTOH we have bigger changes to a subsys
which see 400 patches land in the first week since rc1 .

I hope that you agree that in this case given the large amount of
churn in drm-intel-next it makes since to just straight forward
apply these patches on top of drm-intel-next.

Regards,

Hans
