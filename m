Right for almost all normal hardware modules but the crypto module was 
designed

for secure world. As a result,Â  the crypto module will become 
inaccessible for linux

kernel if secure world enable it.

We plan to enable the crypto module in secure world so we should set 
crypto module

default disabled in linux kernel.
