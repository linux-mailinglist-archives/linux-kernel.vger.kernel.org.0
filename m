thank you for the explanation
I'll experience this case on newer Amlogic SoCs where regulators are
hidden behind SCPI firmware. so far I have only tested the case
without OPP-table on those SoCs.

OK, I'll be working on this next week again
if you get to fix panfrost earlier then please Cc me so we don't duplicate work
