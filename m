For context, we started parsing /proc/zoneinfo in initscripts to be able 
to determine the order in which vm.lowmem_reserve_ratio needs to be set 
and this required my kernel change from 2017:

commit b2bd8598195f1b2a72130592125ac6b4218988a2
Author: David Rientjes <rientjes@google.com>

    mm, vmstat: print non-populated zones in zoneinfo

Otherwise, we found, it's much more difficult to determine how this array 
should be structured.  So at least we parse this file very carefully, I'm 
not sure how much others do, but it seems like an unnecessary risk for 
little reward.  I'm happy to see it has been decided to drop this patch 
and patch 5.
