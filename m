This device tree property will still be valid when we handle the wait-for-safe
properly for sdm845.
("qcom,smmu-500-fw-impl-safe-errata") property represents just that the
firmware has handles to do the entire sequence -
* read the secure register
* set/reset the bits in the register to enable/disable wait-for-safe for certain
  devices.
And this is valid when firmware masks access to this register from any other
EE.
So we don't have to do anything that, for example, we were doing for sdm845
based cheza's firmware [1] that implements simple scm handlers to read/write
secure registers.

And fyi, some of the newer SoCs too have this logic, and kernel can have that
extra bit of page-table-ops to handle wait-safe toggling.

Looking at this branch quickly, it seem there can be separate implementation
level configuration file that can be added.
But will this also handle separate page table ops when required in future.
