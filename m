Very interesting topic. I heard similar demand from HPC folks 
(especially involving other memory types ("tiers")). There, I think you 
often want to let the application manage that. But of course, for many 
applications an automatic management might already be beneficial.

Am I correct that you are using PMEM in this area along with ZONE_DEVICE 
and not by giving PMEM to the buddy (add_memory())?
