It does not. We do not want and need to tie secure launch with UEFI.

Yeah, most but not all...

Currently it is a bootloader, the GRUB which I am working on... OK, this
is not perfect but if we want to call ExitBootServices() from the kernel
then we have to move all pre-launch code from the bootloader to the
kernel. Not nice because then everybody who wants to implement secure
launch in different kernel, hypervisor, etc. has to re-implement whole
pre-launch code again.

Yes, it does.

I think any post-launch code in the kernel should not call anything from
the gap. And UEFI belongs to the gap. OK, we can potentially re-use UEFI
TPM code in the pre-launch phase but I am not convinced that we should
(I am looking at it right now). And this leads us to other question
which pops up here and there. How to call UEFI runtime services, e.g. to
modify UEFI variables, update firmware, etc., from MLE or even from the
OS started from MLE? In my opinion it is not safe to call anything from
the gap after secure launch. However, on the other hand we have to give
an option to change the boot order or update the firmware. So, how to
do that? I do not have an easy answer yet...

Daniel
