Right, I don't have any stake in that out-of-tree caching either. I am
more just interested in trying to get Linux to generically reach as many
NVMe spec features as possible, and extended formats have been in-spec
since the beginning of nvme.

And yes, that bouncing is really nasty, but it's really only needed for
PRP, so maybe let's just not ignore that transfer mode and support
extended metadata iff the controller supports SGLs. We just need a
special SGL setup routine to weave the data and metadata.
