... to STFU, 'cause you know better.  The trouble is, how do we
(or yourself a year or two later) know *why* it is correct?
Worse, how do we (or yourself, etc.) know if a change about to be
done to the code won't invalidate the proof of yours?

What's confusing is mixing host- and fixed-endian values in the
same variable at different times.  Treat those as unrelated
types that happen to have the same sizeof.

Quite a few of __force instances in the tree should be taken out
and shot.  Don't add to their number.
