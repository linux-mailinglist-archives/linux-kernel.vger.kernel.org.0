yes, I can lock a smaller portion.
And at the power-on of device with PT pin at high voltage, all blocks are 
locked.
They have to be unlocked by set feature command.

okay, patch specific manufacturer _lock/_unlock driver
in nand_manufacturer_init();

and in the final of nand_scan_tail()
if (!mtd->_lock)
        mtd->_lock = NULL;
if (!mtd->_unlock)
        mtd->_unlock = NULL;

thanks for your time and comments.
