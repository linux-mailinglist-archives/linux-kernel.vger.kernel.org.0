This makes life difficult for scripts that manipulate the control
file, since they now need to check two different locations -- either
/sys/kernel/debug or /proc.  It's likely that people who normally use
distribution kernels where debugfs is disabled will have scripts which
are hard-coded to look in /proc, and then when they build a kernel
with debugfs enabled, the /proc entry will go **poof**, and their
script will break.

So regardless of what we do with the control file in debugfs, it might
be nice if moving forward, scripts can count on the /proc file
existing.
