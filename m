Not actively on the way out yet, but now that we support all
architectures it becomes pretty clear we don't need it.  So yes, we
could eventually remove it.  But..

This is where it becomes interesting.  Because while we don't need the
dev argument for the low-level arch API, we do need it at the driver
API level, given that in some systems both dma coherent and non-coherent
devices exist, and we need to decide based on that.

Well, we'll still need a defined API for buffer ownership vs device.
Just exporting arch_sync_dma_for_{device,cpu} is not the right
abstraction level.  Note that these two functions are always present,
just stubbed out for architectures that do not support non-cache
coherent devices (plus the arm false negative that is easily fixable).
