I have the short-term memory of a squirrel, remember I get 1000 emails a
day to deal with.

That thread was from back in May, the instructions on what was needed to
be done is quite simple, so there should not have been a multi-month
delay from then until now.  What happened?

Don't be sorry, you have fixed it up to make it ready to be merged
properly.  But yes, there is no progress being made now, so it should
either be dropped or merged properly.

If you don't have the time now to do it, that's fine, the revert to get
the code back just takes one single git command when you, or someone
else, can get the chance to do it.

Don't take it personally, this is about to happen to almost all of the
staging drivers that have been languishing around :)

thanks,
