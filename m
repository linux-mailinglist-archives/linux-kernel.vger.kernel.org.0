It is a bit hard to make sense of this dump, specially on such a wide
machine (I want one!) without really knowing the topology of the 
system.

One of the difference is that with this patch, the initial affinity
is picked inside the NUMA node that matches the ITS. In your case,
that's either node 0 or 2. But it is unclear whether which CPUs these
map to.

Given that I see interrupts mapped to CPUs 0-23 on one side, and 48-71
on the other, it looks like half of your machine gets starved, and that
may be because no ITS targets the NUMA nodes they are part of. It would
be interesting to see what happens if you manually set the affinity
of the interrupts outside of the NUMA node.

Thanks,

         M.
