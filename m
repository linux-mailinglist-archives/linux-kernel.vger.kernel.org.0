The patch has been committed into printk.git, branch for-5.3-fixes.

I am still a bit undecided whether to send pull request the following
week or wait for 5.4. On one hand, it is very old bug (since 3.5).
On the other hand, I think that it was not reported/fixed earlier
only because it was hard to notice. And loosing the very last message
is quite pity.

Anyway, I added stable tag.

Best Regards,
Petr
