Ok, so basically open-coding the aligned access to RIRBSTS?
That sounds like a much nicer workaround. So in place of

                        sd_status = snd_hdac_stream_readb(s, SD_STS);
                        dev_vdbg(bus->dev, "stream %d status 0x%x\n",
                                 s->index, sd_status);
                        snd_hdac_stream_writeb(s, SD_STS, sd_status);

I suppose one could just readl/writel SOF_HDA_ADSP_REG_CL_SD_CTL
and print the shifted value, right?

While I know nothing about the underlying requirements, I wonder
about two things that stick out to me:

1. the existing code just writes back the same byte it has read. If
    this write has no side-effects, why write it at all? OTOH, if it has
    side-effects, isn't the aligned implementation of writing the whole
    word in snd_hdac_aligned_write()  fundamentally flawed?

2. Doesn't the read-modify-write cycle in snd_hdac_aligned_write()
   need locking to work correctly?
