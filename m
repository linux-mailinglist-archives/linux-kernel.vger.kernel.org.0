Those gotoes do seems convoluted, I do agree.

TBH I'm not a fun of this hack. This would bring in other confusion or 
complexity. Pagevec is supposed to count in the number of base page, now 
it would treat THP as one page, and there might be mixed base page and 
THP in one pagevec. But, I tend to agree avoiding getting those 14 extra 
pins at the first place might be a better approach. All the complexity 
are used to release those extra pins.
