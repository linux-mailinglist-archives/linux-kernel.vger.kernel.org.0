Speakup is used by things like the Debian Installer in speech mode.
I'd assume D-I uses udev.

However Speakup is also likely to be used by blind people who prefer
older environments--no GUI, no pulseaudio, that sort of thing.
No udev is kind of pushing that mindset to the extreme though.
Speakup is not typically used without a keyboard or similar, so you're
not going to see it on embedded systems.

I might ask on debian-accessibility@lists.debian.org.
My recollection is that the upstream is not very energetic, and that the
distros keep speakup working because it's quite important for some
people.
We broke it on hda_intel for the original Buster release and that
certainly generated lots of user feedback.

debian-accessibility is Debian specific.  There is the more general
blinux-l@lists.redhat.com (blind linux users), but that lists tends to
be so user focused that you might not get good feedback to a question
like this.
