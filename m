A minor nit, but since you're making a table out of this, you don't need
the colons in the first column.

As a general rule, we would rather see less markup in the text files than
you are applying here.  Just present the prototypes in a literal block
here.  (Even better would be a nice kerneldoc comment in the source that
could be pulled in, but that's more work).  I wouldn't use :code: anywhere,
really. 

As well as addressing Mathieu's comments, could you pass through and cut
the markup down to the bare minimum?

Thanks,

jon
