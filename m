Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] Support XSAVES supervisor states

Changes from v1 to v2:

- Split out small changes to:
    https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20191212210855.19260-1-yu-cheng.yu@intel.com/

- Fix an issue in patch #4, where fpu__clear_user_states() drops
  supervisor xstates.

- Add three patches:
    Patch #6: Update sanitize_restored_xstate() for supervisor xstates.
    Patch #7: Update copy_kernel_to_xregs_err() to use XRSTORS when
              supervisor xstates are present.
    Patch #8: Update __fpu__restore_sig() to preserve supervisor xstates.

Also make some small changes in response to comments.  More details are in
each patch's commit log.

There are two types of XSAVE-managed states (xstates): user and supervisor.
This series introduces the supervisor xstate support in preparation for new
features that will make use of supervisor xstates.

This series has been separated for ease of review from the series that add
supervisor xstate features [3].

In current and near future generations of Intel processors there are three
classes of objects that can be managed as supervisor xstates:

- Processor Trace (PT):
    Linux already supports PT, but PT xstates are not saved to the FPU
    context and not context-switched by the kernel.  There are no plans to
    integrate PT into XSAVES supervisor states.

- ENQCMD Process Address Space ID (MSR_IA32_PASID):
    ENQCMD is a new instruction and will be introduced shortly in a
    separate series [2].

- Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET):
    CET is being reviewed on the LKML [1] [3].

Supervisor xstates can be accessed only from the kernel (PL-0) with XSAVES/
XRSTORS instructions.  They cannot be accessed with other XSAVE*/XRSTOR*
instructions.  MSR_IA32_XSS sets enabled supervisor xstates, while XCR0
sets enabled user xstates.

This series separates the two xstate types by declaring new macros for each
type.  The kernel finds all available features during system initialization
and stores them in xfeatures_mask_all.  It then retrieves perspective
xstate type with xfeatures_mask_supervisor()/xfeatures_mask_user() for
handling signals and PTRACE.
