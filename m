Hi Xunlei,

Right, setting "max" is generally a fine way of going about it.

That's not correct -- leaf memcgs have to _explicitly_ request memory 
protection. From the documentation:

    memory.low

    [...]

    Best-effort memory protection.  If the memory usages of a
    cgroup and all its ancestors are below their low boundaries,
    the cgroup's memory won't be reclaimed unless memory can be
    reclaimed from unprotected cgroups.

Note the part that the cgroup itself also must be within its low boundary, 
which is not implied simply by having ancestors that would permit propagation 
of protections.

In this case, Docker just shouldn't request it for those Docker-related tasks, 
and they won't get any. That seems a lot simpler and more intuitive than 
special casing "0" in ancestors.

Not so, this change is extremely "special". It violates the basic expectation 
that 0 means no possibility of propagation of protection, and I still don't see 
a compelling argument why Docker can't just set "max" in the intermediate 
cgroup and not accept any protection in leaf memcgs that it doesn't want 
protection for.
