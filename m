The medlow code model on RISC-V essentially enforces this -- technically it
enforces a 32-bit region centered around address 0, but it's not that hard to
stay away from negative addresses.  That said, as long as elf2flt gives you an
error it should be fine because all medlow is going to do is give you a
different looking error message.
