	Re original patch: looks like the sane way to handle that.
Alternatively, we could add kvfree_atomic() for use in such situations,
but I rather doubt that it's a good idea - not unless you need to free
something under a spinlock held over a large area, which is generally
a bad idea to start with...

	Note that vfree_atomic() has only one caller in the entire tree,
BTW.
