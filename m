don't know ;-)

but I'd like to have one way of finding out the directory layout

the code for threaded record uses DIR_FORMAT feature value
to ensure the directory contains the expected files, which
is data file with 'data.<cpu>' name for every cpu

ok, that might work, but please make that somehow explicit/visible
what files/directories are possible in the directory, so we could
easily see them and add new ones
