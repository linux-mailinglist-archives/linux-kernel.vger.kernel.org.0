I looked at QGP{0,1}, but did not see it represented in the current
Device Tree implementation and thus failed to identify it.  Do you
know what it is?  Does it have a driver in Linux already?

That is not allowed when booting ACPI.  The Clock/Regulator frameworks
are not to be used in this use-case, hence why all of the calls to
these frameworks are "stubbed out".  If we wanted to properly
implement power management, we would have to create a driver/subsystem
similar to the "Windows-compatible System Power Management Controller"
(PEP).  Without documentation for the PEP, this would be an impossible
task.  A request for the aforementioned documentation has been put in
to Lenovo/Qualcomm.  Hopefully something appears soon.

Judging by the code alone, the wrapper doesn't sound like it does much
at all.  It seems to only have a single (version) register (at least
that is the only register that's used).  The only registers it
reads/writes are those of the calling device, whether that be I2C, SPI
or UART.

Device Tree represents the wrapper's relationship with the I2C (and
SPI/UART) Serial Engine (SE) devices as parent-child ones, with the
wrapper being the parent and SE the child.  Whether this is a true
representation of the hardware or just a tactic used for convenience
is not clear, but the same representation does not exist in ACPI.

In the current Linux implementation, the buffer belongs to the SE
(obtained by the child (e.g. I2C) SE by fetching the parent's
(wrapper's) device data using the standard platform helpers) but the
register-set used to control the DMA transactions belong to the SE
devices.

Yes, the SMMU devices are represented in ACPI (MMU0) and (MMU1).  They
share the same register addresses as the SMMU devices located in
arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sdm845.dtsi.

With this simple parameter checking patch, the SE falls back to using
FIFO mode to transmit data and continues to work flawlessly.  IMHO
this should be applied in the first instance, as it fixes a real (null
dereference) bug which currently resides in the Mainline kernel.

Moving forward we can try to come up with a suitable plan to implement
DMA in the ACPI use-case - but again, this is feature adding work
which should be carried out against -next, where as this patch needs
to go in via the current -rcs ASAP.
