After quick check I've found a bug (maybe?). It's not possible to specify
vcc-pl-supply, because of this:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/pinctrl/sunxi/pinctrl-sunxi.c#L778

During the probe of the pmu, the pinctrl tries to get a regulator, that 
doesn't exist yet.
Because of this the system doesn't start (as expected).

I've tried to ignore -EPROBE_DEFER. This seems to work, but only because 
the regulator for
PL is defined as "regulator-always-on". The problem is that the refcount 
is not incremented.
So if you export one gpio and the unexport it, the regulator will be 
disabled. I'm not sure
how this can be resolved.

Should I skip vcc-pl-supply for now and list the other bank supplies?
