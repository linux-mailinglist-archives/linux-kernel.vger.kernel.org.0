Yes, we have a few users, not many, e.g. https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk

I believe we may have more users as we are submitting code to make this
driver more usable.

Let me think about this, if we want to do this clean up, we have to 
increase the API version to tell everybody, things are changed. If
finally we decide to do this clean up, that will be a new patch after
this patchset.

Many Thanks for your patient guide and suggestions. :)
