Hi Marc,

Initial results look good. We have 3x NVMe drives now, as opposed to 2x 
previously, which is better for this test.

Before: ~1.3M IOPs fio read
After: ~1.8M IOPs fio read

So a ~50% gain in throughput.

We also did try NVMe with nvme.use_threaded_interrupts=1. As you may 
remember, the NVMe interrupt handling can cause lockups, as they handle 
all completions in interrupt context by default.

Before: ~1.2M IOPs fio read
After: ~1.2M IOPs fio read

So they were about the same. I would have hoped for an improvement here, 
considering before we would have all the per-queue threaded handlers 
running on the single CPU handling the hard irq.

But we will retest all this tomorrow, so please consider these 
provisional for now.

Thanks to Luo Jiaxing for testing.

Cheers,
john
