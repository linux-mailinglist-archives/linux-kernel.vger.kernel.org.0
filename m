Yes. Legacy virtio seems to have been designed without consideration
of how to use it in userspace. Xen, Vmware and Hyper-V all use memory
as a doorbell mechanism which is easier to use from userspace.

The cost of entering the kernel for a doorbell mechanism is too
expensive and would kill performance.

There is no way to use memory doorbell on older versions of virtio.
Users want to run DPDK on old stuff like RHEL6 and even older
kernel forks. There are even use cases where virtio is used for
a non-Linux host; such as GCP.


> 3. Use ioperm() instead of iopl().

Ioperm has the wrong thread semantics. All DPDK applications have
multiple threads and the initialization logic needs to work even
if the thread is started later; threads can also be started by
the user application.

Iopl applies to whole process so this is not an issue.

Please fix virtio.
