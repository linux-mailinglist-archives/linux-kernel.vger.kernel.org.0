I thought it was decided to panic here, because we don't assign a house
keeping CPU so the system is unlikely to behave properly. A warn might
scroll off the screen by the time things grind to a halt.

This is a one-time boot parameter misconfiguration, many cases of which
can cause a panic and boot stop.

No question if we can make this more dynamic that would be better, but
for near term at least can we go with this?
