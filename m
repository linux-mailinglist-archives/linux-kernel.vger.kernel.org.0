Yes - and I may yet implement a "soft PDC" device if this turns out to
be more than a 'quirk' for a very small number of device. But like you
say - it doesn't need to be (and shouldn't be) in the actual device tree.

For now though I think the code Nicolas has written works well enough
and it's only really worth 'fixing' if we end up with too many 'quirky'
devices.
