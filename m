Subject: [PATCH 0/8] docs: Fixes for recent versions of Sphinx

The Sphinx folks deprecated some interfaces in the 2.0 release; one
immediate result of that is a bunch of warnings that show up when building
with 1.8.  These two patches make those warnings go away, but at a cost:

 - It introduces a couple of Sphinx version checks, which are always
   ugly, but the alternative would be to stop supporting versions
   before 1.7.  For now, I think we can carry that cruft.

 - The second patch causes the build to fail horribly on newer
   Sphinx installations.  The change to switch_source_input() seems
   to make the parser much more finicky, increasing warnings and
   eventually failing the build altogether.  In particular, it will
   scream about problems in .rst files that are not included in the
   TOC tree at all.

This version of the patch set fixes up the worst problems (the i915 error
in particular, which breaks the build hard).  I've tested it with versions
1.4, 1.8, and 2.0.

Given that these problems are already breaking builds on some systems, I
think I may try to sell these changes to Linus for 5.2 still.

Changes since v1:
  - Fix up a couple of logging changes I somehow missed
  - Don't save state when using switch_source_input()
  - Fix a few build errors
  - Add Mauro's sphinx-pre-install improvements
