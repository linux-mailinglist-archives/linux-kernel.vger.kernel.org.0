Right, but again like below - that's just mapped, not actually used. But
as far as I can tell, once you actually start running and potentially
use all of your mem=1024 (MB), you'll actually also use another 128MB on
the KASAN shadow, right?

Unlike, say, a real x86_64 machine where if you just have 1024 MB
physical memory, the KASAN shadow will have to fit into that as well.

Right, ok, thanks for the explanation. I guess then stack
instrumentation should be disabled for this patch initially.

Well I had two patches:
 (1) the module constructors one - I guess we need to test it, but you
     can include it here if you like. I'm kinda swamped with other
     things right now, no promises I can actually test it soon, though I
     really do want to because that's the case I need :)
 (2) the [DEMO] patch - you should just take the few lines you need from
     that (in the linker script) and stick it into this patch. Don't
     even credit me for that, I only wrote it as a patch instead of a
     normal text email reply because I couldn't figure out how to word
     things in an understandable way...

Then we end up with 2 patches again, the (1) and your KASAN one. There's
no point in keeping the [DEMO] separate, and

You can always "exit(17)" or something.

I'm not sure you can continue without KASAN?

Arguably it's better to fail loudly anyway if something as simple as the
mmap() here fails - after all, that probably means the KASAN offset in
Kconfig needs to be adjusted?
