I understand and agree with the argument that if reclaimable pages are
less than high wmark then no need to reclaim. Regarding not depending
on general reclaimability, I thought you meant that even if
reclaimable pages are over high wmark, we might not want to continue
the reclaim to not cause thrashing. Is that right?

The perf profile shows that the kswapd is spending almost all its time
in list_lru_count_one and memcg tree traversal. So, it's not just one
shrinker.

Yes, it's not exactly the same problem but I would say it is similar.
For Sultan's issue, even if there are many reclaimable pages, we don't
want to thrash. In this issue, thrashing is not happening but kswapd
is going nuts on slab shrinkers.
