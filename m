Right, that occurred to me as well. The actual requirement isn't quite
as restrictive. What you really need is the old vector to be
registered on both the old CPU and the new CPU. Then once the
interrupt is confirmed to have moved we could release both the old
vector both CPUs, leaving only the new vector on the new CPU.

In that world some SMP affinity transitions might fail, which is a
bummer. To avoid that, you could first migrate to a vector that's
available on both the source and destination CPUs, keeping affinity
the same. Then change affinity in a separate step.

Or alternatively, you could permanently designate a "transit" vector.
If an interrupt fires on this vector, then we call all ISRs currently
in transit between CPUs. You might end up calling ISRs that didn't
actually need service, but at least that's better than missing edges.

Here it is:
https://pastebin.com/YyxBUvQ2

This is a Comet Lake system. It has 8 HT cores, but 4 of those cores
have already been offlined.

At the bottom of the paste I also included the script I used that
causes a repro in a minute or two. I simply run this, then put some
stress on USB. For me that stress was "join a Hangouts meeting", since
that stressed both my USB webcam and USB ethernet. The script exits
when xhci dies.
