You don't need to change anything in this driver, your clock provider will only
set the values it supports. So in malidp_crtc_atomic_enable() we set the
desired pxlclk, but your provider will drop/refuse the change, so in
malidp_crtc_mode_valid() only the 4 supported resolutions will pass, all other
modes will fail.

I don't, I still don't have a LS1028A platform ;)
