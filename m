Assuming you're referring to the separate EEXTEND ioctl()...

Everyone:

Is a dedicated EEXTEND ioctl() needed now, i.e. is there an existing or
in-flight use case that would break by having only the MEASURE flag in
ADD_PAGE?

If the answer is 'no' from all parties, my preference would be to hold off
on adding it until there is an actual end user.  To be clear, I'm not
against adding such an ioctl(), I just don't want to add code where the
only user is a kernel selftest.
