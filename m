In general this is very rare event.

This exact pattern have been seen ten times or so on several servers with
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2660 v4 @ 2.00GHz
(this custom built platform with chipset Intel C610)

and haven't seen for previous generation
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v2 @ 2.60GHz
(this is another custom built platform)

So, this might be not related to cpu model.

ACPI power management timer is a pretty standard x86 hardware.
But my patch should work for any platform with any second reliable clocksource.

If there is no second clocksource my patch does noting:
watchdog_backup stays NULL and backup_consent always true.
