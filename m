Sure, I will set invalid_vector of every unused part of the table.

The userland provides several segments that need to be loaded at
specific physical locations. Each of those segment is mapped with
virtually contiguous source and destinations. We do not have swiss
cheese, even between the segments the VAs are contiguous.

Kexec loads segments in the common code, and pages for the segments
are allocated one at a time in a special allocator that checks that
the allocated pages are outside of the destination addresses. The
allocations are done one base page at a time:

kimage_load_normal_segment()
  kimage_alloc_page()

Unlike with control pages, it is not simple to change them to use
large pages. The control pages can be allocated as large pages, as
kimage_alloc_normal_control_pages() accepts an "order" argument.

Without overhaul of the common code I do not see how can we benefit
from having large pages here. But even then, imo it is not a high
priority. Performance wise, I do not think we will win anything by
using large mappings here. The only benefit of using large pages here
is to save space. But, we do not waste any space for crash kernel, as
crash kernel does not require relocation, so the only space that we
will space is only for normal reboot, but that means we are about to
be rebooted, and saving space is probably not a high priority.

I had some RFC version of this project where I had a linear map, but
was asked to create mapping only for segments that are being copied.
Which, I think is the right approach here.  The page table is smaller
(when small mappings are used), faster, because copies are not
sparse), and the assembly code is MUCH simpler because all we need to
do if bcopy(src, dst, len)

+3:     copy_page x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10
+       sub     x11, x11, #PAGE_SIZE
+       cbnz    x11, 3b                         /* page copy loop */

These 3 lines copy all segments to the correct locations.

To be honest, I am a little lost here. Do you mean machine has
physical addresses above ttbr0 VA-range? If so, seems we need  to
reserve few idmapped pages for trans_pgd... But, what to do if all
physical memory is outside of ttbr0 VA-range? Means, we can't use
idmap at all?
Also, reserving is not good because what if user requested kexec
segments to be loaded into idmaped reserved memory..

I checked, arm64_relocate_new_kernel_size is not known at compile
time, so unfortunately BUILD_BUG_ON() cannot be used here. However, if
you think this check is ugly, I can put them into separate pages, and
map these pages independently (or do this conditionally when the above
condition fails, which should never happen, as I cannot imagine
arm64_relocate_new_kernel_size to ever grow that big).

Thank you,
Pasha
