Also, I can go back to 500M if I just keep KFREE_DRAIN_JIFFIES at HZ/50. So I
am quite happy about that. I think I can declare that the "let list grow
indefinitely" design works quite well even with an insanely heavily loaded
case of every CPU in a 16CPU system with 500M memory, indefinitely doing
kfree_rcu()in a tight loop with appropriate cond_resched(). And I am like
thinking - wow how does this stuff even work at such insane scales :-D

kthread_prio=50 definitely reduced the probability of OOM but it still
occurred.

I meant for high kfree_rcu() loads, a softirq context executing RCU callback
is still better from the point of view of the callback running because the
softirq will run above all else (higher than the highest priority task) so
use_softirq=0 would be a down grade from that perspective if something higher
than rcutree.kthread_prio is running on the CPU. So unless kthread_prio is
set to the highest prio, then softirq running would work better. Did I miss
something?

I did not try this yet. But I am thinking why would this help in nohz_idle
case? In nohz_idle we already have the tick active when CPU is idle. I guess
it is because there may be a long time that elapses before
rcu_data.rcu_need_heavy_qs == true ?
