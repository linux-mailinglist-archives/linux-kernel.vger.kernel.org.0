The issue I see is suppose we have a range of latency-nice values, then it
should cover the entire range of search (one core to all cores). As Peter
said some workloads will want to search the LLC fully. If we have absolute
time, the map of latency-nice values range to them will be arbitrary. If
you have something in mind let me know, may be I am thinking differently.

I guess I got the definition of "latency tolerant" backwards.

If a workload has set it to low latency tolerant, then the search will be
less. That can lead to localization of threads on a few CPUs as we are not
searching the entire LLC even if there are idle CPUs available. For this
I had introduced a per-CPU variable (for the target CPU) to track the
boundary of search so that every time it will start from the boundary, thus
sliding the window. So even if we are searching very little the search
window keeps shifting and gives us a good spread. This is orthogonal to the
latency-nice thing.

Doing it for select_idle_core will have the issue that the dynamic flag
(whether an idle core is present or not) can only be updated by threads
which are doing the full search.
