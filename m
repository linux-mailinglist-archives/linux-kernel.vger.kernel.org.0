What?  Why do you need a structure?  A pointer to the name and the ops
should be all that is needed, right?

And 'dev' here is a pointer to the parent, right?  Might want to make
that explicit in the name of the variable :)

You should NEVER be matching on a parent.  If so, your use of the driver
model is wrong :)

Remind me to really review the use of the driver core code in your next
submission of this series please, I think it needs it.
