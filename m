I could try the approach you're suggesting but I didn't actually see an issue
with the patch in its current state other than the WARN_ON_ONCE which I could
change to WARN_ON_ONCE(in_irq()) to remove the concern. AFAICS, we don't
detect "half soft-interrupts" in this code in anyway.

I do feel the approach you're suggesting can be a follow up, these 2 patches
just focus on deleting dynticks_nmi_nesting counter and we can test this
approach thoroughly for a release or so.

IMHO, most of the changes are to code comments, the actual code change is
very little and is just removal of dynticks_nmi_nesting and simplification;
its not really an introduction of a new mechanism.
