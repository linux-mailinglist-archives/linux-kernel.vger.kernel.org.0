I had gotten fried by this point and had not queued this patch in advance
so I don't want to comment one way or the other. However, I note this was
not picked up in tip and it probably is best that this series all go in
as one lump and not separate out the fixes in the final merge. Otherwise
it'll trigger false positives by LKP.
