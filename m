Thank you for your comments. As for compiler and what can be generated
as a result depends on arch, etc, so i agree here. "inline" is a hint only.
But it can be rewritten. One way is to use __always_inline another one is:

<snip>
RBTYPE max = max3(RBCOMPUTE(node),				    \
	node->RBFIELD.rb_left ?					    \
		rb_entry(node->RBFIELD.rb_left,			    \
			RBSTRUCT, RBFIELD)->RBAUGMENTED:0,	    \
	node->RBFIELD.rb_right ?				    \
		rb_entry(node->RBFIELD.rb_right,		    \
			RBSTRUCT, RBFIELD)->RBAUGMENTED:0);
<snip>

i.e. directly embed an access to the left/right nodes into max3().
That way we can get rid of extra "child" variable and to have a liner
code as "before" variant.

Again, i am not interested in just pushing this change, the aim was
to make it more readable for others and that is it.

I see your point. Indeed the generated code is bit bigger with the change,
however with above modification it improves the situation and becomes:
<snip>
284544 Aug 13 09:53 interval_tree.o
283192 Aug 13 09:57 interval_tree.o.orig
<snip>

but is still a bit higher. If we care about that, then i will drop this patch,
because "before" code is better in that context.

If we care about negative augmented values, then we should stick to
"before" code. Agree here. If you have any ideas how to extend and
cover negative cases, please let me know. Otherwise we can drop this
change and do not pay much attention at it.

Thank you.
