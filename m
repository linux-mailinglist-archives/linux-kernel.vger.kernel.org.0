Oh, that makes sense.  I thought it should be updated after all the data
was written, but it probably doesn't make much difference.

The problem for shmem is this:

                        spin_unlock(&inode->i_lock);
                        schedule();

                        spin_lock(&inode->i_lock);
                        finish_wait(shmem_falloc_waitq, &shmem_fault_wait);
                        spin_unlock(&inode->i_lock);

While scheduled, the VMA can go away and the inode be reclaimed, making
this a use-after-free.  The initial suggestion was an increment on
the inode refcount, but since we already have a pattern which involves
pinning the file, I thought that was a better way to go.
