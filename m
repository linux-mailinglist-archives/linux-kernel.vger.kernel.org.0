Haven't we been here before? ;)

Since we can't (safely or reasonably) change a group's default domain 
after ops->add_device() has returned, and in general it gets impractical 
to evaluate "all device in a group" once you look beyond &pci_bus_type 
(or consider hotplug as mentioned), then AFAICS there's no reasonable 
way to get away from the default domain type being defined by the first 
device to attach. But in practice it's hardly a problem anyway - if 
every device in a given group requests the same domain type then it 
doesn't matter which comes first, and if they don't then we ultimately 
end up with an impossible set of constraints, so are doomed to do the 
'wrong' thing regardless.

Thus unless anyone wants to start redefining the whole group concept to 
separate the notions of ID aliasing and peer-to-peer isolation (which 
still wouldn't necessarily help), I think this user override effectively 
boils down to just another flavour of iommu_request_*_for_dev(), and as 
such comes right back to the "just pass the bloody device to 
ops->domain_alloc() and resolve everything up-front" argument.

Robin.
