You should have been more specific then, if you wanted to see someone
special.

Who can give a better comments regarding the clk API if not the
subsystem maintainers?

Hm, you are right. I didn't fully thought this through. The thing is
that according to the clk_rate_exclusive_get() function code currently
it never fails. Though this isn't excuse for introducing a prone to future
bugs code.

Anyway if according to design a function may return an error we must take
into account in the code using it. Due to this obligation and seeing we can't
easily detect whether clk_rate_exclusive_get() has been failed while the
driver is being executed in the shutdown method, the best approach would be
to just return an error in startup method in case of the clock rate exclusivity
acquisition failure. If you are ok with this, I'll have it fixed in v3
patchset.

Here is what I had in my mind while implementing this code. If d->clk
isn't NULL, then there is a "baudclk" clock handler and we can use it to
alter/retrieve the baud clock rate. But the same clock could be used by
some other driver and that driver could have changed the rate while we
didn't have this tty port started up (opened). In this case that driver
could also have the clock exclusively acquired. So instead of trying to
set the current p->uartclk rate to the clock, check the return value,
if it's an error, try to get the current clock rate, check the return
value, and so on, I just get the current baud clock rate and make sure
the value is not zero (clk_get_rate() returns a zero rate in case of
internal errors). At the same time dw8250_set_termios() will try to update
the baud clock rate anyway (also by the serial core at the point of the port
startup), so we don't need such complication in the DW 8250 port startup
code.

> (and note, that we still update uartclk member!),

Yes, if we can't determine the current baud clock rate, then the there is
a problem with the clock device, so we don't know at what rate it's
currently working. Zero is the most appropriate value to be set in this case.

> we try to put (why?) the > exclusiveness of rate.

Yes, we put the exclusivity and return an error, because this if-branch has
been taken only if the exclusivity has been successfully acquired.
