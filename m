Mark, this comes my NHLT fixes merged by Takashi and available on his 
topic/hda-dmic branch.

This can be fixed by merging this topic/hda-dmic into your for-next 
branch, with a minor set of merge conflicts already identified by Stephen.

If you don't like merge conflicts, we can also do this with 
revert-merge-reapply, I pushed a branch 
https://github.com/plbossart/sound/commits/fix/nhlt-conflicts to provide 
the sequence needed

Sorry about that, let me know if I can help further.
