Correct.

With both patches reverted the driver falls back to polled mode, with
just the flag commit reverted the screaming interrupt issue is still
present.

The regression was detected when moving to v5.3.6 which includes
commit 7f064c378e2c "tpm_tis_core: Turn on the TPM before probing
IRQ's".

I've never seen interrupts working.

I'll try to get a result from a pre-5.3.4 kernel to see what the
behavior is. I did have system owner run an experiment with
tpm_tis.interrupts=0 on the kernel command line and that also avoids
the problem.
