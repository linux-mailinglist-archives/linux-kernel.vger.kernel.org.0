Thanks, will try v3 once it will be ready.

I took a look through the T20 board's schematics and seems it doesn't
use the Blink clock for the WiFi, instead it uses 32k source directly
from PMU. While T30 board schematics tells that  32k comes out from the
Tegra chip.

BTW, I'm curious what's the reason for having Blink clock always-ON on
T20/30, any insights? Looks like it's just some relic from old clk
driver and it should be safe to drop the always-ON.
