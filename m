A few overall comments:

* CPU_PM certainly seems interesting and I wasn't aware of it.

* Your series is predicated on nobody calling any of the RPMH
functions after the last CPU enters low power mode with CPU_PM_ENTER
and before some CPU calls CPU_PM_EXIT.  Is it worth adding a check for
that to the code?  This is super important for the 'zero-active-TCS'
case but even for the 'some-active-TCS' it's still important that
nobody tries to update the sleep/wake values after you flush.

* I think your series is focused on idle, right?  What about
suspend/resume?  You need a flush before suspend, right?  Do you need
to register for something to handle suspend, or do the pm callbacks
all get called for full system suspend?  If so, how late do they get
called?

Name "cpus_entered_pm" to match Linux naming?  Also the comment should
clearly say that this is only used in non-solver mode.

Comment should say that this is only for non-solver mode.

This is almost, but not quite in kernel-doc syntax.  Why not make it
match the example in "Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst"?
Specifically trying to follow that style:

 * rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_busy() - Check if any of the AMCs are busy.
 * @drv: The controller
 *
 * Return: true if TCSes are engaged in handling requests; else false

As per my documentation patch, tcs_is_free():

 * Must be called with the drv->lock held or the tcs_lock for the TCS being
 * tested.

...I think you're OK calling without the lock since you're running on
the last CPU (and you're blocking any other CPUs from coming online)
and interrupts are disabled, but please document.

nit: you can get away with just spin_lock().  cpu_pm_enter() is
documented to be called with interrupts already disabled so the
"irqsave" and "irqrestore" is useless.

Is it ever possible to offline a CPU after doing "CPU_PM_ENTER" on it?
 If so you'll never be "equal" to the online mask again.  This seems
safer:

!cpumask_subset(cpu_online_mask, &drv->cpus_in_pc)

Are you sure you can't just skip the call to rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_busy()?
 Specifically, I'm not sure why you need to block until the last
active mode transaction is done.

a) If the active mode transaction was on its own TCS, I'd hope that
the RPMH hardware would know to let the active transitions happen
before triggering the sleep (please confirm)

b) If the active mode transaction was borrowing the wake TCS the flush
should notice and return NOTIFY_BAD anyway.

Oh!  ...but looking closer at case b) points out a problem anyway.
You need to go into rpmh_flush() and stop having it loop on 'while
(ret == -EAGAIN)".  As per my documentation series (please review)
when -EAGAIN is returned it's important that the caller enable
interrupts for a little while before trying again.  You're not doing
that here.  Maybe if you fix it then you can get rid of your special
case rpmh_rsc_ctrlr_is_busy()?


> +       ret = rpmh_flush(&drv->client);

Back when RPMH first landed we had a whole argument about whether it
should be one file or two.  Given that it's currently two files, I
think the abstraction is that rpmh-rsc generally doesn't call into
rpmh except for the very special rpmh_tx_done().

...so seems like the whole pm_callback should move into rpmh.c and not
in rpmh-rsc.c?

I don't understand this part of the change.  Why move "base" into the
driver data.  It's not needed after probe.  Please undo this.  If you
really feel like base needs to be separate please move to its own
patch.

nit: init the spin lock before registering instead of after.

Now you can remove the "or with the ctrlr->cache_lock already held"
since it's no longer true.
