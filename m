While I see why you need to toggle this feature, I'd rather try to
figure out whether there is a better solution that does not break the
single kernel image aim (i.e. the same config works for all supported
SoCs).

When we decided to go ahead with a static 1GB ZONE_DMA for Raspberry Pi
4, we thought that other platforms would be fine, ZONE_DMA32 allocations
fall back to ZONE_DMA. We missed the large CMA case.

I see a few potential options:

a) Ensure the CMA is contained within a single zone. How large is it in
   your case? Is it allocated by the kernel dynamically or a fixed start
   set by the boot loader?

b) Change the CMA allocator to allow spanning multiple zones (last time
   I looked it wasn't trivial since it relied on some per-zone lock).

c) Make ZONE_DMA dynamic on arm64 and only enable it if RPi4.
