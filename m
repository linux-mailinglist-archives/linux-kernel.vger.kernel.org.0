True.  So even with the content of this patch, I should at least touch
up the comment but I obviously missed that.  Though when reading
through the reply I think it's the patch content that might need a
fixup rather than the comment...

Indeed at least the ARC code has more functional change than what has
been stated in the commit message (which is only about faster signal
handling).  I wasn't paying much attention before because I don't see
"multiple retries" a big problem here and after all that's what we
finally want to achieve with the follow up patches... But I agree that
maybe I should be even more explicit in this patch.  Do you think
below change (to be squashed into this patch) looks good to you?
That's also an example only with ARC architecture but I can do similar
things to the other archs if you prefer:

                /*
                 * if fault retry, mmap_sem already relinquished by core mm
                 * so OK to return to user mode (with signal handled first)
                 */
-               return;
+               if (user_mode(regs))
+                       return;

Should we still be able to react on signal_pending() as part of fault
handling (because that's what this patch wants to do, at least for an
user-mode page fault)?  Please kindly correct me if I misunderstood...
