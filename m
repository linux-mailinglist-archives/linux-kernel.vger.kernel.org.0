Uh, is it any different from base pages which have to pass the same check? I
guess the caller could do e.g. lru_add_drain_all() first.

My point is that we should not accept compound pages that are neither a
migratable hugetlbfs page nor a THP, as movable. And your PageTransHuge() test
and my PageTransCompound() is really just a test for all compound pages, not
"hugetlbfs or THP only". I should have perhaps suggested PageCompound() instead
of the PageTransCompound() wrapper, to make it more obvious.

So we should test non-hugetlbfs pages first whether they are the kind of
compound pages that are migratable. THP's should pass this test by PageLRU(),
other compound movable pages by __PageMovable(head).
