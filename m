Including alternatives, which are what get me worried since the potential
for recursion is pretty high there (on arm64, at least).

I think that it would be nice not to end up with two very different
interfaces for this. But I see this is still just an RFC, so maybe the
full picture will emerge once we solve more of these use-cases.

Hmm. Wouldn't this sync also need to drain the trace buffers for all other
CPUs so that we make sure that the upcoming TEXT_POKE event occurs after
all prior trace data, which could've been from before the breakpoint was
installed?

Yes, thank you for explaining it!
