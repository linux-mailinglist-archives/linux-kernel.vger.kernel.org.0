The first fix(es) didn't work with the issue reported in [2], which
was in turn very similar to that in [1].  Since I didn't know why, I
couldn't be sure that the first fix was correct and did not introduce
other issues.

> Have they been in -next?

Nope. I proposed the full series in this thread, the day after the
full fix was confirmed to work.  I didn't propose any partial series
patch before, for the above reason.

I guess they should, as fixes to bugs that may cause crashes.  If
there are other rules for these tags, I'm sorry but I'm not aware of
them.

> All of them, some of them?

The only two non-fix patches are non-functional, trivial code
improvements made along the way.

Submitting a V2.

Thanks,
Paolo
