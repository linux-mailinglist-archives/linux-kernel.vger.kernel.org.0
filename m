In addition, here's an example of how I think it might be useful to=20
expose it to apps at large in a way that's compatible with existing=20
pthread mutexes:

https://github.com/Plagman/glibc/commit/3b01145fa25987f2f93e7eda7f3e7d0f2f7=
7b290

This patch hasn't received nearly as much testing as the Wine fsync code=20
path, but that functionality would provide more CPU-efficient ways for=20
thread pool code to sleep in our game engine. We also use eventfd today.

For this, I think the expected upper bound for the per-op futex count=20
would be in the same order of magnitude as the logical CPU count on the=20
target machine, similar as the Wine use-case.
