Thanks for listing out your usecase.

This is interesting. If scheduler has the knowledge of AVX512 tasks then
with these interface the scheduler can refrain from picking such core
occupying AVX512 tasks for the task with "latency-nice = -19".

So I guess for this specific use-case, the value for such per-task
attribute should have range (most probably [-19,20]) and the name
"latency-nice" also suits the need.

Do you have any specific values in mind for such attr?


Thanks,
Parth
