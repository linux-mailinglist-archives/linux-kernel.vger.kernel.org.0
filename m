Pretty much.

Only if that enterprise database:
1) has a controlling terminal (a strange condition for a daemon, IMHO)
2) that terminal has the status character set in the struct termios.

A quick google got me this document:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b32009.pdf
It only ever mentions CHLD, CONT, INT, PIPE, TERM, URG and IO.

I have no real experience with neither DB2 nor Oracle DB, though, and no
way to get hold of that kind of software, so I don't know where to look
further. If we'd like to be really sure no one's hurt we'll need someone
with actual expertise here.
