Right.  I thought these details could be hidden from the API layer so
timer users won't need to know these details (neither about NOHZ, nor
about the fact that the action of queuing the timer is the thing that
really matters, because add_timer_on() can hide all these), but it's
also ok to me if you prefer them to be exposed to the users.

Yes, let me give it another shot soon...  Thanks,
