We're not disputing the sanity of compiler folk; Will did not say
anything about that.

The warning is unhelpful in the case of the [0 ... MAXIDX] = <default>
idiom, and the modification you suggest:

* Makes the code harder to read.

* Increases the necessary context. e.g. I must know the specific values
  of the enum to know that ICACHE_POLICY_VPIPT + 1 is the unallocated
  slot.

* Less robust. If the enum gets re-ordered, we must update the array.
  If the enum is expanded, new elements must be added to the array to
  initialize entries to the default value, which also makes the code
  more verbose and painful to read. IIUC if we don't explicitly
  initialize an element, we won't get a warning, which would be harmful.

If there's some way to mark the default initialization as overridable,
I think that would be fine, e.g.

struct foo *array[] = {
	[0 ... MAXIDX] __default = <default>,
	[SOMEIDX] = <someval>,
	[OTHERIDX] = <otherval>,
}

We have a number of cases where the [0 ... MAXIDX] = <default> idiom are
used, and I don't think that any of them should be changed in the manner
suggested by this patch.


Thanks,
Mark.
