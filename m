I still don't get why you need this.

If it's MFD, you may use "serial8250" with a given platform data like dozens of
current users do.

Another approach is to use 8250 library, thus, creating a specific glue driver
(like all 8250_* do).

Yes, I understand that 8250 driver is full of quirks and not modern approaches
to do one or another thing. Unfortunately it's not too easy to fix it without
uglifying code and doing some kind of ping-pong thru the conversion. I don't
think it worth to do it in the current state of affairs. Though, cleaning up
the core part from the quirks and custom pieces would make this task
achievable.

I'm also puzzled why you don't use FPGA manager which should handle, as far as
I understand, very flexible configurations of FPGAs.

Btw, what exact IP of UART do you have implemented there?
