Agreed

I would really refrain from adding whatever measure to silence some
tool without a deeper understanding of why that is needed. $FOO_ONCE
will prevent compiler from making funcy stuff. But this is an int and
I would be really surprised if $FOO_ONCE made any practical difference.

I would have to think more about this but this surely sounds like a
preferable way than adding $FOO_ONCE to silence the tool.

Thanks!
