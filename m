This change looks correct -- it just gets us directly to the panic()
state instead of exercising the various exception handlers.

I don't think reordering these is a good idea: as the comments say,
there might be work done in the notifier chain that kmsg_dump() will
want to capture (e.g. the KASLR base offset).

The situation seems to be that notifier callbacks must return -- I think
Xen needs fixing here.
