Due to power rail dependencies, the SoundWire Master driver cannot
make decisions on its own when entering pm runtime suspend.

Add quirk mask for each link, so that the SOF parent driver can inform
the SoundWire master driver of the desired behavior:
a) leave clock on
b) power-off instead of clock stop
c) power-off if all devices cannot generate wakes
d) force bus reset on clock restart

Note that for now the interface with the SOF driver relies on a single
mask for all links. If needed, the interface might be modified at a
later point to provide more freedom. The code at the lower level does
not assume any commonality between links.
