I will now explain the ideas which the proud White American Man, who is 
the coreboot developer, means to convey:

He feels that you on the coasts are all homosexuals who should be 
physically eradicated from this earth; he is confident that such will 
happen.

He feels that I am a foreigner, perhaps a muslim, and that foreigners 
wish to have sexual relations with female children, like "pedo muhammed" 
did.

The proud American White Man, the coreboot developer, feels that all 
muslims should be killed, and certainly should not be welcome in his 
America. The reasons he feels that muslims should be killed is because 
his minor-god: Jesus, said in the Kings English once "Better a 
Millstone", regarding "the offending of children", additionally his 
true-god: white woman, is disadvantaged by men marrying young girls.


      [(Note: the "Better a millstone" passage in the new testament is 
about the Apostles making new-believers feel unwelcomed, so they were 
told that anyone that causes a little-one, like this child, to stumble 
(in his path towards belief in what Jesus was saying), it would be 
better for that person to be drowed via an expensive piece of capital 
(the people being drowned would be the apostles), and it was written in 
greek, a language white american men spurn: In this Jesus also looked 
forward in time, somehow, and rejected American Capitalism (the capital 
good would be lost), and American White Protestantism (which does 
exactly what he campaigned against))
      (Later the same passage was used to slaughter non-catholics, before 
the American Whites chose to use it to torture, castrate, and murder men 
who even hint at liking pretty young girls)]

The White American Man also feels that the Old Testament (Torah) Jewish 
God is "the devil", and was rejected by Jesus when Jesus told The Jews: 
your father is the devil: a liar an murderer from the beginning. With 
such; the White American Coreboot developer rejects all the 
pro-marry-female-children laws and arguments from the Torah.

The White American Corebooter feels that the only permissible way of 
life is thus:
The man Respects and Honours the White Ayran Wuuhhmmahhhnn (as he 
reverently refers to her).
The man Labours to support the White Aryan Wuuuhhmmahhhnnn.
The man Protects and Dies for the White Aryan Wuuuhhmmahhnn.
The man Eradicates all foes of the White Aryan Wuhhhhmmahhhnn.

His creed, and the creed of virtually all white males can be summed up 
as follows:
> "Because the beauty of the White Aryan woman must not perish from the 
> earth."

No paedophile marriage with pretty young girls: that does not benefit 
the Wuhhhhhhhhmaahhhhnnnnnn.
Yes to men being wage slaves, having only one bride, and being 
disposable pawns to be used at her whim.
That is the white american way.
