Because platform_get_resource() is a generally available and useful
helper function for working with platform_device resources, that the
current standard serial8250 driver does not support.

I am uncertain if I still haven't convinced you that current serial8250
driver does not work with platform_get_resource(), or if you believe
that it really should not support it.

There is only one in-tree mfd driver using "serial8250", the sm501.c
driver.  And that driver predates the mfd framework (mfd-core.c) by a
year, and does not use any of the mfd-core functionality.

I want to use the mfd-core provided handling of resource splitting,
because it makes it easier to handle splitting of a single memory
resource as defined by a PCI BAR in this case.  And the other drivers I
need to use all support/use platform_get_resource(), so it would even
have an impact on the integration of that if I cannot use mfd resource
splitting with serial8250.

As mentioned, I think this is a bad approach, and I would prefer to
improve the "serial8250" driver instead.  But if you insist, what should
I call such a driver?  It needs a platform_driver name, for use when
matching with platform_device devices.  And it would support exactly the
same hardware as the current "serial8250" driver.

I think it should be possible and worthwhile to improve serial8250
driver with support for using platform_device resources
(platform_get_resource() helper).

If we could stop discussing if it is a proper thing to do, we could try
to find a good way to do it instead.

FPGA manager is for programming FPGA's.  The FPGA's used in this project
read their configuration from EEPROM.

I don't see any overlap of FPGA manager with MFD.  They server
completely different purposes, and could very well both be used for the
same FPGA's.

It is an XPS 16550 UART (v3.00a).
https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/xps_uart16550.pdf

There are 5 of them in one FPGA, together with 3 XPS LL TEMAC Ethernet
IP blocks, an IRQ controller, and a number of custom IP blocks.
