That's a lost change issue. I'll try to be more diligent in the
future.  My dev workspace  is disconnected from the kernel used for
upstreaming patches, so if i make a change in one it isn't always
reflected in the other.  I'm working on rectifying the underlying
build space issue to let me use the same repo.
