I think the currently executing task cannot be pushed out of a
CPU/core, right?

So, if a task switches from SCHED_OTHER to SCHED_DEADLINE while it is
executing on a fast core, the only way to migrate it would be to
preempt it (by using the stop_sched_class, I think), no?
(the typical situation here is a "cpu hog" task that switches from
SCHED_OTHER to SCHED_DEADLINE, and it is the only SCHED_DEADLINE
task... The task never blocks, so push/pull functions are never invoked)

Or am I missing something?



			Thanks,
				Luca
