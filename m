Thank you for your patience and explanations. I've been being conservative
as I'm not a "seasoned, Linux professional" and am still getting my
git send-email config / command line for Linux properly straightened out.

Should I send another patch set with the `kbuild...` tag removed,
or would it be removed in the process of an appropriate member
of the Linux MTD team adding their tag for approval, if and when
that happens?

Jeff
