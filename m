Changes since v1 [1]:
- Simplify the profile to a hopefully non-controversial set of
  attributes that address the most common sources of contributor
  confusion, or maintainer frustration.
- Rename "Subsystem Profile" to "Maintainer Entry Profile". Not every
  entry in MAINTAINERS represents a full subsystem. There may be driver
  local considerations to communicate to a submitter in addition to wider
  subsystem guidelines. 
- Delete the old P: tag in MAINTAINERS rather than convert to a new E:
  tag (Joe Perches).

At last years Plumbers Conference I proposed the Maintainer Entry
Profile as a document that a maintainer can provide to set contributor
expectations and provide fodder for a discussion between maintainers
about the merits of different maintainer policies.

For those that did not attend, the goal of the Maintainer Entry Profile,
and the Maintainer Handbook more generally, is to provide a desk
reference for maintainers both new and experienced. The session
introduction was:

    The first rule of kernel maintenance is that there are no hard and
    fast rules. That state of affairs is both a blessing and a curse. It
    has served the community well to be adaptable to the different
    people and different problem spaces that inhabit the kernel
    community. However, that variability also leads to inconsistent
    experiences for contributors, little to no guidance for new
    contributors, and unnecessary stress on current maintainers. There
    are quite a few of people who have been around long enough to make
    enough mistakes that they have gained some hard earned proficiency.
    However if the kernel community expects to keep growing it needs to
    be able both scale the maintainers it has and ramp new ones without
    necessarily let them make a decades worth of mistakes to learn the
    ropes. 

To be clear, the proposed document does not impose or suggest new
rules. Instead it provides an outlet to document the unwritten rules
and policies in effect for each subsystem, and that each subsystem
might decide differently for whatever reason.
