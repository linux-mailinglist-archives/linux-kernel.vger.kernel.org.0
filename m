Right.

There is _far_ more text poking than just jump_label's NOP/JMP
transitions. Ftrace also does NOP/CALL, CALL/CALL, and the static_call
infrastructure that I posted here:

  https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20191007082708.013939311@infradead.org

Has: JMP/RET, JMP/JMP and if it has inline patching support: NOP/CALL,
CALL/CALL, patching.

Anyway, the below argument doesn't care much, it works for NOP/JMP just
fine.

So the problem we have with PT is that it is a bit-stream of
branch taken/not-taken decisions. In order to decode that we need to
have an accurate view of the unconditional code flow.

Both NOP/JMP are unconditional and we need to exactly know which of the
two was encountered.

With your scheme, I don't see how we can ever actually know that. When
we get the PRE event, all we really know is that we're going to change
a specific instruction into another. And at the POST event we know it
has been done. But in between these two events, we have no clue which of
the two instructions is live on which CPU (two CPUs might in fact have a
different live instruction at the same time).

This means we _cannot_ unambiguously decode a taken/not-taken decision
stream.

Does CS have this same problem, and how would the PRE/POST events help
with that?

So our (x86) horrible (variable instruction length induced) complexity
for text poking is actually in our advantage this one time. The
exception and exception-return paths allow us to unambiguously know what
happens around the time of poking.
