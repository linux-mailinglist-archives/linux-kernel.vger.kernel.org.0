Well, worst case requires non-trivial workload because lru_add_drain_all
skips cpus where vectors are empty. Something must constantly generates
flow of pages at each cpu. Also cpus must be busy to make scheduling per-cpu
works slower. And machine must be big enough (64+ cpus in our case).

In our case that was massive series of mlock calls in map-reduce while other
tasks writes log (and generates flow of new pages in per-cpu vectors). Mlock
calls were serialized by mutex and accumulated latency up to 10 second and more.

Kernel does not call lru_add_drain_all on mlock paths since 4.15, but same scenario
could be triggered by fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) or any other remaining user.
