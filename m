Hm, I don't quite understand this reasoning. Yes, there are two models
for unmapped and mapped file pages. But both types of pages get
activated with two or more references: for unmapped it's tracked
through mark_page_accessed(), and for mapped it's the two LRU cycles
with the referenced bit set (unmapped pages don't get that extra trip
around the LRU with one reference). With that alone, mapped pages and
unmapped pages should have equal chances, no?

You do have a point here, though.

The VM_EXEC protection is a heuristic that I think was added for one
specific case. Instead of adopting it straight-away for anon pages, it
may be good to wait until a usecase materializes. If it never does,
all the better - one less heuristic to carry around.

That sounds like a good plan. I'm looking forward to the next version!
