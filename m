Any machines with more than one numa node will start reporting this error.

1) many virtual deivces maybe do not set the node id before calling
   device_register(), such as vfio, tun, etc.

2) struct cpu has a dev, but does not set the dev' node according to
   cpu_to_node().

3) Many platform Device also do not have a node id provided by FW.
