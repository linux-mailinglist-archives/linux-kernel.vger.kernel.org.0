They are indeed not implemented on some GPUs. Specifically none of the
Midgard GPUs. I believe G71 also doesn't have it. However the register
addresses were picked so that on these older GPUs they should
read-as-zero and write-ignore so this shouldn't actually cause any
problems.

Indeed - I'll post a patch removing it.
