So I think the thing really is dying on a sched_group->sgc deref (pahole says
sgc is at offset #16), which means we have a NULL sched_group somewhere, but
I don't see how. That can either be 'local' (can't be, first group we visit
and doesn't go through update_pick_idlest()) or 'idlest' (see previous email).

Now, it's bedtime for me, if you get the chance in the meantime can you give
this a shot? I was about to send it out but realized it didn't really make
sense, but you never know...

Also, if it is indeed misfit related, I'm surprised we (Arm folks) haven't
hit it sooner. We've had our scheduler tests running on the LB rework for at
least a month, so we should've hit it.
