This is all quite vague and requires a lot of guessing. Also your
trained guess eye might easily get confused for constrained OOMs (e.g.
due to NUMA or memcg). So I am not really sold to the percentage idea.
And likewise the oom_score.

I do agree here. As I've said in the previous email oom_score_adj indeed
has some value, and this is a nice example of that. So I am completely
fine with a patch that adds this part to the changelog.

While I appreciate that you are flexible enough to cope with those
changes there are other users which might be less so and there is a
strong "no regressions" rule which might get us into the corner so we
are trying hard to not export to much of an internal information so that
userspace doesn't start depending on them.

The idea is that we would have to try to fit oom_score_adj semantic into
a new algoritm and -1000..1000 value range would be hopefully good
enough. That doesn't really dictate the internal calculation of the
badness, if such a theretical alg. would use at all.

Yes, the scaling just happened to work back then.

The point I am trying to push through is that the score (exported via
proc or displayed via dump_tasks) is valuable only as far as you have a
meaningful comparision to make - aka compare to scores of other tasks.
The value on its own cannot tell you really much without a deep
understanding of how it is calculated. And I absolutely do not want
userspace to hardcode that alg. and rely on it being stable. You really
do not need this internal knowledge when comparing scores of different
tasks, though so it is quite safe and robust from future changes.

We have made those mistakes when exporting way to much internal details
to userspace in the past and got burnt.

I am willing to ack a patch to add oom_score_adj on the grounds that
this information is helpful to pinpoint misconfigurations and it is not
generally available when dump_tasks is disabled.

I am not convinced on oom_score and percentage part because score on its
own is an implementation detail that makes sense when comparing tasks
but on on its own and percentage might be even confusing as explained
above.

Thanks for your detailed information!
