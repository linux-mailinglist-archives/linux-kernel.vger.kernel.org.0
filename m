Dear Greg,
Thanks a lot for suggestion. I will add more information in these help texts and send PATCH V3 soon.
Furthermore, of cause it is better to make these values dynamic and grow as needed by the system. A possible way is to manage memory and port resource by a dynamic list instead of a static array.
But it costs more time to design and implement a better scheme. I will try it later and push patchs when it's finished.
This patch is a temporary way better than nothing, and I hope it could be accept.

thanks,
Qiang Su

Can you provide a lot more information in these help texts?  Explain why you would ever want to change these values, and that if you do not understand, just take the default ones.

Or, better yet, can we just make these values dynamic and grow as needed by the system?  Why are they "fixed"?

thanks,

greg k-h
