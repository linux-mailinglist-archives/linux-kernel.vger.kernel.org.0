Plumbing this into edac as a 'device' gives you the existing/standard interface for
user-space. For example the 'panic_on_ue' that is exposed via sysfs, this saves you having
another interface to toggle it for your driver. You can then use the existing distro tools
to drive/monitor/sample it.

I don't think corrected/uncorrected helps here. If the register is read-only, and software
writes to it, its a software bug.

(from the v8.2's RAS extensions view, its somewhere between unrecoverable and uncontained)

If EDAC doesn't do what you need, it can always be extended.

Sure, (its for memory controllers, but:) enum edac_type has a EDAC_EC: "Error Checking, no
correction". This wouldn't be the only device that only reports uncorrectable errors.

I think this device is an example of something like a "Fabric switch units" in
Documentation/driver-api/edac.rst. It makes sense that it should be described as a
'device' to edac. You can then use the existing user-space tools to control/report/monitor
the values.


Thanks,
