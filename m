Hi Matt,

Thanks for the patches.  This looks like a good step in the right
direction.

What's the performance difference between the old recordmcount and the
new version which relies on elf_open()?  It would be useful to compare
kernel build times, before and after.

Would it be feasible to eventually combine subcommands so that objtool
could do both ORC and mcount generation in a single invocation?  I
wonder what what the interface would look like.
