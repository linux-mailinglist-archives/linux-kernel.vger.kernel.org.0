Would be great if someone from Rockchip could give some insights whether
and when during reboot GRF_IO_VSEL is reset (ATF before reboot, some SoC
soft-reset, ROM bootloader, rkminiloader, something different), Shawn?
Or gets this VSEL changed only when switching the voltage regulator (via
io_domains,sdmmc-supply)?
