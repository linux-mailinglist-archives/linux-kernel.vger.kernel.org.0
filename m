There is one problem though: Do we assume that only the kernel driver 
will communicate with the TPM or might there be something else that also 
talks to the TPM?

If it is only the kernel driver, we could probably skip setting 
TPM_LOC_SEL at all, since it defaults to 0 and the driver will never use 
anything else. If something else does its own I2C communication with the 
TPM, it might write different values to TPM_LOC_SEL at any time, causing 
the kernel driver to use a different locality than intended. This was 
the reason I always set TPM_LOC_SEL within the same transaction.

Interrupt support might be broken in general at the moment, see this 
thread: https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-integrity/msg08663.html

I won't have the time to do anything, at least for the next two weeks, 
so feel free to pick it up.

If multi-master usage is a concern, there are probably a lot more places 
in the driver that need to be adapted to deal with concurrent 
access/data corruption. For now, I'd assume a single master, similar to SPI.
