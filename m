Hello,

I thought that initially, but I was wrong. It seems like that these 
multi-node CPUs are reporting SOC and Core voltage/current data at 
particular node. Look at this HWiNFO64 screenshot of 2990WX for 
reference: https://i.imgur.com/yM9X5nd.jpg . They also may be using 
different addresses and/or factors.

I was aware of 0005995c and I thought that it could be Tdie3 (that's why 
I have included it in debug output, someone already shared that 3960X is 
reporting data on that address). I think this one can be safely included.

I was not aware of the other address, I will try it.

Ondrej.
