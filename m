Got it, I believe people won't be confused with calc_region_size().
It's fine to me.

OK, you mean parsing SRAT again before kernel_randomize_memory(). I
think this is what Masa made this patchset to avoid. Then we will have
three times SRAT parsing. Passing the max addr from boot to
kernel_randomize_memory() was raised when review Chao Fan's patchset, I
vaguely remember. Chao didn't take the SRAT parsing way in boot code
firstly, later someone suggested to parse, and said the issue in
kernel_randomize_memory() can be fixed with the parsed value.

Surely, parsing SRAT here is also good. Maybe Masa can make a draft
patch, let people see what it looks like.

Thanks
