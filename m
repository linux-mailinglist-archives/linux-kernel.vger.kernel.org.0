I considered the CPU mask but it's expensive.

I either have to create a percpu variable, or allocate something at every call
here. Neither of which seemed acceptable to me.

Recording the idx is simple and cheap IMO.

I don't see if going through the loop twice will help here. The proces is racy,
and I think by the time we reached here we would have tried hard enough to find
the best cpu to run on?
