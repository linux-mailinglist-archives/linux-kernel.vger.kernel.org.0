AFAIA what matters here is memory controllers, less so LLCs. Cores within
a single die could have private LLCs and separate memory controllers, or
shared LLC and separate memory controllers.

Right, and that is checked when you have sched_debug on the cmdline
(or write 1 to /sys/kernel/debug/sched_debug & regenerate the sched domains)

Now, I don't know how this plays out for the numa-in-package topologies like
the one suggested by Sudeep. x86 and AMD had to play some games to get
numa-in-package topologies working, see e.g.

  cebf15eb09a2 ("x86, sched: Add new topology for multi-NUMA-node CPUs")

perhaps you need to "lie" here and ensure sub-NUMA sched domain levels are
a subset of the NUMA levels, i.e. lie for core_siblings. I might go and
play with this to see how it behaves.
