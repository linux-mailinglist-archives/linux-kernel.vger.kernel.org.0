Indeed. But to be honest, we should probably consider moving all the 
SGI
handling to normal interrupts. There's hardly any reason why we should 
keep
SGIs out of the normal interrupt model, other than maybe performance 
(and
that's pretty dubious).

There is no guarantee whatsoever. There's an ARM recommendation about 
the
above split, but that's it. Hardly something that can be enforced.

Now, your firmware is the one that gives you the DT, so if it is 
inconsistent
in configuring the interrupt and presenting it to the kernel, tough 
luck.

You can try and change the configuration of that interrupt (priority, 
for
example), and see if that sticks. If it doesn't, you're in trouble (and
nothing you can do about it).

That's indeed my worry. There is also the fact that the kernel itself 
will
never expose such reservation in DT, so we'd have to tread carefully 
here.
We probably need to specify that *only* SGI8-15 are allowed to be 
described
as such.

Another thing: why don't you use a PPI? If you use a GICv2, you're also 
using
ancient cores, and they have PPIs to spare. Or do you rely on being 
able to
inject interrupts from one core to another?

Thanks,
