But isn't this something that applies to all TPMs, not only cr50? So 
shouldn't this parameter be added to one of the global modules (tpm? 
tpm_tis_core?) instead? Or do all low-level drivers (tpm_tis, 
tpm_tis_spi, ...) need this parameter to provide a consistent interface 
for the user?

No, this was meant as an example for the previous question. As far as I 
understood it, cr50 is basically compliant to the spec implemented by 
tpm_tis_spi, but needs special handling in some cases. Therefore, I'd 
expect a driver for cr50 to look exactly like tpm_tis_spi except for the 
special bits here and there. The way buffers are allocated within the 
driver is probably not something that should differ because of the TPM chip.
