Quite a few points to make here:

 - TLB shootdown as MMIO is a problem when you start trying to do it
directly from guests (which is very desirable). I can elaborate if you
want, but it generally boils down to having a pile of copies of the
MMIO resources to assign to guests and having to constantly change
mappings which is unrealistic.

 - I generally have very serious doubts as to the value of doing
broadcast TLB shootdowns in HW. I went at lenght about it during Linux
Plumbers Conference, but I'll try to summarise here, from my experience
back at IBM working on POWER. In no special order:

   * It doesn't scale well. You have to drain all the target CPU queues
of already translated load stores, keep ordering, etc... it causes a
giant fabric traffic jam. Experience has shown that on some POWER
systems, it becomes extremely expensive.

   * Some OS such as Linux track which CPU has seen a given context.
That allows to "target" TLB invalidations in a more sensible way.
Broadcast instructions tend to lose that ability (it's hard to do in HW
esp. in a way that can be virtualized properly).

   * Because those instructions can take a very long time (for the
above reasons and some of below ones), or at least whatever context
synchronizing instruction that follow which waits for completion of the
invalidations, you end up with a CPU effectively "stuck" for a long
time, not taking interrupts, including those routed to higher priority
levels (ie. hypervisor etc...). This is problematic. A completion
polling mechanism is preferable so that once can still handle such work
while waiting but is hard to architect/implement properly when done as
"instructions" since they can happen concurrently from multiple
contexts. It's easier with MMIO but that has other issues.

   * It introduces races with anything that does SW walk of page
tables. For example MMIO emulation by a hypervisor cannot be done race-
free if the guest can do its own broadcast invalidations and the
hypervisor has to walk the guest page tables to translate. I can
elaborate if requested.

   * Those invalidations need to also target nest agents that can hold
translations, such as IOMMUs that can operate in usr contexts etc...
Such IOMMUs can take a VERY LONG time to process invalidations,
especially if translations have been checked out by devices such as
PCIe devices using ATS. Some GPUs for example can hit a worst case of
hundreds of *milliseconds* to process a TLB invalidation.

 - Now for the proposed scheme. I really don't like introducing a *new*
way of tagging an address space using the PPN. It's a hack. The right
way is to ensure that the existing context tags are big enough to not
require re-use and thus can be treated as global context tags by the
hypervisor and OS. IE. have big enough VMIDs and ASIDs that each
running VM can have a global stable VMID and each process within a
given VM can have a global (within that VM) ASID instead of playing
reallocation of ASID tricks at context switch (that's very inefficient
anyway, so that should be fixed for anything that claims performance
and scalability).

Now all of these things can probably have solutions but experience
doesn't seem to indicate that it's really worthwhile. We are better off
making sure we have a really fast IPI path to perform those via
interrupts and locally to the targetted CPUs IMHO.

Cheers,
Ben.
