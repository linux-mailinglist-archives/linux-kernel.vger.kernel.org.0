IC. I wasn't aware of the new pata_buddha.c driver not working at all
when builtin.

Right. Please note that most drivers for Zorro boards predate the device
driver framework, and thus all started life using zorro_find_device().
But this did have the advantage of supporting multi-function cards
out-of-the-box.
Later, several drivers were converted to the new driver framework.
but not all of them, due to multi-function cards.

In the short run: keep on using drivers/ide/buddha.c?

Your single Buddha should be sufficient to convert pata_buddha.c from
a plain Zorro driver to an MFD cell driver, and test it.
I expect the buddha-mfd.c MFD driver from my zorro-mfd branch to
work as-is, or with very minor changes.

However, to keep X-Surf working, this needs to be synchronized with
a Zorro MFD conversion of the zorro8390 driver, too.

Yes, the clockport could be added as an extra MFD cell.  Later, drivers can
be written to bind against the clockport cell.

Thanks!
