Cc Yafang, who made (most of?) these updates.

Thanks, patch 1 fixes the script for me for all tracepoints you touched.

Nit, not for Pages Scanned.  With your series I get

Kswapd          Kswapd      Order      Pages     Pages    Pages    Pages

I wonder if we shouldn't just get rid of the whole script, it's hard to
remember to keep in sync with vmscan changes and I can't think of a way to
remedy that short of having mm regression tests that run this.  But your
patches are an improvement for now.
