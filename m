Hi, Mel,

Thanks a lot for your review!

This adds rate limit to NUMA migration between the different
types of memory nodes only (e.g. from PMEM to DRAM), but not between the
same types of memory nodes (e.g. from DRAM to DRAM).  Sorry for
confusing patch subject.  I will change it in the next version.

And, rate limit is an inherent part of the algorithm used in the
patchset.  Because we just use LRU algorithm to find the cold pages on
the fast memory node (e.g. DRAM), and use NUMA hint page fault latency
to find the hot pages on the slow memory node (e.g. PMEM).  But we don't
compare the temperature between the cold DRAM pages and the hot PMEM
pages.  Instead, we just try to exchange some cold DRAM pages and some
hot PMEM pages, even if the cold DRAM pages is hotter than the hot PMEM
pages.  The rate limit is used to control how many pages to exchange
between DRAM and PMEM per second.  This isn't perfect, but it works well
in our testing.

Best Regards,
Huang, Ying
