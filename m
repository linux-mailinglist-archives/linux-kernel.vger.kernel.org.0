I understand now.  I missed the connection between these drivers and the
Kbuild change when I read this last night.  Sorry about that.

I can send the changes to those four files, but since I can't guarantee
they will be merged quickly (or at all!) - that will leave the commit in
the Kbuild tree causing build regressions for days or likely even weeks.

I will be happy to send them, but we just opened the two week merge
window, and a lot of maintainers don't like getting sent new patches
until the two week merge window has closed - so we should avoid that.

I'm not sure how you would like to proceed - one way would be that we
get the drivers above changed in 5.2 and you delay your kbuild change
until we start v5.3 - to that end I'd be happy to add the Kbuild change
to my internal build testing in the meantime, if you would like.

Now that I understand the problem, let me know what you would like to
do, and I'll do what I can to help out.

Thanks,
Paul.
