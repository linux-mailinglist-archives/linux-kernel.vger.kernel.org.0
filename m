But shouldn’t remote wakeup signaling wakes the device up and let it exit  
suspend state?
Or it’s okay to let the device be suspended when remote wakeup is needed  
but broken?

So if a device is broken when “power/control” is flipped by user, we should  
deal it at userspace? That doesn’t sound right to me.

I am not asking the suspended state to work as full power, but to prevent a  
device enters suspend state because of broken remote wakeup.

I really don’t think “loss of functionally” belongs to policy decision. But  
that’s just my opinion.

Ok, I’ll take a look at other device drivers that use it.

Maybe just calling usb_autopm_put_interface() in usbhid_close() to balance  
the refcount?

I’d also like to hear maintainers' opinion on this issue.
