One overall optimization idea?

Should we add two API calls:

rpmh_start_operations()
rpmh_end_operations()

These optional API calls would be an optimization a client could use.
When rpmh_start_operations() is called then RPMH code will inhibit
flushing (but will still update the "dirty" flag).  When
rpmh_end_operations() is called then the RPMH will flush if the dirty
flag is set.

This is a pretty simple concept but should have a huge impact in the
number of times we program hardware in non-OSI mode.  Specifically, if
we don't do that and we look at what happens in the interconnect code:

1. We "invalidate" the batch.  We have to flush the non-batch commands
back into the hardware.

2. We program the "wake only" commands.  We have to flush the batch
wake-only commands and also the non-batch commands back into the
hardware.

3. We program the "sleep only" commands.  We have to flush yet again
with everything.
