I don't know ... all cases are special and all cases are normal
depending on who you ask or when. The normal case of today can be the
special case of tomorrow and vice versa.

This way the people that would be willing to put in extra effort to
maintain compatibility wouldn't be able to achieve the goal.

Yes, Xen does it just fine. But if you boot Linux with the same DT but
without Xen, problems occur.

The code looked suboptimal to me because of the reasons I listed in the
commit message. I thought it was done this way by "mistake". However, I
now realize that if it is written this way on purpose, then I have a
very little chance of convincing you to change it.
