Yes there are platforms that have a regulator under Linux's control. On
those devm_regulator_get(_optional) will of course return that regulator
and the panfrost driver will use regulator_set_voltage() to set the
voltage as appropriate.

You are also correct that HiKey does not (yet) have this enabled
upstream - hence my questions about whether there is a better way of
representing this in device tree than just omitting the regulator.

Ok, the current code in drm-misc will indeed not try to set anything if
there's no regulator.

It's not my present concern - but it may be worth changing the calls to
regulator_set_voltage to specify a range as you suggest.

The problem on the Hikey960 is that the voltage control is not done by
Linux. At the moment I have a DT with a set of operating-points:

	operating-points = <
		/* <frequency> <voltage>*/
		178000  650000
		400000	700000
		533000	800000
		807000	900000
		960000	1000000
		1037000 1100000
	>;

But while Linux can set the frequency (via the mailbox interface) the
voltages are not set by Linux but are implicit by choosing a frequency.
At the moment my DT has a clock but no regulator and with the code in
drm-next this works.

Your change swapping devm_regulator_get_optional() to
devm_regulator_get() breaks this because that will return a dummy
regulator which will reject any regulator_set_voltage() calls.

I don't currently see how I can write a DT configuration for the
Hikey960 which would work with the devm_regulator_get() call.

To be honest I've no idea how to use the generic OPP code to do this. I
suspect the original open coding was cargo-culted from another driver:
the comments in the function look like they were lifted from
drivers/devfreq/rk3399_dmc.c. Any help tidying this up would be appreciated.

Good point - although if it's possible to switch to generic OPP code
that would be even better.

Thanks,
