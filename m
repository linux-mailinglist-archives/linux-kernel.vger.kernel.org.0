I think I found the reason: we only hit the build failure with one
special config used for zfcpdump which has

  CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y

When I switched to CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE=y (which we have
in other s390x configs and which most people probably prefer), the build
does not fail even without the patch.
