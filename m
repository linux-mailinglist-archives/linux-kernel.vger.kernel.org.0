But we'll still need it even with clang so that the relevant triple can be
passed to the --target option. The top-level Makefile already does this:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Makefile#n544

so I think we should do the same thing for the compat vdso as well, which
would allow us to remove this complexity by requiring that
CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT identifies the cross-compiler to use in exactly the
same way as CROSS_COMPILE does.

Am I missing something here?
