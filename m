Check the code for the dummy var, it is created only in below chunk:
arch/x86/platform/efi/quirks.c:
efi_query_variable_store():
[snip]
	/*
	 * We account for that by refusing the write if permitting it would
	 * reduce the available space to under 5KB. This figure was provided by
	 * Samsung, so should be safe.
	 */
	if ((remaining_size - size < EFI_MIN_RESERVE) &&
		!efi_no_storage_paranoia) {

		/*
		 * Triggering garbage collection may require that the firmware
		 * generate a real EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES error. We can force
		 * that by attempting to use more space than is available.
		 */
		unsigned long dummy_size = remaining_size + 1024;
		void *dummy = kzalloc(dummy_size, GFP_KERNEL);

		if (!dummy)
			return EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES;

		status = efi.set_variable((efi_char16_t *)efi_dummy_name,
					  &EFI_DUMMY_GUID,
					  EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE |
					  EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS |
					  EFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS,
					  dummy_size, dummy);

		if (status == EFI_SUCCESS) {
			/*
			 * This should have failed, so if it didn't make sure
			 * that we delete it...
			 */
			efi_delete_dummy_variable();
		}

[snip]

So the dummy var only be created when the if condition matched, also
once creating succeeded it is deleted.  The deleting while entering
virtual mode is always deleting a non exist efi var.  Please correct me
if I miss something. 

If above is true, then at least in the kexec path can be dropped because
we have a real bug which resets machine.

Thanks
Dave
