Let's consider this "invented store" scenario (even though as I noted in my
earlier email, I suspect this particular instance of the code does not appear
to fit the requirements to generate this in the wild with current compilers):

intial state:

sched_tgid_ref = 10;

Thread A                                Thread B

registration                            tracepoint probe
sched_tgid_ref++
  - compiler decides to invent a
    store: sched_tgid_ref = 0
                                        READ_ONCE(sched_tgid_ref) -> observes 0,
                                        but should really see either 10 or 11.
  - compiler stores 11 into
    sched_tgid_ref

This kind of scenario could cause spurious missing data in the middle of a
trace caused by another user trying to increment the reference count, which
is really unexpected.

A similar scenario can happen for "store tearing" if the compiler decides
to break the store into many stores close to the 16-bit overflow value when
updating a 32-bit reference count. Spurious 1 -> 0 -> 1 transitions could be
observed by readers.

If you choose not to use READ_ONCE(), then the "load tearing" issue can
cause similar spurious 1 -> 0 -> 1 transitions near 16-bit counter
overflow as described above. The "Invented load" also becomes an issue,
because the compiler could use the loaded value for a branch, and re-load
that value between two branches which are expected to use the same value,
effectively generating a corrupted state.

I think we need a statement about whether READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE should
be used in this kind of situation, or if we are fine dealing with the
awkward compiler side-effects when they will occur.

Thanks,

Mathieu
