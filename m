No, my point is that the pagefaulting is being provided by drm_gem_shmem
and that is relying on direct access to struct page, hence that is
imposing the restriction that it can only handle its own shmem objects.
The driver should not guess the helper, but ask the helper if it can
perform an mmap of this object, and since this object is not an shmem
object it will say no.

Different drivers can use their HW to fault in indirect access to dmabuf
(treating the dmabuf as a conveyance of a sglist and not struct page)
and so do not need to different/reject foreign objects from their
specialised mmap routines and are oblivious to them.
