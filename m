Yeah, this is much simpler.

In my patchset, in addition to the kernel patches, i also modify the kexec-tools.
  arm64: support more than one crash kernel regions(http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/kexec/2019-April/022792.html).
In kexec-tools patch, we read all the "Crash kernel" entry and load crash kernel high.

I did miss the bit of the crashkernel reservation. I will fix this in next version.
