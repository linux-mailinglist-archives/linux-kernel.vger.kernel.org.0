But this messes up consistency in the naming of sdw objects. I am all for
it, if we do sd for slave and name all structs and APIs accordingly. The key
is consistency!

So it needs to be sd/md and so on or sdw_slave and sdw_master and so
on... not a mix of both

I agree with you on not overloading but from a linux pov, we need names
which are consistent with each other...
