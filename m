Sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this.

I don't like to drive design by smaps. I agree with the word "mess" used
several times of THP tunings in this thread, but it's too easy to make
that mess worse by unnecessary changes, so I'm very cautious here.

The addition of "THPeligible" without an "Anon" in its name was
unfortunate. I suppose we're two releases too late to change that.

Applying process (PR_SET_THP_DISABLE) and mm (MADV_*HUGEPAGE)
limitations to shared filesystem objects doesn't work all that well.

I recommend that you continue to treat shmem objects separately from
anon memory, and just make the smaps "THPeligible" more often accurate.

Is your v2 patch earlier in this thread the best for that?
No answer tonight, I'll re-examine later in the day.

Hugh
