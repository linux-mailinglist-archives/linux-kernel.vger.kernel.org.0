Hey Steve,

Something like an analog to digitial coversion function where you lose the
granularity of the signal depending on how much trace data:
https://www.globalspec.com/ImageRepository/LearnMore/20142/9ee38d1a85d37fa23f86a14d3a9776ff67b0ec0f3b.gif

so like, if you had a counter incrementing with values after the increments
as:  1,3,4,8,12,14,30 and say 5 is the threshold at which to emit a trace,
then you would get 1,8,12,30.

So I guess what is need is a way to reduce the quantiy of trace data this
way. For this usecase, the user mostly cares about spikes in the counter
changing that accurate values of the different points.

thanks,

 - Joel
