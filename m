I took a look at how x86 deals with 5-level page table: it allows to handle
5-level and 4-level at runtime by folding the last page table level (cf
Documentation/x86/x86_64/5level-paging.rst). So we might want to be able to
do the same and deal with that at runtime.

Regarding my series about mmap, x86 does not care about the width of the
the address space and sets values of ARCH_MMAP_RND_BITS_MIN/MAX based
on 32bit or 64bit (but then does not respect the magic formula as in arm64).

And FYI my series and your patch are already in linux-next.

Thanks,

Alex
