I created a new environment as described by Adrian (thanks!), built a
5.5.0-rc2 kernel based on Debian config-5.3.0-3-m68k, and ran these
tests too:

So those all pass too. Maybe your kernel configuration is not suited
for these tests (in which case I would expect them to fail at compile
time by the way, the test should assert that).

That one fails the same way for me, but I don't think this is actually
a problem with the wiring up of the system call.
I tried debugging it, the child process exits at line 99 (the check
whether the SIGUSR1 signal handler is indeed cleared in the child):

94                      ret = sigaction(SIGUSR1, NULL, &act);
95                      if (ret < 0)
96                              exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
97
98                      if (act.sa_handler != SIG_DFL)
99                              exit(EXIT_FAILURE);          <--- failure point

Oh, I did have problems with gdb and the 'next' and 'nexti' commands,
they did not quite stop where I expected them too, they stopped
somewhere in libc assembly instead.
But that's probably unrelated.

Kind regards,

Kars.
