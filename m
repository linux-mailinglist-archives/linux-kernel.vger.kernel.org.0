For that case, the operations are inherently unordered with respect to
each other, and assuming the interpretation that waitpid is allowed to
wait on "the pgid at the time of the call" rather than at the time of
child exit/status-change -- which was discussed thoroughly in the
thread leading up to this patch -- there is no conformance
distinction.

On the other hand, with changing your own pgid from a signal handler,
there is a clear observable ordering between the events. For example,
if the signal handler changes the pgid and forks a child with the new
pgid, waitpid for "own pgid" can be assumed to include the new child
in its wait set.

I agree this is not common usage, so impact of breakage is probably
low, but I'd rather not have wrong/racy hacks be something we're
committed to supporting indefinitely on the userspace side.

It only affects RV32 anyway; other archs all have a waitpid syscall
that can be used. Since there's not yet any official libc release with
RV32 support and AIUI the ABI is not considered "frozen" yet,
emulation doesn't seem useful here. Whatever kernel version fixes this
(or some later one, if nobody gets things together on upstreaming libc
support of RV32) will just become the minimum version for RV32.
