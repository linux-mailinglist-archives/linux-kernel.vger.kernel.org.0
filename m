Thank you.  I agree.  There was some back-and-forth about the SoC move
w.r.t any new aspeed misc drivers. Whether moving them into SoC was a
good approach versus leaving the growing list in misc.  Another aspeed
driver, controlling UART was headed to misc and received push-back
that it was sufficiently specialized to go into SoC
(https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/969238/).  This feedback triggered
this staging move.

I think storing the growing misc drivers for these SoCs (Aspeed,
Nuvoton) in a SoC folder is a reasonable grouping.

Thank you, that makes perfect sense.  When moving the drivers, I was
only considering the case where one is compiling them for use and
forgot to check for COMPILE_TEST.
