Thanks for reviewing and bringing up the questions.  To be honest, my
concern was mainly related with AudoFDO but I don't aware other
potential issues.  So any concern is welcome, in case I miss anything;
hope we can get conclusion with some dicussion.  Please see more
detailed explanation in below.

Let's clarify for this.  Firstly, here the 'branch' doesn't refer to
'branch' sample, it means the last branch recording for instruction
samples.  So basically, neither instruction sample nor branch sample
will be changed with this patch.

This patch tries to fix the issue as below:

Before this patch:

  ffff800010083580 <el0_sync>:
  ffff800010083580:  stp     x0, x1, [sp]         -> synthesize instruction sample(n),
                                                     record the last branch,
                                                     reset the last branch.
  ffff800010083584:  stp     x2, x3, [sp,#16]
  ffff800010083588:  stp     x4, x5, [sp,#32]     -> synthesize instruction sample(n+1),
                                                     the last branch is empty which is
                                                     reset by the instructiom sample(n).
  ffff80001008358c:  stp     x6, x7, [sp,#48]
  ffff800010083590:  stp     x8, x9, [sp,#64]     -> synthesize instruction sample(n+2),
                                                     the last branch is empty which is
                                                     reset by the instructiom sample(n).
  [...]


After this patch:

  ffff800010083580 <el0_sync>:
  ffff800010083580:  stp     x0, x1, [sp]         -> synthesize instruction sample(n),
                                                     record the last branch.
  ffff800010083584:  stp     x2, x3, [sp,#16]
  ffff800010083588:  stp     x4, x5, [sp,#32]     -> synthesize instruction sample(n+1),
                                                     record the last branch.
  ffff80001008358c:  stp     x6, x7, [sp,#48]
  ffff800010083590:  stp     x8, x9, [sp,#64]     -> synthesize instruction sample(n+2),
                                                     record the last branch.
  [...]


So from my understanding, the last branch recording works as the
affiliate info for instruction samples and it allows us (or tools) to
know what's the execution flow for the instruction samples.  Seems to
me, it doesn't change value for instruction sample, but we can have
correct info of the last branch recording for every instruction samples.

Exactly.

@Adrian, it would be nice if you could confirm intel_pt should apply
the samiliar fixing or not?

Agree, if AutoFDO uses big period (e.g. --itrace=i10000), this patch
will not change anything.  With big period, it has enough packets to
generate branch recording between two instruction samples.

Could you elaborate what's 'other tools'?  If it's open sourced tool,
I can try to test with this patch set.

Thanks,
Leo Yan
