I don't understand why this wouldn't have a .fw_name or an .index >=3D 0,
or both. Is there some reason why that isn't happening?

Sure. It can be better documented. Sorry it's not super obvious. I added
this later in the series. We could have:

	#define CLK_SKIP_FW_LOOKUP .index =3D -1

and then this would read as:

        { .name =3D "g12a_ao_32k_by_oscin", CLK_SKIP_FW_LOOKUP },

Maybe? I'm open to suggestions.

I don't imagine we can get rid of legacy name for a long time, so this
can't be in this order. Otherwise we'll try to lookup the legacy name
before trying the DT lookup and suffer performance hits doing a big
global search while also skipping the DT lookup that we want drivers to
use if they're more modern.

>=20

So just assign -1 to .index? I still think my patch may be needed if
somehow the index is assigned to something less than 0 and the .fw_name
is specified. I guess that's possible if the struct is on the stack, so
we'll probably have to allow this combination.
