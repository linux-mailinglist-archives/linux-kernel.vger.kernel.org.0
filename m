when a firmware bug appears, the potential problem may beyond the scope 
of its visible impacts so that introducing a workaround in official 
implementation should be considered very carefully.

If the workaround is really needed at this point, I would recommend 
adding a WARN_TAINT with TAINT_FIRMWARE_WORKAROUND, to tell the 
workaround is in the place.
