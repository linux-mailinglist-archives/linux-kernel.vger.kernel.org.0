With my TLB-handling-writing-and-reviewing code on, NAK to any VM games
here.

Honestly, I almost think we should unconditionally copy the whole 8K for
the case where the ioperm() syscall has been used (i.e. not emulating
iopl()).  The benefit simply does not justify the risk of getting it
wrong.  I'm okay, but barely, with optimizing the end of the copied
range.  Optimizing the start of the copied range is pushing it.  Playing
MMU tricks and getting all the per-task-ioperm and invalidation right is
way beyond reasonable.

Even the time spent discussing how to optimize a case that has literally
one known user that none of us can bring ourselves to care about much
seems wasteful.
