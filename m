SD/MMC does not need slave DMA, it is self containing with it's own
built-in DMA.
I'm not sure if it is enabled in defconfig. It is not enabled at all in
defconfig atm.

Normally I would use nfs rootfs, but we don't have network drivers
upstream for K3 platform.

I think having the UDMA stack as module should be fine when I have the
dependencies in to be able to build them as modules.

Sure, I fully agree on this, we should have non boot needed drivers as
modules.

Well, it depends how you look at it ;)

UDMA stack is not enabled in defconfig (w/o this patch):
$ size vmlinux
text      data     bss     dec       hex      filename
17853717  9221872  469288  27544877  1a44d2d  vmlinux

UDMA stack is enabled in defconfig (w this patch):
$ size vmlinux
text      data     bss     dec       hex      filename
17890970  9237544  469288  27597802  1a51bea  vmlinux

It would be nice for other driver to enable the DMA if it is acceptable
to have it built in for start and when I can build it as module we can
switch it to module?
