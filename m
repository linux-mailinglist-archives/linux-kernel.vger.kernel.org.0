I quickly tried hackbench on SiFive Unleashed board with latest Linus
tree master branch (having your patch) and I am seeing 12% slowdown.

I am sure if I try more heavier benchmarks (such as stress-ng) then
the slowdown will be even more.

Here are the detailed numbers:

Command: ./hackbench 32
Number of Tasks: 32*40 (== 1280)
Average Time (without debug options): 3.10525
Average Time (with debug options): 3.471 (11.78% slower)

Command: ./hackbench 64
Number of Tasks: 64*40 (== 2560)
Average Time (without debug options): 6.3015
Average Time (with debug options): 7.05875 (12.017% slower)

Command: ./hackbench 128
Number of Tasks: 128*40 (== 5120)
Average Time (without debug options): 12.6275
Average Time (with debug options): 14.1455 (12.0214% slower)

It is this performance impact due to which other architectures (such as
x86 and ARM64) don't have these debug options enabled in their defconfigs.

I will send a patch to move these debug options to separate debug
defconfigs so that people have a way to build a debug kernel.

Anup
