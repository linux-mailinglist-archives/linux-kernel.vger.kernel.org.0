AFAIU your suggestion is pretty similar to the option 2), but it concerns
the fixup implementation. So instead of subscribing to the reference clock
change event and directly adjusting the UART clock divider when the change
happens, you suggest to convert the divisor setting code into a clock
provider, which in case of the parental clocks rate change shall
automatically cause the rate adjustment of the clocks hierarchy below.

While your proposal looks neat and better suits a common approach of
the drivers design, it won't be that easy to be implemented for the serial
subsystem. As far as I can see serial and 8250 code is too coupled with
manual divisor and reference clock settings. Common 8250 port code gets
and sets the divisor and relies on the reference clock value. Similarly
the 8250-compatible vendor specific devices may also have custom divisor
settings. Moreover uartclk field, which indicates the reference clock rate
value, is used in many placed over the serial code, so if we implemented
your design we would have to update it value anyway, which means to
subscribe to the reference clock rate change event.

So in order to do what you said, the serial subsystem would have to be
seriously refactored, which taking into account the subsystem age and
number of driver, will be very painful.
