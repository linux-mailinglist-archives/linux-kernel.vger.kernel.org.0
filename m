Lets tighten the seat belts :-).. I'm with you that late-loading has
shown weakness more recently than earlier. There are several obvious reasons
that you are well aware. But there is a lot that *must* be done to make sure
the guard rails are tight enough for deplopying late-load. 100% agree on that
to make sure the interface and mechanism needs to be improved for robustness
but not a candidate for removal. Certainly this is an argument that would help
me drive towards that objective internally.

When we did the late-load changes last year we added a warning if any
of the cpuid bits either dissappear or new ones appear. Maybe we should
have tainted the kernel to track that so its not that subtle anymore.
