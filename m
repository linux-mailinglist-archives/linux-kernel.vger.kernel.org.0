Yes, changing NR_ANON_THPS semantic sounds like a bad idea. Let
me try whether I understand the problem. So we have some THP in
limbo waiting for them to be split and unmapped parts to be freed,
right? I can see that page_remove_anon_compound_rmap does correctly
decrement NR_ANON_MAPPED for sub pages that are no longer mapped by
anybody. LRU pages seem to be accounted properly as well.  As you've
said NR_ANON_THPS reflects the number of THPs mapped and that should be
reflecting the reality already IIUC.

So the only problem seems to be that deferred THP might aggregate a lot
of immediately freeable memory (if none of the subpages are mapped) and
that can confuse MemAvailable because it doesn't know about the fact.
Has an skewed counter resulted in a user observable behavior/failures?
I can see that memcg rss size was the primary problem David was looking
at. But MemAvailable will not help with that, right? Moreover is
accounting the full THP correct? What if subpages are still mapped?
