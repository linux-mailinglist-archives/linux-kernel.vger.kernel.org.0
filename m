Temporary braino. We definitely cannot remove that check.

Yeah, I was considering this too, but Linus' approach seemed simpler.

Yeah, this is simpler for me to prove to myself that it's correct, and I
like that it touches less code, tbh. I'll give it a try here in a bit
and see if it also fixes up the perf regression.

FWIW, here's the variant of Linus' patch I've been testing. It seems to
fix the performance regression too.

--------------8<---------------

[PATCH] locks: reinstate locks_delete_lock optimization

There is measurable performance impact in some synthetic tests in commit
6d390e4b5d48 (locks: fix a potential use-after-free problem when wakeup
a waiter).  Fix the race condition instead by clearing the fl_blocker
pointer after the wakeup and by using smp_load_acquire and
smp_store_release to handle the access.

This means that we can no longer use the clearing of fl_blocker clearing
as the wait condition, so switch over to checking whether the
fl_blocked_member list is empty.

[ jlayton: wait on the fl_blocked_requests list to go empty instead of
	   the fl_blocker pointer to clear. ]
