So the worst case when it becomes redundant might not affect the performance much ?

Right.

Agreed.

Detected this during a code audit. I figured it can help save some cycles. The other
call site start_isolate_page_range() does not check migrate type because the page
block is guaranteed to be MIGRATE_ISOLATE ? I am not sure if a non-lock check first
in this case is actually improving performance. In which case should we just leave
the check as is ?
