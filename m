The implementation looks fine to me.

I am more interested in this part. As I am aware the only 2 other
transport being discussed is SMC/HVC and new/yet conceptual SPCI(built
on top of SMC/HVC). There are already discussions on the list to make
former as mailbox[1]. While I see both pros and cons with that approach,
there's a need to converge. One main advantage I see with SMC/HVC mailbox
is that it can be used with any other client and not just SCMI. Equally,
the queuing in the mailbox may not be needed with fast SMC/HVC but may
be needed for new SPCI(not yet fully analysed).

As I mentioned I am fine with implementation in this patch. But I would
like to hear especially from Arnd and Jassi as the abstraction look more
like mailbox APIs themselves and may look like duplication. I don't
want people to realise late that this is not good idea for whatever
reasons. If we have valid and enough reasons to do so, we can take
this approach. I really need some feedback here.
