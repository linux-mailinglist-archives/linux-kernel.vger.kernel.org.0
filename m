Will do in v2.

Yes I saw this, and I considered doing something similar. But, those
defines are in uapi/linux/prctl.h, which does not include any asm/*.h
header. This would have then required adding a full infrastructure for
asm/prctl.h (that could then include sve_context.h for example), which
does not exist yet, instead of copying these two values.

Since this is part of the kernel-userspace ABI, I don't see this values
changing anytime soon, which is why I thought copying them shouldn't be
a big issue.

A simple solution would be to to include sve_context.h or a third
header, maybe linux/prctl_arm64_sve.h (with only these two/five
defines), in linux/prctl.h, and reuse it in uapi/asm/ptrace.h; but this
would break the self-contained nature of linux/prctl.h.

This one is much simpler and closer to what I had in mind with this
patch.

Will, what do you think of this second approach Dave proposed ?
