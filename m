	unlock_page

I guess lock range is as above, so the race can happen, however,
1) If mkwrite() creates data in hole, direct_IO->f2fs_map_blocks should
return NEW_ADDR, which means that is a hole of file, so direct_IO should
read all zeroed data.
2) If mkwrite() overwrite data in block, mkwrite->f2fs_get_blocks won't
change old block address, then direct_IO->f2fs_map_blocks could get that
block address, and won't read stale data.

But I doubt could we read stale data with below race condition:

kworker					DIO reader
- writepages
					- f2fs_map_blocks
					 - get old block address
 - writepage
  trigger OPU, update old block address to new one

someone trigger checkpoint, data in old block address becomes stale,
then anyone else can write data into there.
					 - submit_bio
					  get stale data

Or am I missing something that maybe vfs has did such synchronization.

Thanks,
