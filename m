That depends on the bus specific implementation of add_links()? Not
sure I can explain how a future implementation can get it wrong?

Yes, as in, thinking it's a dependency when it's not.

Correct. One example is the clock controller cyclic dependency that
was mentioned in the v1 patch series [1]. Search for "cyclic" if you
want to read that part. Can happen between interconnect providers too
for example. But I explain it below in the commit text as Device-C and
Device-S. Both of those could be different clock providers.

Device-S gets linked. Not remains linked.

Not correct. Device-S will not be probed because it has a device link
to Device-C.

Correct.

No, module loading. I was using a loadable driver as an example. The
same thing could happen if the driver is registered at a later init
call level too.

It's not probed.

See other reply. I think you mixed up a node in a list with a list.
The name is very correct and is not misleading.

It does.

really_probe() doesn't set device->drv for a good reason. Because the
driver could be unregistered/unloaded at anytime before the device and
driver are bound to each other.

Looks like a significant chunk of this question ties into the
assumption that needs_suppliers vs wait_for_suppliers are two
different lists. Since I'm clarifying that's not the case, I'll wait
to see if you still have any questions and if so wait for your to
rewrite this.

In the example above, it just needs to delete the Device-S is a
consumer of Device-C link and then add a Device-C is a consumer of
Device-S link.

I can send an example code in a subsequent reply.

Already addressed that in a separate patch.
