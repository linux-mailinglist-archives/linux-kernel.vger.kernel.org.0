What if those pages contain self-modifying code but the host doesn't know ahead of time? Would it require ALLOW_WRITE|ALLOW_EXEC at EADD? Then would it prevent those pages to start with PROT_EXEC?

Anyway, my point is that it is unnecessary even if it works.

What I was talking about was EMODPE[PROT_WRITE] on an RX page.

Architecturally we shouldn't dictate how LSM makes decisions. ALLOW_* are no difference than PROCESS__* or FILE__* flags, which are just artifacts to assist particular LSMs in decision making. They are never considered part of the LSM interface, even if other LSMs than SELinux may adopt the same/similar approach.

If code duplication is what you are worrying about, you can put them in a library, or implement/export them in some new file (maybe security/enclave.c?) as utility functions. But spilling them into user mode is what I think is unacceptable.

Each open("/dev/sgx/enclave") syscall creates a *new* instance of struct file to uniquely identify one enclave instance. What I mean is @vma->vm_file, not @vma->vm_file->f_path or @vma->vm_file->f_inode.

vma->vm_file identifies an enclave instance uniquely. FILE__EXECUTE is checked by security_enclave_load() using @source_vma->vm_file. Once a page has been EADD'ed, whether to allow RW->RX depends on .sigstruct file (more precisely, the file backing SIGSTRUCT), whose FILE__* attributes could be cached in vma->vm_file->f_security by security_enclave_init().
 
The noexec case should be addressed in IOC_ADD_PAGES by testing @source_vma->vm_flags & VM_MAYEXEC.
