Hi Mark,

Thank you for your comments.

I understand, however, I understood that 
ARM64_CPUCAP_OPTIONAL_FOR_LATE_CPU did not allow later CPU to be 
heterogeneous if the capability wasn't already enabled. Thus if as you 
say we need to allow the system to switch from homogeneous to 
heterogeneous, then I should change the type of this capability.

That is a good point indeed.
