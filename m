Which is in some cases simply impossible. Think multiqueue devices with
managed interrupts. You can't change the affinity of those. Neither can
you do that for the per cpu timer interrupt.

No. It's the same HT so not similar at all.

OTOH, thats mostly correct. Aside of the shouldn't wording:

  MDS _is_ no issue in this case when the full mitigation is enabled.

Assumed that I have not less information about MDS than you have :)

How so?

Host memory is attackable, when one of the sibling SMT threads runs in
host OS (hypervisor) context and the other in guest context.

HT1 is in guest mode and attacking (has control over PTEs). HT2 is
running in host mode and executes an interrupt handler. The host PTE
inversion does not matter in this scenario at all.

So HT1 can very well see data which is brought into the shared L1 by
HT2.

The only way to mitigate that aside of disabling HT is disabling EPT.

If the victim HT is kicked out of execution with an IPI then the overlap
depends on the contexts:

        HT1 (attack)		HT2 (victim)

 A      idle -> user space      user space -> idle

 B      idle -> user space      guest -> idle

 C      idle -> guest           user space -> idle

 D      idle -> guest           guest -> idle

The IPI from HT1 brings HT2 immediately into the kernel when HT2 is in
host user mode or brings it immediately into VMEXIT when HT2 is in guest
mode.

#A On return from handling the IPI HT2 immediately reschedules to idle.
   To have an overlap the return to user space on HT1 must be faster.

#B Coming back from VEMXIT into schedule/idle might take slightly longer
   than #A.

#C Similar to #A, but reentering guest mode in HT1 after sending the IPI
   will probably take longer.

#D Similar to #C if you make the assumption that VMEXIT on HT2 and
   rescheduling into idle is not significantly slower than reaching
   VMENTER after sending the IPI.

In all cases the data exposed by a potential overlap shouldn't be that
interesting (e.g. scheduler state), but that obviously depends on what
the attacker is looking for.

But all of them are still problematic vs. interrupts / softinterrupts
which can happen on HT2 on the way to idle or while idling. i.e. #3 of
the original case list. #A and #B are only affected my MDS, #C and #D by
both MDS and L1TF (if EPT is in use).

#1 can be partially mitigated by changing interrupt affinities, which is
   not always possible and in the case of the local timer interrupt
   completely impossible. It's not only the timer interrupt itself, the
   timer callbacks which can run in the softirq on return from interrupt
   might be valuable attack surface depending on the nature of the
   callbacks, the random entropy timer just being a random example.

#2 is a non issue if MDS mitigation is on, i.e. buffers are flushed
   before returning to user space. It's pretty much a non SMT case,
   i.e. same CPU user to kernel attack.

#3 Can only be fully mitigated by disabling EPT 

#4 Assumed that my assumptions about transition times are correct, which
   I think they are, #4 is pretty much redirected to #1

Hope that helps.

Thanks,

        tglx
