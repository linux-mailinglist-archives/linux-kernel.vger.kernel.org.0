Yes, this patch would make THPs get split earlier.

For example, I have a test case which generates around 4G deferred split 
THPs (2K huge pages). With the default seeks, THPs would start to get 
split when priority reaches 6 since nr_to_scan depends on priority and 
shrinker->seeks. With this patch it would start to get split at the very 
beginning (priority 12).

IMHO, somehow this would achieve the similar effect with pro-actively 
draining.

Maybe, but it is not clear to me that other approaches would be 
universally better than the current one unless we could split the page 
right away.
