So this opens up bit of LRU management to user space hints. Also because the app
in itself wont know about the memory situation of the entire system, new system
call needs to be called from an external process.

IIUC the swap-in ratio is way higher in comparison to that of swap out. Is that
always the case ? Or it tend to swap out from an active area of the working set
which faulted back again.

That is assuming that post process_madvise() working set for the application is
always smaller. There is another challenge. The external process should ideally
have the knowledge of active areas of the working set for an application in
question for it to invoke process_madvise() correctly to prevent such scenarios.

That would be the worst case scenario which should be avoided. Memory pressure
must be a parameter before actually doing the swap out. But pages if know to be
inactive/cold can be marked high priority to be swapped out.

Is there any other real world scenario apart from this app based ecosystem where
user hinted LRU management might be helpful ? Just being curious. Thanks for the
detailed explanation. I will continue looking into this series.
