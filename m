But that system memory option is on by default, right? In any case, a 
request for a huge_fault
would probably need to check that there is actually an underlying 
huge_page and otherwise fallback to ordinary faults.

Another requirement would be for IO memory allocations to be 
PMD_PAGE_SIZE aligned in the mappable aperture, to avoid fallbacks to 
ordinary faults. Probably increasing fragmentation somewhat. (Seems like 
pmd entries can only point to PMD_PAGE_SIZE aligned physical addresses) 
Would that work for you?

An interesting idea, although we'd lose things like dirty-tracking bits.
