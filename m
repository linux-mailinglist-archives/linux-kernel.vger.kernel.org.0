Got it!

The main reason is that we are developing the test suite and we noticed
the miss match. Since we want to make sure that applications behave in
the same way on different transports, we thought we would solve it that
way.

But what you are saying (also in the reply of the patches) is actually
quite right. Not being publicized, applications do not expect this behavior,
so please discard this series.

My problem during the tests, was trying to figure out if half-closed
sockets were supported or not, so as you say adding an IOCTL or maybe
better a getsockopt() could solve the problem.

What do you think?

Thanks,
Stefano
