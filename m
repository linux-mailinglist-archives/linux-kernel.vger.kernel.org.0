kobject_add() and kobject_init() I suppose?

So actually, if you look at kobject_cleanup(), it calls kobject_del()
if kobj->state_in_sysfs is set.

Now, if you look at kobject_add_internal(), it sets
kobj->state_in_sysfs when about to return 0 (success).

Therefore calling kobject_put() without the preceding kobject_del() is
not a bug technically, even though it will trigger the "auto cleanup
kobject_del" message with debug enabled.

The plan sounds good to me, but there is one thing to note IMO:
kobject_cleanup() invokes the ->release() callback for the ktype, so
these callbacks need to be able to cope with kobjects after a failing
kobject_add() which may not be entirely obvious to developers
introducing them ATM.
