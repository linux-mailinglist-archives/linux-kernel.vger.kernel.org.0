No, the HW default is 0x2. Also, we are repurposing the LP filter for 
applying gain.

Yes, hw_params is where it is taken from. The additional override is 
optional and would not usually need to be set by user. However, we have 
certain other modules, like multiplexer and demultiplexer (proposed to 
be upstreamed in the near future), where no. of channels get changed at 
the output. When one or more such modules are connected in the path, 
hw_params does not reflect the channels post multiplex/demultiplex, 
hence this override would be needed.

No, these are not board wiring. OSR, polarity, etc. are configurable 
within the DMIC (within Tegra). Of course, these controls are optional 
and the default works just fine. Also, to clarify here, 'runtime 
selectable' does not mean these parameters can be modified while a 
recording session is in progress. These parameters (optional) need to 
set up before a session is started. User can close the recording, 
reconfigure the parameters, then start a new session, without needing 
reboot.

It is not necessary for an actual mic to be connected to the pin. 
Recording will work even when the pin is left open, capture being 
silence. All the drivers, whether for playback or for capture, work OK 
even without any physical end-point, hence the "dummy" I/O.

These are finer controls and I would guess are outside what can be 
described by DAPM. E.g. - say the user wants mono capture, but the board 
has stereo mics connected. Default configuration is that the Left 
channel would be propagated. The stereo_to_mono option offers additional 
control - to select the Right channel, or mix L and R into one. As 
mentioned earlier, much of the controls here are not necessary to be set 
for a basic use case to work. These are advanced settings.
