I'm still working on how the irq was triggered,
it is a little complex to reproduce it, first it must run with NFS rootfs,
without NFS rootfs it can not reproduced.
Then with kdump enabled, after "echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger" crash the kernel,
the kernel specified by kdump will boot, then interrupt will trigger
soon after azx interrupt was register.

Got it, Thanks.
