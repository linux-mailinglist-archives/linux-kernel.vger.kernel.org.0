Yes, this is indeed prossible. On the other hand even the reclaim from
the charge path doesn't really prevent from that happening because the
context might get preempted or blocked on locks. So I guess we need a
more detailed information of an actual world visible problem here.

I am not aware of that. The primary problem back then was that we simply
cannot have a kernel thread per each memcg because that doesn't scale.
Using kthreads and a dynamic pool of threads tends to be quite tricky -
e.g. a proper accounting, scaling again.

I am not against pushing high memory reclaim into the charge path in
principle. I just want to hear how big of a problem this really is in
practice. If this is mostly a theoretical problem that might hit then I
would rather stick with the existing code though.
