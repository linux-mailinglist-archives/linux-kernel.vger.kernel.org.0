I don't have complete understanding of the requirements yet, but we may
have to make scmi_shared_mem transport specific vaguely based on virtio
requirements. I must have more info once I have discussion with them
soon. I will reply to this thread after that. More likely by end of this
week. Thanks for your patience, we are still trying to make sure we
have gathered all the requirements.

Though it may be part of same block of memory on most of the platforms,
it is not mandatory. It can be scattered. VirtIO based transport might
have something like that.
