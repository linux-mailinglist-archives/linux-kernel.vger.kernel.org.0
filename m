Okay, thanks! I can try a rough estimate under emulation, but I assume
that'll be mostly useless. :)

Gotcha. I was already surprised by how "heavy" the per-cpu access was
when I looked at the resulting assembly (there looked to be preempt
stuff, etc). But my hope was that this is configurable so people can
measure for themselves if they want it, and most people who want this
feature have a high tolerance for performance trade-offs. ;)

Okay, cool; thanks for the details! It's always nice to confirm I didn't
miss some glaringly obvious solution. ;)

For a potential v2, should I add your reviewed-by or wait for your
timing analysis, etc?
