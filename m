Dear Sir/Madam,



Its really nice contacting you and hope to have a good business
relationship.

I have urgent Investment proposal from Algeria, as i was 
informed, and i
think you might be interested.

I was in contact with a high profile past Government Official in 
Algeria,
who i happen to legally represent as personal attorney. He 
informed me that
he has some huge funds he wish to invest abroad which amounts to 
$174
millions of dollars. He has managed to acquire this fund during 
his time of
service in the government.

We need help of foreign company or person to help transfer the 
funds abroad
for investment after which the funds will be shared by 
percentage.

Please inform if you can pose as beneficiary of this funds so 
that we can go
into more details.

Also be informed that we can show proof of funds.

As a matter of fact, we can show our ONLINE BANK LOGIN, proving 
the
availability of funds, but this depends on if we can trust you 
with funds.

I hope to get feedback from you soon.

You can reply to my email:
