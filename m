Hi Elliot,

To be honest, I'm still confused by this series, and I think that these
patches indicate a larger problem that we cannot solve generally (e.g.
on other platofrms and/or with ACPI).

I think the underlying issue is whether the semantics for:

a) Linux's RESET_WARM and RESET_SOFT
b) PSCI's SYSTEM_RESET2 SYSTEM_WARM_RESET

... actually align in practice, which this series suggests is not the
case.

If those don't align, then I think that commit:

  4302e381a870aafb ("firmware/psci: add support for SYSTEM_RESET2")

... is not actually reliable, and not something we can support by
default, and we should rethink the code introduce in that commit.

If (a) and (b) are supposed to align, and the behaviour on your platform
is an erratum, then I think we should treat it as such rather than
adding a property that is open to abuse.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Mark.
