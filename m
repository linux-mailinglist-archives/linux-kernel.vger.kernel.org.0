That might simply be assuming that the bus power also controls the card power.

The response seems to show the card in state 9 bus-testing, which would
suggest the use of CMD19 for eMMC.  Perhaps the wrong command is used for
eMMC re-tuning?

The difficulty with changing long standing flow is that it might reveal
problems for other existing hardware.  Did you consider making a
driver-specific change?  The ->reset() callback could be used.
