See my response to the broken out patch as to where it should have
complained.

No problem, it's much appreciated.

I would only go off of the spec, who knows where exfat-fuse got its
information from :)

If it really is CreateUtcOffset, we should use that.

For things like messing with fields, testing on another operating system
to ensure we got this right is going to be very essential.  Virtual
machines of osx or windows might be a good way to do that.
