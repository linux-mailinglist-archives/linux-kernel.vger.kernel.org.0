Linus, Kirill

I've pushed a reworked version based on the pagewalk code here:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~thomash/linux/log/?h=pagewalk

(top three patched)

with users included here:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~thomash/linux/log/?h=coherent-rebased

Do you think this could work? The reason that the "mm: Add write-protect 
and clean.." code is still in mm as a set of helpers, is of course that 
much of the needed functionality is not exported, presumably since we 
want to keep page table manipulation in mm.

Thanks,

Thomas
