Hi,

Me and Mat are working on this together, and I had a followup to
something Mat asked earlier.

Any guidance here on this?

Essentially I think we are looking for a way to
1) expose the "capability" of having a privacy screen feature from
kernel to userland, and
2) then a way to "control" (enable / disable) the feature from
userland to kernel. I understand DRM connector property is the
suggested way to do this.

But I was not clear if DRM connector properties a recommended way to
do (1) also. If yes, then Mat's posted a proposal
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/3/2068) but I did not see any comment
specifically if that idea looked reasonable. Also looking for any
guidance to Mat's question above.

Thanks,

Rajat
