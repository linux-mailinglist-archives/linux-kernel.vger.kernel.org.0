Make life easier when syscon consumer want to access multiple syscon
nodes with dozens of items.
Add syscon-names and relative properties to help to manage different
cases when accessing more than one syscon node even with arguments.

+==Syscon Name==
+
+Syscon name is a helper to be used in consumer nodes who refer to system
+controller node. It provides a way to refer to syscon node by names with
+phandle args in syscon consumer node. It will help people who have a lot
+of syscon references to be managed. It is not a must feature and has no
+effect to syscon node itself at all.
+
+Required properties:
+- syscons: List of phandles and any number of arguments if needed. Arguments
+  is specific to differnet vendors and its usage should be described at each
+  vendor's bindings. For example: In Unisoc SoCs, the 1st arg will be treated
+  as register address offset and the 2nd is bit mask.
+
+- syscon-names:        List of syscon node name strings sorted in the same order as
+  what it represents in property syscons.
+
+Optional property:
+- #.*-cells: Represents the number of arguments in single phandle in syscons
+  list. ".*" is vendor specific. If this property is not set, default value
+  will be 0.
+
+Examples:
+
+apb_regs: syscon@20008000 {
+       compatible = "sprd,apb-glb", "syscon";
+       reg = <0x20008000 0x100>;
