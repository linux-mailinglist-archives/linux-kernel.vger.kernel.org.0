in flight means that the interrupt chip (in the offending case the IO-APIC)
has that interrupt raised internally _AND_ already propagated to the
destination CPU (in this case the local APIC of the destination). The CPU
has accepted the interrupt and now the chip is in a state where it waits
for it to be acknowledged. If we proceed in that state then the destination
CPU will eventually handle it _after_ all the resources are freed. But that
means that the in flight/wait for acknowledge state becomes stale because
the handling CPU does not find the connection to that chip anymore.

Ah, indeed that could be mapped to it.

I'm happy to get rid of the extra callback. Now the question is whether
this would would give an headache for any of the chips which already
implement that callback and whether it needs to become conditional on the
trigger type at the core level. For the IO-APIC this state is only defined
for level type which makes sense as edge is fire and forget.

Thanks,
