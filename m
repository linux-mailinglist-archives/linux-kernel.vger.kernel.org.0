Umm.  OK.  Well, something that used to work is now broken.  So how
should we fix it?  Take a look at shrink_node() in mm/vmscan.c.  If we've
submitted a lot of writes to a device, and overloaded it, we want to
sleep until it's able to take more writes:

                /*
                 * Stall direct reclaim for IO completions if underlying BDIs
                 * and node is congested. Allow kswapd to continue until it
                 * starts encountering unqueued dirty pages or cycling through
                 * the LRU too quickly.
                 */
                if (!sc->hibernation_mode && !current_is_kswapd() &&
                   current_may_throttle() && pgdat_memcg_congested(pgdat, root))
                        wait_iff_congested(BLK_RW_ASYNC, HZ/10);

With a standard block device, that now sleeps until the timeout (100ms)
expires, which is far too long for a modern SSD but is probably tuned
just right for some legacy piece of spinning rust (or indeed a modern
USB stick).  How would the block layer like to indicate to the mm layer
"I am too busy, please let the device work for a bit"?
