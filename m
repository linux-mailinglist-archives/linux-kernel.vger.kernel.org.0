So which side is in control here, the "bus" or the "client"?  For the
bus to care, it's a bytestream and should be represented as such (like
you have) with a number of bytes in the "packet".

If you already know the structure types, just make a union of all of the
valid ones and be done with it.  In other words, try to avoid using void
* as much as is ever possible please.
