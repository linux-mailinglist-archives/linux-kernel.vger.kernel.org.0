While this might be the case we should _not_ break any guests
running now. So this kind of reasoning is dangerous.

The only risk that I can see is that some frontend/backend pair needed a direct 4 -> 6 transition to support 'unbind' before but AFAIK nothing has ever supported that, and blk and net crash'n'burn if you try that on upstream as it stands. A clean unplug would always set state to 5 first, since that's part of the unplug protocol.

That was my question: are you sure all current and previous
guest frontends and backends are handling unplug this way?

Not "should handle", but "do handle".
