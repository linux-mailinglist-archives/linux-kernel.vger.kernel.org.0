I remember we had this discussion in the past and was trying to dig up
the archive. I found it [1]. At that time and even today, I don't have
knowledge of any upstream platform using memory other than SRAM and
hence I found it safe to retain ioremap as is.

But I agree in general, this abstraction will allow us to add shmem of
other memory types like RAM. However, it's difficult to have understanding
and representation of the memory type used by the platform firmware say
in DT or even ACPI.
