This makes no sense to me what so ever. What actual instructions are
patched with _nosync() ? ftrace/jump_label only use 'NOP/JMP/CALL'

For NOP you can advance regs->ip, for JMP you can adjust regs->ip, for
CALL you adjust regs->ip and regs->r14 (IIUC you do something like:
regs->r14 = regs->ip+4; regs->ip = func;)

(FWIW emulating CALL on x86 is fun because we get to PUSH something on
the stack, let me know if you want to see the patches that were required
to make that happen :-)

On x86 all actual text poking is serialized by text_mutex.

That's a misunderstanding, the text_poke event is a side-band event and
as such delivered to all events that expressed interest in it. You don't
need any exception to event mapping yourself.

Thanks!
