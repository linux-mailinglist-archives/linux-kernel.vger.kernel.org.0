Right. But services might use those knobs, right? And that means that if
somebody wants a memory protection then the service file is going to use 
MemoryLow=$FOO and that is likely not going to work properly without an
an additional hassles, e.g. propagate upwards, which systemd doesn't do
unless I am mistaken.

I meant to say that once the unified hierarchy is used by systemd you
cannot configure it differently to suit your needs without interfering
with systemd.

I am not sure I see how that is going to change much wrt. resource
distribution TBH. Is the existing cgroup hierarchy going to change for
the OOMD to be deployed?

Let me ask more specifically. Is there any plan or existing API to allow
to configure which services are related resource wise?

I believe I have already expressed the configurability concern elsewhere
in the email thread. It boils down to necessity to propagate
protection all the way up the hierarchy properly if you really need to
protect leaf cgroups that are organized without a resource control in
mind. Which is what systemd does.
