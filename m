On the tinker-board pwm2 is unused and has a status=disabled in the
devicetree [at least when checking my current branches], so the kernel
shouldn't even create a plaform-device for it.

I.e. see [0] - the of_device_is_available() call should already drop the
disabled devices, so there should not even exist a ff680020.pwm .

So I guess the solution would be to find out why it creates ff680020.pwm
in the first place and fix that.
