Absolutely, I am all for helping those usecases. First of all we need to
understand what those usecases are though. So far we have only seen very
vague claims about artificial worst case examples when a remote access
dominates the overall cost but that doesn't seem to be the case in real
life in my experience (e.g. numa balancing will correct things or the
over aggressive node reclaim tends to cause problems elsewhere etc.).

That being said I am pretty sure that a new memory policy as proposed
previously that would allow for a node reclaim behavior is a way for
those very specific workloads that absolutely benefit from a local
access. There are however real life usecases that benefit from THP even
on remote nodes as explained by Andrea (most notable kvm) and the only
way those can express their needs is the madvise flag. Not to mention
that the default node reclaim behavior might cause excessive reclaim
as demonstrate by Mel and Anrea and that is certainly not desirable in
itself.

Andrea has outline the strategy to go IIRC. There also has been a
general agreement that we shouldn't be over eager to fall back to remote
nodes if the base page size allocation could be satisfied from a local node.
