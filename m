You lost me on this one.  Doesn't changing from 0444 to 0644 make it be
a runtime tunable?

These would be the tunables controlling how quickly RCU takes its
various actions to encourage the current grace period to end quickly.
I would be happy to give you the exact list if you wish, but most of
them have appeared in this thread.

The experiments should be designed to work out whether the current
default settings have configurations where they act badly.  This might
also come up with advice for people attempting hand-tuning, or proposed
parameter-checking code to avoid bad combinations.

For one example, setting the RCU CPU stall timeout too low will definitely
cause some unwanted splats.  (Yes, one could argue that other things in
the kernel should change to allow this value to decrease, but things
like latency tracer and friends are probably more useful and important.)
