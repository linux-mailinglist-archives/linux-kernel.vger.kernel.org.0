That does not sound like a standard sysfs interface.

Anyway, I don't think that works for every case, quoting from 
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/10/16/465:

"> Note: I do acknowledge that an overall issue is that we assume all 
PMCG IMP DEF events are same for a given SMMU model.

That assumption does technically fail already - I know MMU-600 has
different IMP-DEF events for its TCU and TBUs, however as long as we can
get as far as "this is some part of an MMU-600" the driver should be
able to figure out the rest ..."

So even if it is solvable here, the kernel driver(s) will need to be 
reworked. And that is just solving one case in many.

I'm nervous about coming up with a global "SYSID"
> when we don't have the ability to standardise anything in that space.

I understand totally, especially if any sysid is based on DT bindings.

But this is some sort of standardization:
