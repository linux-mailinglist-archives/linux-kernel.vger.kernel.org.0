Have also tried this on a EPYC 7302. Before the patch:

   k10temp-pci-00c3
   Adapter: PCI adapter
   Tdie:         +28.1°C  (high = +70.0°C)
   Tctl:         +28.1°C 

and after:

   k10temp-pci-00c3
   Adapter: PCI adapter
   Tdie:         +28.2°C  
   Tctl:         +28.2°C

No extra values shown, but I think this is expected.
