Again, the "issue" I see here is that we could now pass in numbers that 
are not a power of two. For gigantic pages it was clear that we always 
have a number of two. The alignment does not make any sense otherwise.

What I'm asking for is

a) Document "The resulting PFN is aligned to nr_pages" and "nr_pages 
should be a power of two".

b) Eventually adding something like

if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!is_power_of_2(nr_pages)))
	return NULL;

Once we need other granularities we can think about the alignment and an 
optimized search-process.
