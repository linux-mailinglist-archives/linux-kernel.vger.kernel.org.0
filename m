OF is not related to architecture. Driver depends on OF.
In the past, many build/linker issues were reported due to OF
& HAS_IOMEM dependencies in the code. Please see [1] & [2]. So
to be safe this time, i am adding these dependencies here.

Yes, this is a totally new IP for x86 based SoC. No plans
of using same IP/driver for any other arch based SoCs.
