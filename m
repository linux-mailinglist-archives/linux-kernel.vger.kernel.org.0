Thanks! I've folded that in and pushed out the updated branch.

Since the only change this time around was only a trivial change in the linker
script, I'll hold off sending a v3. I'm hoping I can get acks for the ftrace,
module, and parisc bits soon...

Yup, that sounds about right. The other thing I did was expand the comments on
the ABI details, as that can be quite subtle, but I guess that's arguably
cosmetic, too.

Thanks for working on this, and for bearing with me on this rework -- I hadn't
intended that to drag on for so long.

Thanks,
Mark.
