No, the test case is from Syzkaller, you can get it from [1]

commit dc9edc44de6c pushing the final release of request_queue to a
workqueue because sleepers are not allowed. However, since since
commit db6d99523560, sleeper is ok because blk_exit_rl() is removed
form blkg_free().

The reason of the problem is because the final release of request_queue
may be called after loop_remove() returns.
And I think it will be fixed if we revert commit db6d99523560.
