Yes, there is a problem.  This approach is incorrect, as I've tried to
explain a couple times already. Let me try to re-summarize why this
approach is incorrect.

Both fw_name and name should be provided when it is possible that
the DT does not describe the input clock. IOW, it is only for controllers
which relied on the global name so far and are now starting to describe
the clock input in DT

This is not your case.
Your controller is new and DT will have the correct
info

You are trying work around an ordering issue by providing both fw_name
and name. This is not correct and I'll continue to nack it.

If the orphan clock is not reparented as you would expect, I suggest you
try to look a bit further at how the reparenting of orphans is done in
CCF and why it does not match your expectation.
