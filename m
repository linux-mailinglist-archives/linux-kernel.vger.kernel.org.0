This roughly matches what I've seen. The interesting part to me for
netperf is the next section of the report that reports the locality of
numa hints. With netperf on a 2-socket machine, it's generally around
50% as the client/server are pulled apart. Because netperf is not
heavily memory bound, it doesn't have much impact on the overall
performance but it's good at catching the cross-node migrations.

Looks good.

Perfect. Any patch in that are can then update the comment and it
should be semi-obvious to the next reviewer that it's expected.

Thanks Vincent.
