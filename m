Thank you.  Standing back and looking from higher altitude, I missed
a second modulo at fallback_retry: which should be made consistent,
so I need a one re-spin.

Also, we could, if desired, eliminate the i variable entirely
using the fact that we have a copy of the starting position cached
in parent_group.  I.e.

 		g = parent_group = reciprocal_scale(grp, ngroups);
-		for (i = 0; i < ngroups; i++, ++g == ngroups && (g = 0)) {
+		do {
 			...
-		}
+			if (++g == ngroups)
+				g = 0;
+		} while (g != parent_group);

Or perhaps the following would be simpler, replacing the modulo
with a conditional subtract:

-		g = parent_group = reciprocal_scale(grp, ngroups);
+		parent_group = reciprocal_scale(grp, ngroups);
-		for (i = 0; i < ngroups; i++, ++g == ngroups && (g = 0)) {
+		for (i = 0; i < ngroups; i++) {
+			g = parent_group + i;
+			if (g >= ngroups)
+				g -= ngroups;

The conditional branch starts out always false, and ends up always true,
but except for a few bobbles when it switches, branch prediction should
handle it very well.

Any preference?

(Seriously, thank you for a second set of eyes.  This patch set
contains so many almost-identical changes that my eyes were glazing
over and I couldn't see bugs.)
