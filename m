I don't see it being checked on arm32 either.

Fair enough. Just want to make sure that it isn't some vestigial
property that was never used. Do you know if another OS is actually
using it?

Both enable-method and entry-method properties are currently only used
(and documented) for ARM platforms. Hence this discussion about
deprecation of one of them.

Only a couple of minor issues:
1. There is a trickle of DTs that need fixing up every now and then
because they don't use entry-method in their idle-states node. Schema
validation ought to fix that.
2. A property that isn't ready by any code is a bit confusing. Perhaps
we can mention something to the effect in the documentation?
