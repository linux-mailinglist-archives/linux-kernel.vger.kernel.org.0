I'm thinking you're clueless on realtime. There's plenty of things that
can cause many cycles to go out the window. And just a single
instruction soaking up cycles like that really isn't the problem.

The problem is that split lock defeats isolation. An otherwise contained
task can have pretty horrific side effects on other tasks.

Cloud vendors also don't want them. Nobody wants them, they stink. They
have a system wide impact.

I don't want them on my system.

Not good enough. Any system shipping with this capability needs to have
a split lock free firmware blob. And the only way to make that happen is
to force enable it by default.

Haven't we fixed them all by now?

I'm thinking most of the normal Linux userspace will run just fine.
Seeing how other architectures have rejected such nonsense forever.

We told you that wasn't good enough many times. Lot's of people run the
preemp-rt kernel on lots of different hardware. And like I said, even
cloudy folks would want this.

Features that require special firmware that nobody has are useless.

For giggles, run the below. You can notice your desktop getting slower.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>

void main(void)
{
	void *addr = mmap(NULL, 4096*2, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
	unsigned int *var;
	if (addr == (void*)-1) {
		printf("fail\n");
		return;
	}

	var = addr + 4096 - 2;

	for (;;)
		asm volatile ("lock incl %0" : : "m" (*var));
}
