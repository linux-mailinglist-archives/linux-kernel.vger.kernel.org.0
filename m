Hmm.  I have some memory of a /dev/ioport or similar, but now I can't
find it.  It does seem quite reasonable.

But, for uses like DPDK, /sys/.../resource0 seems like a *far* better
API, since it actually uses the kernel's concept of which io range
corresponds to which device instead of hoping that the mappings don't
change out from under user code.  And it has the added benefit that
it's restricted to a single device.
