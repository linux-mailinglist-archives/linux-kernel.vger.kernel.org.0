Note that using DT_SCHEMA_FILES may hide some errors in examples as
all other schemas (including the core ones) are not used for
validation. So just 'make dt_binding_check' needs to pass (ignoring
any other unrelated errors as it breaks frequently). Supposedly a
patch is coming explaining this in the documentation.

No requirement to fix dts file errors at this point.

Isn't that every instance? So drop.

Otherwise, assuming it all works:
