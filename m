In my tree it is a .txt file, I've not seen patches changing it. And I
disagree, rst is just as much 'a text file' as .c is.

And yet, they're a .txt file in my tree. And I've not seen a rename,
just this move.

I've no idea what :orphan: is. Text file don't have markup.

Pretty much all of then are core-api I tihnk, with exception of the one
that are ABI, which have nothing to do with API. And i've no idea where
GCC plugins go, but it's definitely nothing to do with drivers.

Many of the futex ones are about the sys_futex user API, which
apparently we have Documentation/userspace-api/ for.

Why are you doing this if you've no clue what they're on about?

Just randomly moving files about isn't helpful.
