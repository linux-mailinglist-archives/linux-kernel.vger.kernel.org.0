Lockdep doens't seen everything by far. E.g. a wait_event will be
caught by the annotations here, but not by lockdep. Plus lockdep does
not see through the wait_event, and doesn't realize if e.g. that event
will never signal because the worker is part of the deadlock loop.
cross-release was supposed to fix that, but seems like that will never
land.

And since we're talking about mmu notifiers here and gpus/dma engines.
We have dma_fence_wait, which can wait for any hw/driver in the system
that takes part in shared/zero-copy buffer processing. Which at least
on the graphics side is everything. This pulls in enormous amounts of
deadlock potential that lockdep simply is blind about and will never
see.

Arming might_sleep catches them all.

Cheers, Daniel

PS: Don't ask me about why we need these semantics for oom_reaper,
like I said just trying to follow the rules.
