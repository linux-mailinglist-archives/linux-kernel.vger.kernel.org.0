Ok. It's the same as sdm845 so I guess it's OK.

Ok. It's also the same as sdm845 so I guess it's OK. Would be nice to
properly model it though so we can be certain the clk is actually
enabled.

>=20

Why do you want to keep them critical and registered? I'm suggesting
that any clk that is marked critical and doesn't have a parent should
instead become a register write in probe to turn the clk on.
