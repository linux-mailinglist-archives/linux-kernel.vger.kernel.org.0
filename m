Yes, so you call __do_irq.  You have to make sure that what you tell the
compiler -- and what you *don't tell the compiler -- works with what the
ABIs require, and what the called function expects and provides.

The existing call_do_irq isn't C code.  It doesn't do anything with r2,
as far as I can see; __do_irq just gets whatever the caller of call_do_irq
has.

So I guess all the callers of call_do_irq have the correct r2 value always
already?  In that case everything Just Works.

It is enough for some things, sure.  But not all.
