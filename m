I'd slightly reword that as "These operations are mainly about managing
storage footprint. This happens to be the same as memory for tmpfs."
and then happily agree with it.

I'd strongly oppose letting MADV_REMOVE diverge from FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE:
if it came down to that, I would prefer to revert this patch.

It's good to consider the implications for hole-punch on a persistent
filesystem cached with THPs (or lower order compound pages); but I
disagree that they should behave differently from this patch.

The hole-punch is fundamentally directed at freeing up the storage, yes;
but its page cache must also be removed, otherwise you have the user
writing into cache which is not backed by storage, and potentially losing
the data later.  So a hole must be punched in the compound page in that
case too: in fact, it's then much more important that split_huge_page()
succeeds - not obvious what the fallback should be if it fails (perhaps
in that case the compound page must be kept, but all its pmds removed,
and info on holes kept in spare fields of the compound page, to prevent
writes and write faults without calling back into the filesystem:
soluble, but more work than tmpfs needs today)(and perhaps when that
extra work is done, we would choose to rely on it rather than
immediately splitting; but it will involve discounting the holes).
