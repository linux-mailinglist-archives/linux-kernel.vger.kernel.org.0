And working for sami-development, really is the same as EU principles 
and the €. A sign already on our keyboards, being the economy we want, 
going back to fair pay principles origin in Adams Tablet, (The Dispilio 
Artifact).

Put yourself right back the best of unix-derivative of this, and be a 
bit already there! All developments respected to now, with some 
tightening up of code and distro, and integration with an online € 
currency being perfect. And I know EU works on the digial side of things 
here.

This is definately what is happening these days, people.

Meaning a good unix-derivate I have called I/T LX.

So anyone wanting this should move their efforts to I/T LX.

Meaning globally a leading I/T culture to follow, and good for all.
