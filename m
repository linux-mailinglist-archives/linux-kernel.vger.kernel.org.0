Apologies for the late reply. A few comments below.

If the device is partitioned across multiple PM domains (it may need
several power rails), then that should be described with the "multi PM
domain" approach in the DTS. As in (ii).

Using "device links" is however optional, as it may depend on the use
case. If all multiple PM domains needs to be powered on/off together,
then it's certainly recommended to use device links.

However, if the PM domains can be powered on/off independently (one
can be on while another is off), then it's probably easier to operate
directly with runtime PM, on the returned struct *device from
dev_pm_domain_attach_by_id().

Also note, there is dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name(), which allows us to
specify a name for the PM domain in the DTS, rather than using an
index. This may be more future proof to use.

[...]

Hope this helps.

Kind regards
Uffe
