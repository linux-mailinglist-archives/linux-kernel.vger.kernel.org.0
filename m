It does seem so, but I think we can only reasonably do that where it's
only being shared across instances of the same driver, rather than when
the IRQ is muxed across completely independent drivers. I'd like to
avoid that latter case if we can.

The driver would have to handle migration on a cross-instance basis.
e.g. all the contexts need to be migrated before the IRQ is, to avoid a
screaming IRQ on the target CPU, or the IRQ handler on the target racing
with migration from the source.

Is there a neat way to do that in a driver without using IRQF_SHARED, so
that we don't end up accidentally sharing with other drivers? We can
probably librify the code to handle this under drivers/pmu/.

Thanks,
Mark.
