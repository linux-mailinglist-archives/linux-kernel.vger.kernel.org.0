Hi Sergey,

Many thanks for your feedback!

I take this passage as an acknowledgement of the problem being _real_,
in spite of the fix being not perfect.

One aspect I would like to emphasize is that (please, NAK this
statement if it's not accurate) the problem reported in this patch is
not specific to the existing printk mechanism, but also applies to the
upcoming kthread-based printk. If that's true, then IMHO this is a
compelling argument to join forces and try to find a working, safe and
future-proof solution.

This looks plausible. However, I wonder to which degree the same
scenario is a concern in the kthread-based approach?

My current standpoint is that as long as points [A-D] are met, it
should do no harm to accept a (partial) fix like seen in my series:

 - [A] the patch tackles at least a subset of problematic use-cases
 - [B] the fix is non-intrusive and easy to review
 - [C] there is hope to reuse it in the new lockless buffer based printk
 - [D] there are no regressions employing the major console knobs
       (ignore_loglevel, quiet, loglevel, etc) as it happened in
  a6ae928c25835c ("Revert "printk: make sure to print log on console."")

From the above points, my only major concern is that current series
breaks the expectations of users who pass loglevel=0 on kernel
command line and expect the system to be totally silent. This has
already been expressed in the cover letter. I would especially
appreciate if the same view is shared (or invalidated) by others.

Thanks for this reference. It looks to me that in spite of being
relatively compact, commit 375899cddcbb26 ("printk: make sure to print
log on console.") broke criteria [D] listed above. I intend to avoid
it by testing multiple console knob values on my arm64 system.

Looking forward to your feedback on the questions posted above. TIA!
