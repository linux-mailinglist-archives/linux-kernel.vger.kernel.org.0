It is indeed as straight forward as you explain; but when doing 10
things at once, and having just dug through some low-level arch assembly
code for the previous email, even obvious things might sometimes need
a little explaining :/

So please, always try and err on the side of a little verbose when
writing Changelogs, esp. when concerning locking / concurrency, you
really can't be clear enough.

See, had that explaination been part of the Changelog, my brain would've
probably been able to kick itself in gear and actually spot the problem.

Yes, you're right.

That said, I wonder if we can just move the get_task_struct() call like
below; after all the race we're guarding against is percpu_rwsem_wait()
observing !private, terminating the wait and doing a quick exit() while
percpu_rwsem_wake_function() then does wake_up_process(p) as a
use-after-free.

Hmm?
