Sorry, I don't understand this.  Are you saying that, for instance,
you can resume a 30 GB image on a 32 GB device, but that image could
only have been created on a 64 GB device?

Again, I don't understand.  Why did you make that suggestion then?

Unfortunately this doesn't work for me.  I may have described a simple
experiment: on a 4GB device, create two large processes like this:

dd if=/dev/zero bs=1100M count=1 | sleep infinity &
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1100M count=1 | sleep infinity &

so that more than 50% of TotalMem is used for anonymous pages.  Then
echo disk > /sys/power/state fails with ENOMEM.

Is this supposed to work?  Maybe I am doing something wrong?
Hibernation works before I create the dd processes.  After I force
some of those pages to a separate swap device, hibernation works too,
so those pages aren't mlocked or anything.

I apologize if I am doing something stupid and I should know better
before I waste other people's time.  I have been trying to explain
these issues as best as I can.  I have a reproducible failure.  I'll
be happy to provide any additional detail.

Sure, after we resolve the above questions.
