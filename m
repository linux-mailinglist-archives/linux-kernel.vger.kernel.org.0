Hi Kamal,

Richard, something to look into below :)

I feel there is something wrong with the current implementation
regarding partitions but I am not sure this is the right fix. Is this
something you detected with some kind of static checker or did you
actually experience an issue?

In the commit log you say "check mtd (I suppose you mean the
master) panic write flag and set the mtd partition panic write flag"
which makes sense, but in reality my understanding is that you do the
opposite: you check mtd->oops_panic_write which is the partitions'
structure, and set part->parent->oops_panic_write which is the master's
flag.

Also, I am not sure if it is worth checking anything, why not just set
mtd->oops_panic_write in this function?

Same comment for the -already existing- condition in mtd_panic_write.
As soon as we are in these functions, we know there is a panic, right?
So why checking if the bit is already set before forcing it?
