Keep in mind that this feature is also enabled by the wakeup tracers and by
hwlat. These are often enabled by production kernels.

I guess it would be possible to add some ifdefs so that we create a new
workqueue only if preempt/irqsoff tracing is enabled in the kernel 
config and
use system_highpri_wq if we only have the wakeup and hwlat tracers in the
config.

However, I don't really like adding yet some more ifdefs to the code.

Since a new workqueue will not necessariy create a new worker thread 
nowadays,
I thought that it would be OK with a new unbound workqueue, which should not
add much to the tendency to create more worker threads.

Ok, thanks. Could you let me know when you have looked through it all so 
that
I know when it makes sense to make another reroll of the series?
