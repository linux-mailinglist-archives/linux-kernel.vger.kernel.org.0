Most applications, even the ones which don't use explicit IOs much,
don't have set memory footprint which is uniformly accessed and there
needs to be some level of reclaim activity for the working set to be
established and maintained. Without IO control, memory protection
isn't enough in protecting the workload.

Even if we narrow down the discussion to something like memcache which
has fixed memory footprint with almost uniform access pattern, real
world applications don't exist in vacuum - they compete on CPU, have
to do logging, pulls in metric ton of libraries which implicitly
accesses stuff and so on. If somebody else is pummeling the filesystem
and there's no IO isolation set up, it'll stall noticeably every once
in a while.

Oh I see. If cgroup hierarchy isn't set up for resource control,
resource control not working well seems par for the course. I mean, no
other controllers would work anyway, so I'm having a hard time to see
what the point is. What we ultimately want is cgroup actually being
useful for its primary purpose of resource control while supporting
other organizational use cases and while the established usages aren't
there yet I haven't seen anything fundamentally blocking that.

Thanks.
