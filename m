Hi everyone,

This is v2 of my A10/A20 CSI1 and R40 CSI0 series. v2 is simply the
remaining patches rebased on top of linux-next 20200106, with the
MBUS device tree binding changes converted to YAML format.

This series adds basic support for CSI1 on Allwinner A10/A20 and CSI0 on
Allwinner R40. The CSI1 block has the same structure and layout as the
CSI0 block. Differences include:

  - Only one channel in BT.656 instead of four in CSI0
  - 10-bit raw data input vs 8-bit in CSI0
  - 24-bit RGB888/YUV444 input vs 16-bit RGB565/YUV422 in CSI0
  - No ISP hardware (CSI SCLK not needed)

The CSI0 block in the Allwinner R40 SoC looks to be the same as the one
in the A20. The register maps line up, and they support the same
features. The R40 appears to support BT.1120 based on the feature
overview, but it is not mentioned anywhere else. Also like the A20, the
ISP is not mentioned, but the CSI special clock needs to be enabled for
the hardware to function. The manual does state that the CSI special
clock is the TOP clock for all CSI hardware, but currently no hardware
exists for us to test if CSI1 also depends on it or not.

Included are a couple of fixes for signal polarity and DRAM offset
handling.

Patches 1 and 2 add CSI1 to A10 (sun4i) and A20 (sun7i) dtsi files.

Patch 3 adds a compatible string for the R40's MBUS (memory bus).
This patch needs to go through Rob's tree as it now depends on
the patch "dt-bindings: interconnect: Convert Allwinner MBUS
controller to a schema" that was already merged.

Patch 4 adds CSI0 to the R40 dtsi file

Patches 5 through 7 are examples of cameras hooked up to boards.


Regards
ChenYu
