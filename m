Ah, you are right, you only have one misc device here.  No, that's not
good, but you can use it for some messages (your ioctl errors), but
ideally you will have a struct device somewhere for each of the
"instances" you create, right?  That is what you should use for that.

Ok, that's fine.  But it feels odd creating a driver dynamically to me,
but it should work (as you show.)  It doesn't give you something to use
for the dev_* messages directly, ah, but you do have something:

There, use that pointer for your dev_* messages, and you should be fine.

It's late, but there should be some lock somewhere to prevent a race
around this type of thing.  That's why we have kref_put_mutex() and
kref_put_lock().

Odds are you are fine here, but just something to be aware of...
