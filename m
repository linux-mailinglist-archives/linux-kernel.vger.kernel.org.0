One would have to track only the arches that have
force_dma_unecrypted(), and generally speaking the arches shall make
sure the DMA ops are suitable, whatever that means in the given context.

I don't agree. The spec explicitly states "If this feature bit is set
to 0, then the device has same access to memory addresses supplied to it
as the driver has." That ain't any guest memory, but the addresses
supplied to it. BTW this is how channel I/O works as well: the channel
program authorizes the device to use the memory locations specified by
the channel program, for as long as the channel program is executed.
That's how channel I/O does isolation without an architected IOMMU.

Can you please show me the words in the specification that say, the
device has to have access to the entire guest memory all the time?

Maybe I have to understand all the intentions behind
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM better. I've read the spec several times, but I
still have the feeling, when we discuss, that I didn't get it right.
IOMMUs and PCI style DMA are unfortunately not my bread and butter.

I only know that the devices do not need any new device capability (I
assume VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM does express a device capability), to
work with protected virtualization. Unless one defines
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is the capability that the device won't poke
*arbitrary* guest memory.  From that perspective mandating the flag
feels wrong. (CCW devices are never allowed to poke arbitrary
memory.)

Yet, if VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is a flag that every nice and modern
virtio device should have (i.e. a lack of it means kida broken), then I
have the feeling virtio-ccw should probably evolve in the direction, that
having VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM set does not hurt.

I have to think some more.

Seems Christoph does not like that idea.

I thought Christoph wants that, but I was wrong.

Agreed. From s390 perspective, I think it ain't to bad if we get GFP_DMA.

Many thanks for your patience!
