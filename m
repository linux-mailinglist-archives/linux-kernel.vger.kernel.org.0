You have to consider that some of those are addressed by a single
mitigation like MDS; the mitigation for others like lazy FPU restore
is not even present in /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/. Also,
depending on the CPU, some are not even affected.

So maintaining this in the kernel is unnecessary to say the least.

We could use a writeup somewhere which maps each vulnerability name -
and they're a gazillion by now - to the respective mitigation and what
is required but I'm not aware of such a writeup.

Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/ could be a good start and
Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.rst could be a good example how
one should document the vulnerabilities and their mitigation. But that
would need to be exhaustive.

IMHO of course.
