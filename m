The user is the next (small) patch in this series:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/19/475

Let's assume virtio-mem added a memory block and that block was onlined 
(e.g. by user space). E.g. 128MB.

On request, virtio-mem used alloc_contig_range() to logically unplug all 
chunks (e.g., 4MB) of that memory block. virtio-mem marked all pages 
PG_offline and dropped the reference count to 0 (to allow the memory 
block to get offlined). Basically no memory of the memory block is still 
in use by the system. So it is very desirable to remove that memory 
block along with the vmemmap and the page tables. This frees up memory.

In order to remove the memory block, it first has to be officially 
offlined (e.g., make the memory block as offline). Then, the memory 
block can get cleanly removed. Otherwise, try_remove_memory() will fail.

To do this, virtio-mem needs an interface to perform both steps (offline 
+ remove).

There is no interface for a driver to offline a memory block. What I 
propose here performs both steps (offline+remove) in a single step, as 
that is really what the driver wants.
