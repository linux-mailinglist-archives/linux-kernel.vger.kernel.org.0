I've applied this to the docs tree.

However, Ayush: the patch was rather badly corrupted by your mail client.
I managed to fix it up, but please in the future verify that you can email
a patch to yourself and apply it before submitting it.  There may be some
useful hints in Documentation/process/email-clients.rst .

Thanks,

jon
