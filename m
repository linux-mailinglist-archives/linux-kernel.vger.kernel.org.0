I had been wondering why I'd been included on this thread.  I completely 
forgot that I wrote this code nearly 15 years ago. :)

It was probably as simple as there not being a real limit for how long 
the compatible string could be and wanting to make it flexible.  I was 
targetting a powerpc mac notebook I had at the time -- not tight memory 
embedded systems, so sorry for that.

The size is part of the ABI, though.  module-init-tools has a copy of 
the same struct and uses that size to walk an array of of_device_id when 
a module as more than one.  If you shrink it, that will certainly break.

file2alias does the right things only because it's tightly coupled to 
the kernel version it's being used with.  It still directly accesses the 
structure definitions in the headers.
