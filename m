That was my plan today. I'll fire up a new VM and run the test there as well
(after which, I can pull the .config myself).

Richard: (not sure if you are still reading these) .. do we have any easily
accessible images that we could share that show the problem ? If not, that
is probably something I can look into for the future.

I can report that I was able to see the problem again on a freshly cloned
linux-stable 5.2.17 yesterday. When I pulled in the x86_64_defconfig, the
test time went to ~4 seconds.

So I've been looking through the config delta's and late last night, I was
able to move the runtime back to a failed 4 minute state by adding the
CONFIG_PREEMPT settings that we have by default in our reference
kernel.

# CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPTIRQ_EVENTS is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_TRACER is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPTIRQ_DELAY_TEST is not set

Where in the x86_64_defconfig, it was PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY. I
only ran this test late last night, so I haven't had a chance to see what
else changed in the config, or compare it to fedora or other default
configurations .. but I thought it was still useful to share that finding.
