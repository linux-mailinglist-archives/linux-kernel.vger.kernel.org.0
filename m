As far as I understand it, this commit is not suitable for backporting.
The link above explains the problem for a similar patch:

	But I believe this would introduce a rather ugly bug in
	mfd_remove_devices() if the first sub-device is set to disabled:
	It iterates over the children devices to find the base address
	of the allocated "usage count" array, which is then used to free it.
	If the first sub-device is missing, it would free the wrong address.

This problem does not exist in mainline because the MFD usage counting
was removed entirely as part of the larger "Simplify MFD Core" series [1].

None of the device trees in the stable kernels should depend on
disabling MFD devices from the device tree. (They were written at a time
when the MFD core ignored that request entirely...)
Therefore, I would suggest to drop this patch entirely.
