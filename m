NAND flash requires ECC so is likely to be async.
But I2C is clocked from the cpu end - so is fixed.

Also an embedded system could be booting off a large serial EEPROM.
These have fixed timings and are clocked from the cpu end.

So until you get any ethernet interface up and can look at receive packet
timings there isn't likely to be any randomness at all.
A high resolution voltage  (or temperature) monitor might generate noise
in its LSB - but they don't often have a higher resolution than the stability
of the signal.

I can't remember (from the start of this thread) why 'speculation' is expected to
generate randomness.
I'd have thought the loop was deterministic - but you don't know the initial state.
More iterations may just be amplifying the initial small randomness - rather than
generating extra randomness.
So while it gets the system to boot, it hasn't actually done its job.
