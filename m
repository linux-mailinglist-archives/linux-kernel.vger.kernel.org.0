The crucial constraints for implementing Windows synchronization 
primitives in Wine are that (a) it must be possible to access them from 
multiple processes and (b) it must be possible to wait on more than one 
at a time.

The current best solution for this, performance-wise, backs each Windows 
synchronization primitive with an eventfd(2) descriptor and uses poll(2) 
to select on them. Windows programs can create an apparently unbounded 
number of synchronization objects, though they can only wait on up to 64 
at a time. However, on Linux the NOFILE limit causes problems; some 
distributions have it as low as 4096 by default, which is too low even 
for some modern programs that don't leak objects.

The approach we are developing, that relies on this patch, backs each 
object with a single futex whose value represents its signaled state. 
Therefore the only resource we are at risk of running out of is 
available memory, which exists in far greater quantities than available 
descriptors. [Presumably Windows synchronization primitives require at 
least some kernel memory to be allocated per object as well, so this 
puts us essentially at parity, for whatever that's worth.]

To be clear, I think the primary impetus for developing the futex-based 
approach was performance; it lets us avoid some system calls in hot 
paths (e.g. waiting on an already signaled object, resetting the state 
of an object to unsignaled. In that respect we're trying to get ahead of 
Windows, I guess.) But we have still been encountering occasional grief 
due to NOFILE limits that are too low, so this is another helpful benefit.
