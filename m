I see that you're just going to ignore
Universal City Studios Inc v Reimerdes

Instead you address your emotional issues. This is the making of a 
beast: which is what you are. Driven by your instincts.

You want to violate the linux copyright. You announced your intent 
(which increases the damages you are liable for under US jurisprudence.)

The facts are simple: You may not execute the scheme you are suggesting. 
If you do execute the scheme you or suggesting, or if you assist others 
in doing so then you are liable for copyright infringement (direct or 
contributory). If you make over 1000 dollars off of this infringement 
you are liable for criminal penalties as-well.

The courts see unlicensed modification of another copyright-holders 
work, in memory, while running, as the creation of an unlicensed 
derivative work.

It does not matter how you try to sugar coat it or change your 
description, nor do your complaints of me CC'ing relevant parties (a 
diversion technique by you) who could explain this all to you in ways 
you could understand, change anything. The courts in the USA see this 
type of action you suggest as the creation of a derivative work.

Thus you must follow the permissions and must not overstep them. That is 
all. Having non-gpl modules work as you describe violates the linux 
kernel copyright just as the plugin in the Reimerdes case violated the 
RealPlayer copyright: in both cases the situation involves "modules" 
extending the running program in real-time, in both cases the "modules" 
are not permitted by the copyright owners to do as they wish: and the 
Court agreed.
