Yeah, to be exact it's that. It's just that this is only relevant at all
when NUMCPUs*min_cfs_rq_runtime is at least a significant fraction of
quota, and when "scheduled on distinct cpus, and then never run again"
happens. How sequential it needs to be depends on the threads vs num
cpus.

Yeah, I think I was misremembering or thinking only about one example or
something. Meanwhile I'm thinking this is potentially /worse/ than just
2x runtime per 2x period, though obviously it depends on cpus vs quota.


One thing I'm trying now is if we made the slack timer go and collect
all the min_cfs_rq_runtime left behind, which would provide something
similar to the min=0 case for fixing not only this but other cases of
stranding bandwidth, but also some level of rate limiting.
