Hi,

I ended up not reviewing this patch in detail simply because I would
approach the same class of problem in an entirely different way today.
There is value in accumulating the stats in a report like this;

However, the basic option I would prefer is having the raw latency
information for Direct latency that can be externally parsed by R or any
other statistical method. The reason why is because knowing the max latency
is not enough, I'd want to know the spread of latencies and whether they
were clustered at a point of time or spread out over long periods of
time. I would then build the higher-level reports on top if necessary.

Today, I would also have considered getting the latency figures using eBPF
or systemtap instead although having perf do it may be useful too. That's
not universally popular though so at minimum I would have;

perf script record page-reclaim -- capture all page-reclaim tracepoints
perf script report page-reclaim -- For reclaim entry/exit, merge the two
	tracepoints into one that reports latency. Dump the rest out
	verbatim

For latencies, I would externally post-process them until such time as I
found a common class of bug that needed a high-level report and then
build the perf script support for it.

Please note that I did not spot anything wrong with your script, it's
just that I would not use it myself in its current format for debugging
a reclaim-related problem.
