The code does bail out on any direct reclaim - be it limit or page
allocator triggered. Check the !current_is_kswapd part of the condition.

What is the usual direct reclaim involvement on those machines?

I do not see how shrink_node_memcg bail out helps here. We do scan up-to
SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages for each LRU at least once. So we are getting to
nr_memcgs_with_pages multiplier with the patch applied in the worst case.

How much that matters is another question and it depends on the
number of cgroups and the rate the direct reclaim happens. I do not
remember exact numbers but even walking a very large memcg tree was
noticeable.

For the over reclaim part SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX is a relatively small number
so even hundreds of memcgs on a "reasonably" sized system shouldn't be
really observable (we are talking about 7MB per reclaim per reclaimer on
1k memcgs with pages). This would get worse with many reclaimers. Maybe
we will need something like the regular direct reclaim throttling of
mmemcg limit reclaim as well in the future.

That being said, I do agree that the oom side of the coin is causing
real troubles and it is a real problem to be addressed first. Especially with
cgroup v2 where we have likely more memcgs without any pages because
inner nodes do not have any tasks and direct charges which makes some
reclaimers hit memcgs without pages more likely.

Let's see whether we see regression due to over-reclaim.

With the direct reclaim bail out reference fixed - unless I am wrong
there of course

It is sad to see this piece of fun not being used after that many years
of bugs here and there and all the lockless fun but this is the life
;)
