There's already a node in sysfs for every coreboot table entry:

  /sys/bus/coreboot/devices/corebootN

where N is the index of the entry in the coreboot table. I suggest

1) Rename the devices based on their tag instead of their position in the table,
   so the names are stable and meaningful. I don't know why I didn't do that in
   the first place. Doing that gives you a device kobject you can hang
   additional sysfs attributes off of.
2) If we want userspace to have access to the raw binary table entry (which
   sounds like a good idea to me), add that sysfs attribute in
   coreboot_table_populate() after creating each device. That way it would be
   present regardless of whether or not there's a specific driver loaded for
   that table entry.

This solves the immediate problem of needing /dev/mem to access coreboot tables,
while leaving open the possibility of writing kernel drivers in the future if
that would be more beneficial than parsing the data in userspace (i.e. if the
kernel can do something more with the data than just exporting it).
