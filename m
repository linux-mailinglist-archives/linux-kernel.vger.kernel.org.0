gx6605s.dts is simple now, it's unnecessary to seperate it into two
pieces. Other things from you is all OK for me.

Copyright could be the same in arch/csky/kernel/setup.c or add yours
in addition.

leds and button is so specific, that's is just a example. You could
keep your own style in the dts.

Seems there is no driver for it.

I try this 1 years ago in linux-4.9 and it need verifying.

Name is Ok for me as long as it's correct.

csky is my current company and nationalchip is my prior company. The
gx6605s is belong to nationachip and gx6605s use csky 610 as its CPU.

It's defined in irqchip/irq-csky-apb-intc.c.
