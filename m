I usually git grep for the function and that covers many cases. But
realistically, I am more than skeptical people are going to do a regular
cleanup like that. And that is the biggest deal with this annotation.
Once it gets marked it will just stay that way and potentially get
really unused eventually. So the overall benefit is close the zero in
that case.

Maybe dropping -Wunused-function is an overreaction. Git log shows there
has been some code removed which is probably the most viable reaction to
those reports. Maybe we just want to add those for W=1 or something like
that.

I believe that both possitive and negative reaction to _any_ patch has
to be properly justified - same applies to the patch itself. A warning
report/fix is not an expcetion. In this particular case it has been pointed
out that the reported function is a general purpose one which just
happens to be used only for CONFIG_SWAP (rather than CONFIG_MMU) and
using additional ifdeferry is likely not going to help long term.
