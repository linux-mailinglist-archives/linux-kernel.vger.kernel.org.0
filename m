Since the MMIO layout is that of the SiFive clint, the compatible string
should be specific to that. e.g. "sifive,clint". That way it will be
possible to distinguish it from other implementations.

What exactly is the "0" suffix for? Is that a version number?

If that's a CPU index, then I don't think that's the right way to encode
this unless the programming interface actually differs across CPUs. It
would be better to use an explicit phandle to express the affinity.

Thanks,
Mark.
