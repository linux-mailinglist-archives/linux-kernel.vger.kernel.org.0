This needs a vastly better description. Perhaps:

When remapping an anonymous, private mapping, if MREMAP_DONTUNMAP is set, th=
e source mapping will not be removed. Instead it will be cleared as if a bra=
nd new anonymous, private mapping had been created atomically as part of the=
 mremap() call.  If a userfaultfd was watching the source, it will continue t=
o watch the new mapping.  For a mapping that is shared or not anonymous, MRE=
MAP_DONTUNMAP will cause the mremap() call to fail.

Or is it something else?

Does this mean you yank it out but you want to replace it simultaneously?
