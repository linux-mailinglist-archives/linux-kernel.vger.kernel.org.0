Neil has provided a nice explanation down the email thread. But let me
clarify few things here.

There is no explicit mechanism which is indeed unfortunate. The only
user real user of the flag is Swap over NFS AFAIK. I have never dared to
look into details on how the complete reserves depletion is prevented.
Mel would be much better fit here.

You are right that this is the usecase for the flag. But this should be
done with an extreme care because the core MM relies on those reserves
so any other users should better make sure they do not consume a lot
from reserves as well.

Maybe we need to refine this documentation to be more explicit about an
extreme care to be taken when using the flag.
