Hi Rasmus,

Nice idea!

Still, it looks a bit wasteful to me to include the dash in each and every
string value.

Do you think you can code the +/- logic in string_nocheck() in less than
the gain achieved by dropping the dashes from the tables?
(e.g. by using the SIGN spec.flags? ;-)
Or, do we need it? IS_ERR() doesn't consider positive values errors.

Oh, what about the leading "E"? That one looks harder to get rid of,
though ;-)

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
