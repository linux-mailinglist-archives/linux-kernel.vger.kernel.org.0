I will add some more labels to complete the picture. All these events
are within this function:

D: the WRITE_ONCE() to @seq

E: the STORE of a successful cmpxchg() for @newest (the MB5-write
cmpxchg())

F: the STORE of a new @next (the last smp_store_release() of this
function, note that the _release() is not relevant for this pair)

The significant events for 2 contexts that are accessing the same
addresses of a descriptor are:

P0(struct desc *d0)
{
        // adding a new descriptor d0

        WRITE_ONCE(d0->next, EOL);               // C
        WRITE_ONCE(d0->seq, X);                  // D
        cmpxchg_release(newest, Y, indexof(d0)); // E
}

P1(struct desc *d1)
{
        // adding a new descriptor d1 that comes after d0

        struct desc *d0;
        int r0, r1;

        r0 = READ_ONCE(newest);                 // A
        d0 = &array[r0];
        r1 = READ_ONCE(d0->seq);                // B
        WRITE_ONCE(d0->next, Z);                // F
}

d0 is the same address for P0 and P1. (The values of EOL, X, Y, Z are
unrelated and irrelevant.)

I am claiming that:

- B comes after D
- F comes after C

Sorry. The MB0-read is a _new_ comment that would be added to the
smp_rmb() of the reader functions. I didn't repost everything because I
just wanted to get a feel if the comments for _this_ function are
improving. Really all I care about right now is properly documenting
MB5. It is a good example because MB5 is completely within this
function. If I can satisfactorily document MB5, then I can post a new
version with updated comments for everything.

I feel like I'm stating all the information, but nobody understands it.
If you can help me to correctly document MB5, I can submit a new version
with all the memory barriers correctly documented.
