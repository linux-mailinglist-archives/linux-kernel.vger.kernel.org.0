Do the x86 versions of grub, qemu, EFI, any other bootloader actually
enable DT support? I didn't think so. Certainly, an x86 kernel doesn't
normally (other than OLPC and ce4100) have a defined way to even pass
a dtb from the bootloader to the kernel and the kernel doesn't
unflatten the dtb.

For arm64, the bootloader to kernel interface is DT even for ACPI
based systems. So unlike Frank, I'm not completely against DT being
the interface, but it's hardly universal across architectures and
something like this should be. Neither making DT the universal kernel
boot interface nor creating some new channel as Frank suggested seems
like an easy task.
