I'd like to get the 'pp done time out' errors that are now occurring
upstream for command-mode panels fixed. As I mentioned above, this patch
fixes the problem on the Nexus 5 and the pp done interrupts are
delivered at approximately 60 HZ. I don't have any other command-mode
panels to test.

I'm not sure how to proceed here since sending the start command breaks
the display. I'm likely putting that command in the wrong spot.
