Subject: [PATCH v3 1/3] arm64: dts: allwinner: Fix wrong license header
Date:   Sat, 14 Dec 2019 14:26:40 +0100
Message-Id: <20191214132642.29564-1-peron.clem@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.20.1
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some headers specify that files are under dual-licensed GPL2.0+
and X11. But in fact, it turns out that the full licenses texts
associated are GPL2.0+ and MIT.

Fix license headers to reflect real licenses associated.
