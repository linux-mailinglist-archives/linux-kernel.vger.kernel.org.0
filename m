The current state is not necessarily bad or unhelpful. I just though that it
could be improved upon. Some how calling out explicitly only the CMA page
failure case just felt adhoc, where as there are other reasons like HugeTLB
immovability which might depend on other factors apart from just page flags
(though I did not propose that originally).

Okay, probably I should have explained more on why "unmovable" is less than
adequate to capture the exact reason for specific failure cases and how
"Reserved Page" instead would been better. But got the point, will improve.
