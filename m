I was not involved in the mail thread and wondering what the litmus test
looked like. Some searching of the archive has suggested that Alan presented
a properly formatted test based on Herbert's idea in [1].

[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Pine.LNX.4.44L0.1906041026570.1731-100000@iolanthe.rowland.org/

If this is the case, adding the link (or message id) in the change
log would help people see the circumstances, I suppose.
Paul, can you amend the change log?

I ran herd7 on said litmus test at both "lkmm" and "dev" of -rcu and
confirmed that this patch fixes the result.

So,

        Thanks, Akira
