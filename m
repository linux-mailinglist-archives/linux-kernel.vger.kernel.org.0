I believe that ->setup() can succeesfully be called only once.
It is tricky like hell:

1st piece:

	if (!has_preferred || bcon || !console_drivers)
		has_preferred = preferred_console >= 0;

  note:

     + "has_preferred" is updated here only when it was not "true" before.
     + "has_preferred" is set to "true" here only when "preferred_console"
       is set in __add_preferred_console()

2nd piece:

  + __add_preferred_console() is called for console defined on
    the command line. "preferred_console" points to the console
    defined by the last "console=" parameter.

3rd piece:

  + "has_preferred" is set to "true" later in register_console() when
    a console with tty binding gets enabled.

4th piece:

  + The code:

	/*
	 *	See if we want to use this console driver. If we
	 *	didn't select a console we take the first one
	 *	that registers here.
	 */
	if (!has_preferred)
		... try to enable the given console

   The comment is a bit unclear. The code is used as a fallback
   when no console was defined on the command line.

   Note that "has_preferred" is always true when "preferred_console"
   was defined via command line, see 2nd piece above.


By other words:

  + The fallback code (4th piece) is called only when
    "preferred_console" was not defined on the command line.

  + The cycle below matches the given console only when
    it was defined on the command line.


As a result, I believe that ->setup() could never be called
in both paths for the same console. Especially I think that
fallback code should not be used when the console was defined on
the command line.

I am not 100% sure but I am ready to risk this. Anyway, I think
that many ->setup() callbacks are not ready to be successfully
called twice.

(Sigh, I have started to clean up this code two years ago.
But I have never found time to finish the patchset. It is
such a huge mess.)

I would do:

	if (!res && console->exit)
		console->exit(console);

I mean. I would call ->exit() only when console->setup() succeeded in
register_console(). In this case, the console was later added to
the console_drivers list.
