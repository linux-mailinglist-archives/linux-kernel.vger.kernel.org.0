I'm wondering why we need a new map property rather than just using
interrupt-map? Contrary to what Linus said, it is not PCI only.

It would be an extension of the current behavior. It's generally used
to map each interrupt to different parents or swizzle the routing (in
the PCI case). Generally, a node would be either an
'interrupt-controller' or an 'interrupt-map' node. The interrupt
parsing code (for the kernel at least) prioritizes
'interrupt-controller' path, so adding 'interrupt-map' could be done
without changing behavior.

Another concern I have with this is it only solves the problem of an
IRQ routed to multiple parents for the case of 2 parents. What happens
when we have an IRQ routed to 3 different parents? Maybe the solution
is the incoming-interrupt-specifier can be listed more than once. Marc
already expressed concerns with the scalability of interrupt-map
property, so that's maybe not an ideal solution.

The phandle doesn't count as a cell, so this should be 2.
