It doesn't make any sense to have an endpoint with maxpacket = 0 --
either real or emulated.  The USB spec doesn't prohibit them (probably
an oversight), but such endpoints would be useless since it would not
be possible to transfer any data to/from them.

And as you surmised, it wouldn't be at all surprising for UDC drivers
to crash (much like dummy-hcd does) when faced with an endpoint having
maxpacket = 0.  Best to rule out the possibility entirely.
