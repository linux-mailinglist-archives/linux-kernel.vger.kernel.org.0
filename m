Thanks for pointing out the rule of drivers/staging.
The acrn staging driver is one self-contained driver. But it has some 
dependency on arch/x86/acrn and need to call the APIs in arch/x86/acrn.

If there is no driver,  the API without user had better not be added.
If API is not added,  the driver can't be compiled correctly.
The ACRN driver is one new driver. Maybe it will have some bugs and not 
be mature. So we want to add the driver as the staging.

What is the better approach to handle such scenario?

Ok. The TODO file will be added in next version.
