Yes. It is the list_for_each over the free_list that needs the lock and
that is the actual problem here. This can be really large with a _lot_
of memory. And this is why I objected to the patch. Because it doesn't
really address this problem. I would like to hear from Mel and Vlastimil
how would they feel about making free_list fully migrate type aware
(including nr_free).

Vlastimil would know much better but I have seen this being used for
fragmentation related debugging. That should imply that 0400 should be
sufficient and a quick and easily backportable fix for the most pressing
immediate problem.
