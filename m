With Ubuntu's libc6-m68k-cross installed, the selftest binaries cross-build
fine.  Running them on a very old Debian requires some hackery:

  1. Copy ld.so.1, ld-2.27.so, libc.so.6, and libc-2.27.so from
     /usr/m68k-linux-gnu/lib/ to /tmp/lib on the m68k target,
  2. mkdir /tmp/proc && mount proc /tmp/proc -t proc,
  3. chroot /tmp /tmp/<test-binary>.

Unfortunately some tests failed:
