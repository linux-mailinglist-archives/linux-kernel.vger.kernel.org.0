I've been pouring through the rpmh-rsc code and trying to understand
it.  Document everything to the best of my ability.  All documentation
here is strictly from code analysis--no actual knowledge of the
hardware was used.  If something is wrong in here I either
misunderstood the code, had a typo, or the code has a bug in it
leading to my incorrect understanding.

In a few places here I have documented things that don't make tons of
sense.  A future patch will try to address this.  While this means I'm
adding comments / todos and then later fixing them in the series, it
seemed more urgent to get things documented first so that people could
understand the later patches.

This should be a no-op.  It's just comment changes.

Signed-off-by: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

Changes in v2:
- More clear that active-only xfers can happen on wake TCS sometimes.
- Document locks for updating "tcs_in_use" more.
- Document tcs_is_free() without drv->lock OK for tcs_invalidate().
- Document bug of tcs_write() not handling -EAGAIN.
- Document get_tcs_for_msg() => -EAGAIN only for ACTIVE_ONLY.
- Reword tcs_write() doc a bit.
- Document two get_tcs_for_msg() issues if zero-active TCS.
- Document that rpmh_rsc_send_data() can be an implicit invalidate.
- Fixed documentation of "tcs" param in find_slots().

+ * find_match() - Find if the cmd sequence is in the tcs_group
+ * @tcs: The tcs_group to search.  Either sleep or wake.
+ * @cmd: The command sequence to search for; only addr is looked at.
+ * @len: The number of commands in the sequence.
+ *
+ * Searches through the given tcs_group to see if a given command sequence
+ * is in there.
+ *
+ * Two sequences are matches if they modify the same set of addresses in
+ * the same order.  The value of the data is not considered when deciding if
+ * two things are matches.
+ *
+ * How this function works is best understood by example.  For our example,
+ * we'll imagine our tcs group contains these (cmd, data) tuples:
+ *   [(a, A), (b, B), (c, C), (d, D), (e, E), (f, F), (g, G), (h, H)]
+ * ...in other words it has an element where (addr=a, data=A), etc.
+ * ...we'll assume that there is one TCS in the group that can store 8 commands.
+ *
+ * - find_match([(a, X)]) => 0
+ * - find_match([(c, X), (d, X)]) => 2
+ * - find_match([(c, X), (d, X), (e, X)]) => 2
+ * - find_match([(z, X)]) => -ENODATA
+ * - find_match([(a, X), (y, X)]) => -EINVAL (and warning printed)
+ * - find_match([(g, X), (h, X), (i, X)]) => -EINVAL (and warning printed)
+ * - find_match([(y, X), (a, X)]) => -ENODATA
+ *
+ * NOTE: This function overall seems like it has questionable value.
+ * - It can be used to update a message in the TCS with new data, but I
+ *   don't believe we actually do that--we always fully invalidate and
+ *   re-write everything.  Specifically it would be too limiting to force
+ *   someone not to change the set of addresses written to each time.
+ * - This function could be attempting to avoid writing different data to
+ *   the same address twice in a tcs_group.  If that's the goal, it doesn't
+ *   do a great job since find_match([(y, X), (a, X)]) return -ENODATA in my
+ *   above example.
+ * - If you originally wrote [(a, A), (b, B), (c, C)] and later tried to
+ *   write [(a, A), (b, B)] it'd look like a match and we wouldn't consider
+ *   it an error that the size got shorter.
+ * - If two clients wrote sequences that happened to be placed in slots next
+ *   to each other then a later check could match a sequence that was the
+ *   size of both together.
+ *
+ * TODO: in light of the above, prehaps we can just remove this function?
+ * If we later come up with fancy algorithms for updating everything without
+ * full invalidations we can come up with something then.
+ *
+ * Only for use on sleep/wake TCSs since those are the only ones we maintain
+ * tcs->slots and tcs->cmd_cache for.
+ *
+ * Must be called with the tcs_lock for the group held.
+ *
+ * Return: If the given command sequence wasn't in the tcs_group: -ENODATA.
+ *         If the given command sequence was in the tcs_group: the index of
+ *         the slot in the tcs_group where the first command is.
+ *         In some error cases (see above), -EINVAL.
