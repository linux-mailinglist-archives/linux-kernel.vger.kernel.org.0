I'm open to updating the headers to make a section heading that
matches what you're trying to convey, however that header definition
should be globally agreed upon. I don't want the document that tries
to clarify per-subsystem behaviours itself to have per-subsystem
permutations. I think we, subsystem maintainers, at least need to be
able to agree on the topics we disagree on. Would it be sufficient if
I just clarified that "Submit Checklist Addendum" also includes
guidance about which patches are out of scope for submission in the
first instance?
