I analysed the upstream kernel about audit, and found there is no significant change
in audit_names add/read/delete since v3.10.

audit_names could be delete in __audit_syscall_exit, do_exit, copy_process
on upstream kernel(same as v3.10).

if we are reading audit_names, such as
	__audit_syscall_exit
		audit_filter_inodes
			read each audit_names ...
			

is there any situation could delete audit_names at the same time?
