I'm not convinced this is the right approach, and if we decide to go this w=
ay,
there are more changes to take into account.

For one, if we create a dt node for this driver, we'd have to delete the
platform device creation in firmware/raspberrypi.c and then we'd be even ab=
le
to bypass raspberrypi-cpufreq altogether by creating opp tables in dt. But
there are reasons we didn't go that way at the time.

We've made an effort to avoid using dt for firmware interfaces whenever
possible as, on one hand, it's arguable they don't fit device-tree's hardwa=
re
description paradigm and, on the other, the lack of flexibility they impose
once the binding is defined. VC4's firmware interfaces are not set in stone=
,
nor standardized like SCMI, so the more flexible we are to future changes t=
he
better.

Another thing I'm not all that happy about it's how dynamic clock registeri=
ng
is handled in patch #22 (but I'll keep it here as relevant to the discussio=
n):

- Some of those fw managed clocks you're creating have their mmio counterpa=
rt
  being registered by clk-bcm238. IMO either register one or the other, giv=
ing
  precedence to the mmio counterpart. Note that for pllb, we deleted the
  relevant code from clk-bcm2385.

- The same way we were able to map the fw CPU clock into the clk tree
  (pllb/pllb_arm) there are no reasons we shouldn't be able to do the same =
for
  the VPU clocks. It's way nicer and less opaque to users (this being a
  learning platform adds to the argument).

- On top of that, having a special case for the CPU clock registration is
  nasty. Lets settle for one solution and make everyone follow it.

- I don't see what's so bad about creating clock lookups. IIUC there are on=
ly
  two clocks that need this special handling CPU & HDMI, It's manageable. Y=
ou
  don't even have to mess with the consumer driver, if there was ever to be=
 a
  dt provided mmio option to this clock.

There is no such phandle in the upstream device tree. Maybe this was aimed =
at
the downstream dt?
