Sure. It could, but it's up to the scheduler to decide. In general it's the
right thing to run the threaded handler on the CPU which handles the
interrupt. With single CPU affinity thats surely a limitation.

So your interrupt is affined to more than one CPU, but due to the ITS
limitation the effective affinity is a single CPU, which in turn restricts
the thread handler affinity to the same single CPU. If you lift that
restriction and let it be affine to the full affinity set of the interrupt
then you get better performance, right? Probably because the other CPU(s)
in the affinity set are less loaded than the one which handles the hard
interrupt.

This is heavily use case dependent I assume, so making this a general
change is perhaps not a good idea, but we could surely make this optional.

Thanks,
