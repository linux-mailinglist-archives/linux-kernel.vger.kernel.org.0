looking at patch 04/11 I see what you mean
(I'm describing it in my own words to make sure I got it right)
we are controlling the EE power domains with this binding.
each power domain has 1 bit in the HHI registers and 2 more bits
("sleep" and "isolation") in the AO region

then it makes sense to describe this together

agreed, this is the same for the 32-bit SoCs except that we manage the
CPU domains in arch/arm/mach-meson/platsmp.c instead of PSCI firmware
(no problem here, I'm just mentioning it to get a complete picture)

with your description above I agree.

for the 32-bit SoCs it would be beneficial if the register layout in
the bindings was swapped:
- have the power controller as child of HHI
- pass the AO syscon

my main points for this are:
- it seems that for some power domains there are no AO register bits,
for example the Ethernet Memory PD (GXBB datasheet [0] section 18.3 on
page 48 and Meson8b datasheet [1] section 5.4 on page 17)
- less confusion: if it's a power domain controller for the EE region
then it should be located there, even if it has additional bits
elsewhere
- (weakest argument though) on the 32-bit SoCs we currently don't have
a "big AO syscon" (and I don't see that we actually need it), but we
do have a "amlogic,meson8b-pmu", "syscon" binding which covers
AO_RTI_GEN_PWR_SLEEP0 (I should probably extend it so it covers
AO_RTI_GEN_PWR_ISO0 as well, that just extra 4 bytes)

What do you think?
