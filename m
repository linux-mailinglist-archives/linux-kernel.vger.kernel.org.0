Changes in v8:
- Address Stephen's comments on changes 2 and 3
- Add Reviewed by from Stephen on change 1

Changes in v7:
- Address Srinivas's comments to update commit text
- Add Reviewed by from Srinivas

Changes in v6:
- Drop 1 & 2 changes from v5 as they already landed in maintainer tree
- Drop 3 & 4 changes from v5 as no user at present for power domain in rsc
- Rename subject to appropriate since power domain changes are dropped
- Rebase other changes on top of next-20200221

Changes in v5:
- Add Rob's Acked by on dt-bindings change
- Drop firmware psci change
- Update cpuidle stats in dtsi to follow PC mode
- Include change to update dirty flag when data is updated from [4]
- Add change to invoke rpmh_flush when caches are dirty

Changes in v4:
- Add change to allow hierarchical topology in PC mode
- Drop hierarchical domain idle states converter from v3
- Address Merge sc7180 dtsi change to add low power modes

Changes in v3:
- Address Rob's comment on dt property value
- Address Stephen's comments on rpmh-rsc driver change
- Include sc7180 cpuidle low power mode changes from [1]
- Include hierarchical domain idle states converter change from [2]

Changes in v2:
- Add Stephen's Reviewed-By to the first three patches
- Addressed Stephen's comments on fourth patch
- Include changes to connect rpmh domain to cpuidle and genpds

Resource State Coordinator (RSC) is responsible for powering off/lowering
the requirements from CPU subsystem for the associated hardware like buses,
clocks, and regulators when all CPUs and cluster is powered down.

RSC power domain uses last-man activities provided by genpd framework based
on Ulf Hansoon's patch series[3], when the cluster of CPUs enter deepest
idle states. As a part of domain poweroff, RSC can lower resource state
requirements by flushing the cached sleep and wake state votes for various
resources.
