I was going to say that I should use ranges to limit the address cells
in addition to the size cells, but then I think I must have got
distracted and forgot to finish my

Yeah.  I'm a little scared to go and do this for every qcom device
tree file since I have no good way to test them, but I suppose I can
give it a shot.  I was kinda thinking that, in general, it would make
sense for folks to tackle one SoC at a time and make that SoC clean
and test it.

In any case, your idea about updating the example seemed wise to me,
so I sent out:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/20191216220512.1.I7dbd712cfe0bdf7b53d9ef9791072b7e9c6d3c33@changeid

I'll put this patch on hold until Rob gives his thoughts on that one
so we can really make sure we're supposed to be using ranges in this
way.
