The change in the patch keeps the existing functionality in the

qcom mdt_loader by reading the full file using the enhanced api.

I don't know when Bjorn will switch to use the partial firmware load:

We can kill the older api right now as my patch in qcom mdt_loader

calls the new API which allows reading of full or partial files?

I have switched the single user of the existing api to the new

API in the patch already?  And both full and partial reads using

the new API are tested with this patch series.  If you really insist

on keeping the old API for a single user I can drop that change from the

patch series and have the old request_firmware_api call simply

be a wrapper calling the new API.

We can skip right now then.  As enhanced API is a superset of old API.

If you want the old API left in place I can just add the wrapper 
described and

only test the newly named function and thus indirectly test the old

request_firmware_into_buf.
