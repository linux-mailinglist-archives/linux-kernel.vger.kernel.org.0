I understand that RT tasks run on BIG cores by default when uclamp is enabled.
Can you tell what happens when we have more runnable RT tasks than the BIG
CPUs? Do they get packed on the BIG CPUs or eventually silver CPUs pull those
tasks? Since rt_task_fits_capacity() is considered during wakeup, push and
pull, the tasks may get packed on BIG forever. Is my understanding correct?

Also what happens for the case where RT tasks are pinned to silver but with
default uclamp value i.e p.uclamp.min=1024 ? They may all get queued on a
single silver and other silvers may not help since the task does not fit
there. In practice, we may not use this setup. Just wanted to know if this
behavior is intentional or not.

Thanks,
Pavan
