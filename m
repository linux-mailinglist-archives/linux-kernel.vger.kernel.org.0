Yes entry-method="psci" is required as per DT binding but not checked
in code on arm64. We have CPU ops with idle enabled only for "psci", so
there's not need to check.

Once we have DT schema validation, this will be caught, so it's better
to fix it.

From DT binding perspective, we can have different CPU enable-method
and CPU idle entry-method. However on arm64, it's restricted to PSCI
only. I need to check what happens on arm32 though, as the driver
invocation happens via CPUIDLE_METHOD_OF_DECLARE.

Indeed.

Why do you want to deprecated just because Linux kernel doesn't want to
use it. That's not a valid reason IMO.

Not on ARM64, but same DT bindings can be used for idle-states on
say RISC-V and have some value other than "psci".

Nope, I don't think so. But if it's causing issues, we can look into it.
I don't want to restrict the use of the bindings for ARM/ARM64 or psci only.
