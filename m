Looks like an ioctl() to me. But what need do we have to directly reset
the device? Could we achieve the same by rebinding the driver if
necessary? We should only need to reset it if the driver has bugs, or
is there some errata that we need to deal with? Userspace shouldn't
be handling that though?

Then when would we ever gain file_lock if in_progress was set? Shouldn't the current
client hold file_lock until we'd set in_progress to false, in which case we wouldn't
need to check in_progress if we now hold the lock?

> in_progress isn't protected at all,

Except it is, because you've acquired file_lock above before checking it (and
in_reset).

And why is in_progress written to under ctx->start_lock (which is not file_lock)
in aspeed_xdma_start() in the earlier patch if it's not protected?

> it's just better to lock

There's never a case of "it's just better to lock", as if it were optional. Either the
variable needs to be protected against concurrent access or it doesn't. If it does,
always access it under a consistent lock.

Yes, so what you're suggesting is that in_progress needs to be protected against
concurrent access, so needs to be accessed under a consistent lock. Though as
suggested above it might be enough to successfully acquire file_lock.

As far as I can see we have three events that we need to care about:

1. Submission of a DMA request
2. Completion of a DMA request
3. PCIe-driven reset

For 1, multiple concurrent submissions need to be serialised, so we need a
mutex with the semantics of file_lock as you've described above.

2 should only occur if we have an event of type 1 outstanding. If 1 is outstanding
then receiving 2 should cause the process that triggered 1 to wake and release
the mutex.

3 can happen at any time which results in two cases that we need to care about:

3a. DMA request in progress (i.e. 1 but have not yet seen corresponding 2)
3b. DMA idle (no request in progress)

Events of type 1 need to be serialised against 3. 2 won't occur after 3 until 1 has
occurred, so there's no need to consider it in the serialisation for 3.

In the case of 3a. we need to reset the device, then mark the current transfer failed,
then wake the associated process. The woken process will release the mutex and
allow any queued requests to proceed.

3b is much simpler, though we need to prevent events of type 1 concurrently
accessing the device while the reset is in progress. So we need a spinlock to cover
configuring the device.

So that's two locks - a mutex to serialise process-context access to the device, and
a spinlock to serialise interrupts with respect to process-context access. Currently
your implementation contains two mutexes (start_lock and file_lock) and two
spinlocks (client_lock and reset_lock), all with fairly hazy definitions.

Ah, yes. Thanks.
