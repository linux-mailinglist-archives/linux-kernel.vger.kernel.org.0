Hmm, I think I might misunderstand what the "emulate prefix"... that is not
a prefix which replace actual prefix, but just works like an escape sequence.
Thus the next instruction can have any x86 prefix, correct?

If so, this patch doesn't work. I have to add a new field in struct insn
like "insn.emulate_prefix_size" so that we can keep a room for the prefixes
for real instruction.

Thank you,
