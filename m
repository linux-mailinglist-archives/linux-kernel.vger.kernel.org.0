It needs that information somehow. It doesn't necessarily need to be a
flag in the uapi, it could be simply a bit of information attached to
the dma-buf.

Not sure whether you mean some kind of uapi dma-buf flag or something
internal, so not clear whether I should say yes or no.

There has been patches floating around to add a secure buffer heap (to
ion, or as a new stand-alone allocator). I'm assuming that secure
buffer mode is something that's at least somewhat standardized in the
arm world (so that all the gfx ip can share such a buffer). Hence a
standalone allocator that all drivers which want to support these
secure buffers on arm platforms can interface with sounds like a good
idea to me.

Ok, so definitely not a modifier then.
