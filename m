IRQ0 is a historical x86 nuisance. On x86 irq0 is still valid - it's the
legacy timer irq. I'd be happy to fix that up, but there are quite some
assumptions vs. the irq numbering of the x86 legacy interrupt numbers in
general. BIOS/ACPI has them hard coded as well, so it's not entirely
trivial to fix that up.

For everything else than x86 (and maybe ia64( irq 0 should not exist and DT
based irq enumeration treated it as invalid interrupt number forever.

Though there were some old ARM subarchs which used to have hardcoded legacy
interrupt numbers including 0 as well.

Yeah. It makes the code fall through when ret == 0 so it can try the other
methods. What a mess...

That one translates irq0 into an error code.

Kinda both.

One way to solve it would be to change the '0' return value from the core
functions (irqdomain) to -EINVAL or such, but that needs some thorough
analysis whether there is valid irq 0 usage outside of x86/ia64.
