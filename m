I'm almost sure that there are no such cases at the moment. However,
from a maintainability standpoint, I'm still very twitchy about this
change; the current API encapsulates the RCU weirdness in the standard
helper functions, but with your proposal, suddenly taking f_cred from
somewhere and using it as a new task's subjective creds, or something
like that, would be unsafe.
