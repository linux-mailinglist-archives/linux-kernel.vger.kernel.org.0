I have the same gut feeling as you.

Then I have another question, why in page fault routines, we don't use
pmd_read_atomic() to retrieve pmd value? Since we support concurrent page
fault, and we just grap mmap_sem read-locked during page fault, the value
could be corrupted too.

For example in __handle_mm_fault()

	pmd_t orig_pmd = *vmf.pmd;
	barrier();

This is why the barrier() is here?

The following change looks good to me.
