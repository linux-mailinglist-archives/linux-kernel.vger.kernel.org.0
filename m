I'm totally file with installing the system via SSH, using a temporary
SSH key. I do make a strong distinction between the installation phase
and the final deployment. The SSH key used *for installation* doesn't
need to the be same as the final one. And very often at the end of the
installation we'll have produced enough entropy to produce a correct
key.

It's not because people got used to doing things the wrong way by
ignorance of how randomness works and raised this to an industrial
level that they must not adapt a little bit. If they insist on producing
an SSH key immediately at boot, you can be sure that many of those that
never fail are probably bad because they probably used some of the
tricks mentioned in this thread (like the fairly common mknod trick
that can make sense in a temporary system installation image) :-/

I maintain that we don't need the same amount of entropy to run a
regular system and to create a new key, and that as such it is not
a reasonable thing to do to create such a key as the first action.
I'm not saying that doing things correctly is as easy, but it's not
impossible at all: many of us have already used systems which use
something like dropbear with temporary key on the install image but
run off openssh in the final system image.

And even when booting off a pre-configured final image we could
easily imagine that the ssh service detects lack of entropy and
runs with a temporary key that is not saved, and in the background
starts a process trying to produce a final key for later use.
