Other than converting the bindings to .yaml not much changed from the 
previous post.
I will log the per patch changes in next post.

Ok. Will do it in next post.
  Why is max items 2? Isn't it 4?
Correct. It should be 4. I will correct it.
Is this property

The interrupts are used by many of the PMIC devices. I think better to 
mention it.
