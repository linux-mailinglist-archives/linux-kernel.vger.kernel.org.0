Unfortunately, I don't think this is what is conveyed to the end users.
Let's see what do we have documented:

Neither Qemu user documentation
(https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/qemu-doc.html) nor online help:
qemu-system-s390x -device virtio-net-ccw,?|grep iommu
  iommu_platform=3D<bool>  - on/off (default: false)
has any documentation on it.

But libvirt does have have documenttion on the knob that contros
iommu_platform for QEMU (when  QEMU is managed by libvirt):
"""
Virtio-related options=20

QEMU's virtio devices have some attributes related to the virtio
transport under the driver element: The iommu attribute enables the use
of emulated IOMMU by the device. The attribute ats controls the Address
Translation Service support for PCIe devices. This is needed to make use
of IOTLB support (see IOMMU device). Possible values are on or off.
Since 3.5.0=20
"""
(https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsVirtio)

Thus it seems the only available documentation says that it "enables the use
of emulated IOMMU by the device".

And for vhost-user we have
"""
When the ``VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM`` feature has not been negotiated:

* Guest addresses map to the vhost memory region containing that guest
  address.

When the ``VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM`` feature has been negotiated:

* Guest addresses are also called I/O virtual addresses (IOVAs).  They are
  translated to user addresses via the IOTLB.
"""

Nod.

>=20

Yes, the name in the spec is more neutral.

>=20

I could, and the I could also ask the libvirt guys to change <driver
iommu=3D'X'> to <driver access_platform=3D'X'> or similar and to change
their documentation to something that is harder to comprehend. Although
I'm not sure they would like the idea.

Yeah, it should not, in theory, but currently it does in practice.
Currently vhost will try to do the IOTLB dance (Jason has a patch that
should help with that), and we get the 'use dma api' side effects in the
guest (e.g. virtqueue's data go <2G + some overhead).

>=20

Right ACCESS_PLATFORM is a funny feature where the device refuses to
work if the driver does not ack.

>=20

Jason found a nice way to differentiate between needs translation and
does not need translation. But that patch still requires the ack by the
driver (and as Michael has pointed out we have to consider migration).

I'm afraid that  F_IOMMU_PLATFORM means different things in different
contexts, and that this ain't sufficiently documented. I'm tempted to do
a proper write-up on this (let's hope my motivation will and my time
will allow). I would also very much like to have Conny's opinion on this.

Halil
