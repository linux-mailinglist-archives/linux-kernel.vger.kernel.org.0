Yeah, the trick is simply that we don't expect another IRQ being
signaled via sdio_signal_irq(), until the ->ack_sdio_irq() has been
invoked.

And even if that happens, the works case scenario would be that we
would skip the 1-func optimized pat and end up reading the poll
CCCR_INTx. This should be fine.
