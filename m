Hi James,

Thanks for reviewing.

We already merged the equivalent nodes for RTD129x into arm-soc.git.
No Realtek review was received back when it was posted [1], sadly.

How does your reset controller differ from DesignWare, and how would you
prefer to handle it?

a) Do you want to send patches for a new Realtek-specific dt-binding [2]
and extend reset-simple driver to cover it as a copy&paste of the
DesignWare of_device_id?

b) Do you believe you need to submit a completely new reset driver?

An issue I had raised twice [4, 1] was that reset-simple only allows for
contiguous registers and thus couldn't handle the gap between reset3 and
reset4 on RTD1295, forcing me to use per-register nodes for consistency.
I am against modeling RTD1195 differently from RTD1295+, assuming
they're the equivalent IP, so we need a solution that works for both.
Philipp did indicate in [4] we could extend reset-simple for this gap
"if the implementation could be kept reasonably simple".

With v5.4-rc8 already tagged, please hurry if you want a different
binding in v5.5.

Regards,
Andreas
