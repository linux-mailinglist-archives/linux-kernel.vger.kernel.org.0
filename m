Apparently, I was not clear enough so I'll rephrase

No it is not done yet. Please check the code.

The reparenting of orphan is done only on clock registration, not on
provider registeration. Now that clocks can be specified by DT, this
probably needs to added.

That is your problem.

Please fix the underlying issue, then you can post your series again.

Please stop bringing the topic of "fw_name" and "name" field together, I
told you 3 times why this is wrong. It is not going to change.

It fails because the provider is not registered when you try to reparent
the orphan.

It shows that you should try again once the provider is registered.
