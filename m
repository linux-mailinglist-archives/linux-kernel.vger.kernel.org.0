Right, AFAICT the cpuset.cpu_exclusive thing doesn't actually impact the
sched_domains, only how CPUs can be allocated to cpusets. The important
bits are:

- the CPUs spanned by the cpuset
- Whether we have cpuset.sched_load_balance

Indeed, I was only considering the case with root.sched_load_balance=0
and the siblings would have cpuset.sched_load_balance=1, in which case
we get separate root domains. If !root cpusets have
sched_load_balance=0, related CPUs will only get the NULL domain
attached to them.

The sysctl interface would've been the last possible modifier.

Your comments make me realize that changelog isn't great, what about the
following?

---

The SD_LOAD_BALANCE flag is set unconditionally for all domains in
sd_init(). By making the sched_domain->flags syctl interface read-only, we
have removed the last piece of code that could clear that flag - as such,
it will now be always present. Rather than to keep carrying it along, we
can work towards getting rid of it entirely.

cpusets don't need it because they can make CPUs be attached to the NULL
domain (e.g. cpuset with sched_load_balance=0), or to a partitionned
root_domain, i.e. a sched_domain hierarchy that doesn't span the entire
system (e.g. root cpuset with sched_load_balance=0 and sibling cpusets with
sched_load_balance=1).

isolcpus apply the same "trick": isolated CPUs are explicitly taken out of
the sched_domain rebuild (using housekeeping_cpumask()), so they get the
NULL domain treatment as well.

Remove the checks against SD_LOAD_BALANCE.
