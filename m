Subject: [PATCH v1] KVM: x86/mmu: Prepare kvm_is_mmio_pfn() for PG_reserved
 changes

Right now, ZONE_DEVICE memory is always set PG_reserved. We want to
change that in the future.

KVM has this weird use case that you can map anything from /dev/mem
into the guest. pfn_valid() is not a reliable check whether the memmap
was initialized and can be touched. pfn_to_online_page() makes sure
that we have an initialized memmap - however, there is no reliable and
fast check to detect memmaps that were initialized and are ZONE_DEVICE.

Let's rewrite kvm_is_mmio_pfn() so we really only touch initialized
memmaps that are guaranteed to not contain garbage. Make sure that
RAM without a memmap is still not detected as MMIO and that ZONE_DEVICE
that is not UC/UC-/WC is not detected as MMIO.

Switching to pfn_to_online_page() keeps the existing behavior for
PFNs without a memmap and for ZONE_DEVICE memory. They are treated as
reserved and the page is not touched (e.g., to set it dirty or accessed).

I'd like to note that the pfn_valid() check in __kvm_map_gfn() is also bogu=
s,
but switching pfn_to_online_page() is not possible, as we would treat
ZONE_DEVICE memory differently then.
