This is a not-so-common situation, that can happen with periodic tasks
(a-la rt-app) blocking on clock_nanosleep() (or similar) after
executing for an amount of time comparable with the SCHED_DEADLINE
runtime.

It might happen that the task consumed a little bit more than the
remaining runtime (but has not been throttled yet, because the
accounting happens at every tick)... So, when dequeue_task_dl() invokes
update_task_dl() the runtime becomes negative and the task is throttled.

This happens infrequently, but if you try rt-app tasksets with multiple
tasks and execution times near to the runtime you will see it
happening, sooner or later.

Sorry, I missed part of the previous discussion, so maybe I am missing
something... But I suspect this "return" might be wrong (you risk to
miss a call to task_non_contending(), coming later in this function).

Maybe you cound use
	if (!p->dl_throttled)
		__dequeue_task_dl(rq, p)

Or did I misunderstand something?
