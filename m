I believe you are on the right track.  In short, it would be great if
the kernel would automatically dump out the needed information when
cpu_stopper gets stalled, sort of like RCU does (much of the time,
anyway) in its CPU stall warnings.  Given a patch that did this, I would
be quite happy to help advocate for it!
