That code can finish 5h after boot, it's entirely fine with this
specific usecase.

Again: we don't delay "the boot" for this. We just delay "writing a
new seed to disk" for this. And if that is 5h later, then that's
totally fine, because in the meantime it's just one bg process more that
hangs around waiting to do what it needs to do.
