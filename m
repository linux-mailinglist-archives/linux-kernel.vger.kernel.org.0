If qemu could punch hole (this is how qemu free file-backed memory) in 
THP unit, either w/ or w/o the patch the THP won't get split since the 
whole THP will get truncated. But, if qemu has to free memory in sub-THP 
size due to whatever reason (for example, 1MB for every 2MB section), 
then we have to split THP otherwise no memory will be freed actually 
with the current code. It is not about performance, it is about really 
giving memory back to host.
