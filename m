I'm supposed (just my guess) such restriction should just apply for the 
first allocation. Just like memcg charge, who does it first, whose 
policy gets applied.

Not only cpuset, but get_vma_policy() also needs find task_struct from 
vma. Currently, get_vma_policy() just uses "current", so it just returns 
the current process's mempolicy if the vma doesn't have mempolicy. For 
the node migrate case, "current" is definitely not correct.

It looks there is not an easy way to workaround it unless we claim node 
migrate is not compatible with both cpusets and mempolicy.
