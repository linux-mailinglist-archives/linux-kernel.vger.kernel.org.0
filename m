So that's the v4.0 version of VPENDBASER. On v4.0, you start by clearing
Valid, not changing any other bit. Subsequent polling of the leads to
the PendingLast bit once Dirty clears. The current code follows this
principle.

v4.1 changes the way VPENDBASER works in a number of way. Clearing Valid 
allows
a "handshake": At the point of making the vPE non-resident, to specify 
the
expected behaviour of the redistributor once the residency has been 
completed.
This includes requesting the doorbell or telling the GIC that we don't 
care to
know about PendingLast.

This is effectively a relaxation of the v4.0 behaviour. I believe the 
current
state of the driver matches both specs (not using common code though).

Thanks,
