commit f42c85e74faa422cf0bc747ed808681145448f88 moved tracepoint's ftrace
creation into include/trace/ftrace.h and trace/define_trace.h was deleted
as a result. However some comment info does not adapt to the change, which
is such a misguiding when reading related code.

This patch fix this by moving trace/trace_events.h to <trace/events/XXX.h>,
since tracepoint headers have already been moved to tarce/events/.
