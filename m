Hi Paul,

KASAN has its own string operations(memcpy/memmove/memset) because it needs to
hook some code to check memory region. It would undefined the original string
operations and called the string operations with the prefix '__'. But the
generic string operations didn't declare with the prefix. Other archs with
KASAN support like arm64 and xtensa all have their own string operations and
defined with the prefix.

Nick
