Hi, Bobby,

Thanks for playing with the branch!

Yes, this should be needed if you have 7d0325749a6c ("userfaultfd:
untag user pointers", 2019-09-25) in your base branch where the
address is replaced by its pointer.

Just FYI that there's some other tests/libraries over there [1,2].
Also the series has the uffd selftest for write-protection as well.

Thanks for the tag!  Yes it would be great if we can continue to work
on those, but for now let's see whether we can move on what we have
first (it's already two series without much certainty on whether it
could get merged soon).  Considering that we've got quite a few pings
again for either the mm retry series and the write-protect work, I'll
rebase the two series, test & post soon this week.  I'll keep you in
the loop.

Thanks,
