This is an atomic allocation and failing that one is not a problem
usually. High atomic reservations might prevent GFP_NOWAIT allocation
from suceeding but I do not see that as a problem. This is the primary
purpose of the reservation.

But you are stealing from the atomic reserves and thus defeating the
purpose of it.
