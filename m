"Trusted Keys use a TPM both to generate and to seal the keys. Keys
are sealed under a 2048 bit RSA key in the TPM, ..."

Trusted keys are not TPM keys.  They are not stored in the TPM.

Right, they need to be re-loaded on boot.  Refer to the dracut
module /modules.d/97masterkey for loading a trusted key during boot.

Trusted keys are not stored in the TPM.  Refer to the ima-evm-utils
README for examples of creating a trusted key (kmk) and an encrypted
key (evm-key).

The hex ascii encoded trusted key is sealed under the TPM SRK.
