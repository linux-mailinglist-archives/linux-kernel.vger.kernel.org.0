No devs would be bound to the i3cdev driver by default, it would have
to be done explicitly through a sysfs knob. Which makes me realize
we can't use the generic bind knob since it doesn't let the subsystem
know that it's a manual bind. I thought there was a way to distinguish
between manual and auto-bind.

I don't have a strong opinion on that one, though I find it a bit
easier to follow when the number of xfers is encoded in a separate
struct rather than extracted from the data size passed through the cmd
argument.

Why start from 0x30? It doesn't make sense to me. Just because you base
your code on something that already exists doesn't mean you have to
copy all of it.
