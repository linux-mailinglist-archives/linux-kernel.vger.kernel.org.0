 that such things are not necessary. With the "GNU" brainwashed putting 10m=

really referring the hacking sound of a typewriter, rather than any maniac =
GNU LSD version. To not speak of the horrible pointer variables in LADSPA. =
Did Linux even come much beyond Soundblaster mindset of the early 90s? Here=
 the BSD based Mac OS, has modern hardware and Logic Audio - a fully profes=
sional platform used by actual artists, rather than "noisebient artists" in=
 Linux crowds.

 In CBM days, expertise seemed more typical also, and LKML debates claim to=
 be this. Why not just take BSD further. With "cyberspace" indeed could nee=
