I have reviews on patches from years ago that I still haven't replied to ;)

Either:
1) SVA only in the first series, second series can do other options.
2) Patch N for SVA only, N+1... for other features.

I don't mind which, but I want to be able to see just one case and

Isn't that a bug in the device driver?
