Right, although I think behaviours could still be exported but via a
different and configurable interface, using thresholds.

Either at compile time or via procfs maybe we can expose and properly
document what happen in the scheduler if/when a task has a "latency
niceness" crossing a given threshold.

For example, by setting something like:

   /proc/sys/kernel/sched_cfs_latency_idle = 1000

we state that the task is going to be scheduled according to the
SCHED_IDLE policy.

  ( ( (tomatoes target here) ) )

Not sure also if we wanna commit to user-space APIs how we internally
map/translate a "latency niceness" value into a scheduler behaviour
bias. Maybe better not at least at the very beginning.

Best,
Patrick
