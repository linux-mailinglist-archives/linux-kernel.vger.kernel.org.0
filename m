so, "read (reloc)" also means boot loader can't write it, right?

Please bear my verbiage, see protocol explanation for "(reloc)":

"Boot loaders who want to load the kernel at a nonstandard address
should fill in the fields marked (reloc);"

Doesn't the explanation means: if boot loaders want to relocate the
kernel, they should write pref_address?

And while pref_address actually just provide a suggestion to boot
loader, loader could take it or not as you said, but won't write it.
That is why I choose the word "consult with" instead of "fill in".
