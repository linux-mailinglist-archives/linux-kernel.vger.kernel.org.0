It seems we could use __get_user_pages_locked() for that in
populate_vma_page_range() if we were guaranteed that mm stays alive.  This
is guaranteed for current->mm cases but there seem to be some callers to
populate_vma_page_range() where mm could indeed go away once we drop
mmap_sem. These luckily pass NULL for the 'nonblocking' parameter though so
all call sites seem to be fine but it would be fragile...

That may be a slight suboptimality with Josef's patches. If the page
is marked as PageReadahead, we always drop mmap_sem if we can and start
readahead without checking whether that makes sense or not in
do_async_mmap_readahead(). OTOH page_cache_async_readahead() then clears
PageReadahead so the only way how I can see we could loop like this is when
file->ra->ra_pages is 0. Not sure if that's what's happening through. We'd
need to find which of the paths in filemap_fault() calls
maybe_unlock_mmap_for_io() to tell more.
