I will change the data block ID size to "unsigned long". Then it is
really only an issue for 32-bit systems.

AFAICT, the only real issue is that the head can be pushed to the
descriptor index that the tail is pointing to. From there, the head can
be advanced beyond and the tail may never move again. So writers just
need to make sure the tail gets pushed beyond the newly reserved head
before making any changes to that descriptor.

Aside from moving to "unsigned long" ID's, I believe this can be handled
with the following 4 changes when reserving a new descriptor:

- also push the tail forward if it falls behind

- after pushing the head, re-check if the tail is still ok

- verify the state of the reserved descriptor before changing it

- use cmpxchg() to change it

Below is the patch snippet I use for this. (Note that the patch is
against a version where ID's have already been changed to unsigned
longs.)
