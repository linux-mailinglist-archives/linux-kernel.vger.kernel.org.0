Since "[PATCH] printk: Monitor change of console loglevel." is one time (only
needed until we find the reason of silence), testing on only linux-next.git
is sufficient and it gets enabled on with CONFIG_DEBUG_AID_FOR_SYZBOT.

syzbot tests not only linux-next.git but also various trees, and tests
attempted depends on target git tree. Therefore, apart from whether we
can introduce a kernel config option for fuzzing testing,
"[PATCH] kernel/hung_task.c: Monitor killed tasks." is expected to be
in linux.git. This patch will eventually become upstream candidate.
