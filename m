First off, thanks for looking into this :-)

In add_memory_resource(), we have a call to mhp_check_correct_flags(), which is
in charge of checking if the flags passed are compliant with our configuration
among other things.
It also checks if both flags were passed (_MEMBLOCK|_DEVICE).

If a) any of the flags were specified and we are not on CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP,
b) the flags are colliding with each other or c) the flags just do not make sense,
we print out a warning and drop the flags to 0, so we just ignore them.

I just realized that I can adjust the check even more (something for the next
version).

But to answer your question, flags are ignored under !CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.

Yes, on SPARSEMEM we first try to allocate the pages physical configuous, and
then fallback to vmalloc.
This is because on CONFIG_SPARSEMEM memory model, the translations pfn_to_page/
page_to_pfn do not expect the memory to be contiguous.

But that is not the case on CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.
We do expect the memory to be physical contigous there, that is why a simply
pfn_to_page/page_to_pfn is a matter of adding/substracting vmemmap/pfn.

Powerpc code is at:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.2-rc6/source/arch/powerpc/mm/init_64.c#L175

No, MHP_MEMMAP_DEVICE is meant to be used when hot-adding and hot-removing work
in the same granularity.
This is because all memmap pages will be stored at the beginning of the memory
range.
Allowing hot-removing in a different granularity on MHP_MEMMAP_DEVICE would imply
a lot of extra work.
For example, we would have to parse the vmemmap-head of the hot-removed range,
and punch a hole in there to clear the vmemmap pages, and then be very carefull
when deleting those pagetables.

So I followed Michal's advice, and I decided to let the caller specify if he
either wants to allocate per memory block or per hot-added range(device).
Where per memory block, allows us to do:

add_memory(1GB, MHP_MEMMAP_MEMBLOCK)
remove_memory(128MB)

Yap, 8GB will fill the first section with vmemmap pages.
It will be marked as online, yes.
This is not to diverge too much from what we have right now, and starting
treat some sections different than others.
E.g: Early sections that are used for memmap pages on early boot stage.

They are PG_Reserved.
Anyway, you mean by crash-tool?
