Yes, that is why we didn't do anything earlier with Dave's reports; we
couldn't reconcile the results with the code, and the lack of other
similar problem reports made me suspicious.  As you said, we
understand things a bit better now.

Understood.  FWIW, I'm not overly in love with the approach in the
patch you posted, but I haven't looked too seriously into alternatives
thus far.  I expect with most everyone running with the "never" audit
rule installed this solves this just fine for the time being.
