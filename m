We added fallback option for audio mclk and also added check for=20
assigned-clock-parents dt property in audio driver and if its not then=20
we do parent init configuration in audio driver.

Current clock driver creates 2 separate clocks clk_out_1_mux and=20
clk_out_1 for each pmc clock in clock driver and uses extern1 as parent=20
to clk_out_1_mux and clk_out_1_mux is parent to clk_out_1.

With change of registering each pmc clock as a single clock, when we do=20
parent init assignment in audio driver when assigned-clock-properties=20
are not used in DT (as we removed parent inits for extern and clk_outs=20
from clock driver), we should still try to get clock based on=20
clk_out_1_mux as parent assignment of extern1 is for clk_out_1_mux as=20
per existing clock tree.

clk_out_1_mux clock retrieve will fail with this change of single clock=20
when any new platform device tree doesn't specify assigned-clock-parents=20
properties and tegra_asoc_utils_init fails.

With single clock, extern1 is the parent for clk_out_1 and with separate=20
clocks for mux and gate, extern1 is the parent for clk_out_1_mux.
