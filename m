Currently, it is pages coming from tmpfs.  Ideally we want pages that
are swappable when unpinned.

CPU mappings are *mostly* just mapping to userspace.  There are a few
exceptions that are vmap'd (fbcon, and ringbuffer).

(Eventually I'd like to support pages passed in from userspace.. but
that is down the road.)

Tying it to iommu_map/unmap would be awkward, as we could need to
setup cpu mmap before it ends up mapped to iommu.  And the plan to
support per-process pagetables involved creating an iommu_domain per
userspace gl context.. some buffers would end up mapped into multiple
contexts/iommu_domains.

If the cache operation was detached from iommu_map/unmap, then it
would seem weird to be part of the iommu API.

I guess I'm not entirely sure what you had in mind, but this is why
iommu seemed to me like a bad fit.

If I only have to worry about aliased mappings that I create myself,
that doesn't seem too bad..  I could track that myself easily enough.
