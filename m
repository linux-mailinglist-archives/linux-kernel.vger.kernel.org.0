Thanks a lot for checking this one out! At least this proves now that
the only platform affected is in fact Intel Aero board, and the patch
as it is might not be necessary to accommodate for all CHT-based
products with Whiskey Cove.

I tend to lean to a solution to perform a DMI check in MFD rather than
in the regulator driver, since this would keep the regulator
more-or-less agnostic to the where it is running on.

Or maybe it would even make more sense to create a board-specific hook
(like it was suggested for vqmmc voltage and sdmmc ACPI d of
consumer), and then only register a cell for Aero match? This would
actually keep the regulator consumer and mfd cell together and would
not allow the device-specific code to leak into generic driver
implementation. In this case I'd go with mfd_add_cell() if I get a DMI
match and register a vqmmc consumer in there.

In that case, can you please tell me what you think about it and if
the drivers/acpi/acpi_lpss.c would still be an appropriate location to
put this code to?

Thanks a lot!
