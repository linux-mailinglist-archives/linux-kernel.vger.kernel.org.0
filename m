TBH, I would not mind sticking with it.
What sticked out the most was that in the previous check, we BUG_on while
here we just print out a warning, so it seemed quite "inconsistent" to me.

And I only stumbled upon this when I was testing a kernel module that
hot-removed memory in a different granularity.

Anyway, I do not really feel strong here, I can perfectly drop this patch as I
would rather have the focus in the following-up patches, which are the important
ones IMO.
