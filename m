Yes, currently where I am a bit stuck is the rcu_dereference_raw()
cannot possibly know what SRCU domain it is under, so lockdep cannot check if
an SRCU lock is held without the user also passing along the SRCU domain. I
am trying to change lockdep to see if it can check if *any* srcu domain lock
is held (regardless of which one) and complain if none are. This is at least
better than no check at all.

However, I think it gets tricky for mutexes. If you have something like:
mutex_lock(some_mutex);
p = rcu_dereference_raw(gp);
mutex_unlock(some_mutex);

This might be a perfectly valid invocation of _raw, however my checks (patch
is still cooking) trigger a lockdep warning becase _raw cannot know that this
is Ok. lockdep thinks it is not in a reader section. This then gets into the
territory of a new rcu_derference_raw_protected(gp, assert_held(some_mutex))
which sucks because its yet another API. To circumvent this issue, can we
just have callers of rcu_dereference_raw ensure that they call
rcu_read_lock() if they are protecting dereferences by a mutex? That would
make things a lot easier and also may be Ok since rcu_read_lock is quite
cheap.

Actually, the API name change is not something I want to do, it is Steven
suggestion. My suggestion is let us just delete _raw_notrace and just use the
_raw API for tracing, since _raw doesn't do any tracing anyway. Steve pointed
that _raw_notrace does sparse checking unlike _raw, but I think that isn't an
issue since _raw doesn't do such checking at the moment anyway.. (if possible
check my cover letter again for details/motivation of this series).

thanks!
