People will get used to the name more quickly than they will get used
to typing the extra seven characters.  Here is the current comment header:

/*
 * data_race(): macro to document that accesses in an expression may conflict with
 * other concurrent accesses resulting in data races, but the resulting
 * behaviour is deemed safe regardless.
 *
 * This macro *does not* affect normal code generation, but is a hint to tooling
 * that data races here should be ignored.
 */

I will be converting this to docbook form.

In addition, in the KCSAN documentation:

* KCSAN understands the ``data_race(expr)`` annotation, which tells KCSAN that
  any data races due to accesses in ``expr`` should be ignored and resulting
  behaviour when encountering a data race is deemed safe.

Fair enough?
