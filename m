Suppose that we had a variant of RCU that had about the same read-side
overhead as Preempt-RCU, but which could be used from idle as well as
from CPUs in the process of coming online or going offline?  I have not
thought through the irq/NMI/exception entry/exit cases, but I don't see
why that would be problem.

This would have explicit critical-section entry/exit code, so it would
not be any help for trampolines.

Would such a variant of RCU help?

Yeah, I know.  Just what the kernel doesn't need, yet another variant
of RCU...
