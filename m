It may be redundant, but I think it might be a preferred interface for
some users.  In any case, supporting 1) would just a simple matter of
providing a wrapper interface around your string interface.

Good suggestions - I'll start implementing something like this and
rebase my patches on top of this.

OK, yeah I guess synth_event_run_command() et al are very simple.
