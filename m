Agreed as expressed in my other reply

Could you be more specific please? kspwad should stop as soon as the
high watermark is reached. If that is not the case then there is a bug
which should be fixed.

Sure it is quite possible that kswapd is busy for extended amount of
time if the memory pressure is continuous.

Again, do you have more details about the workload and what was the
cause of responsiveness issues? Because I would expect that the
situation would be quite opposite because it is usually the direct
reclaim that is a source of stalls visible from userspace. Or is this
about a single CPU situation where kswapd saturates the single CPU and
all other tasks are just not getting enough CPU cycles?

But still, somebody has to put the system into balanced state so who is
going to do all the work?
