That can never happen since aligning fb_size will never cross a page
boundary, and stolen_size is always on a page boundary. Not sure how
to explain it on a good way but:
If stolen_size = 4096, then fb_size is only more than stolen_size if
it is actually > 4096 regardless if we align it or not.

We can keep it if you think it makes the code more readable.

I was only thinking of the size alignment. Yes, ditching 2D would make
life easier in this regard.

Let's keep it as it is with the motivation that it increases readability.

Applied to drm-misc-next.
