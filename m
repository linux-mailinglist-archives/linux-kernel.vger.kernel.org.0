Then this where we have different views ont he matter. I think this makes the
logic a lot more complex.

A controller should *know* if a clock is coming from 'somewhere else' and how.
I think we should not try multiple methods hoping one will eventually work.

I has already caught us now and I'm willing to bet we won't be the last.

Sure ... but we are also suffering from the complexity of the logic behind this
(and the table above)

When I define .hw, I don't need to initialize the rest but when I define .name I
must define (at least) .index to a specific value ... This is at least tricky,
and IMO, inconsistent.

I'm sorry, I still find all this very confusing just to add a fallback
mechanism. It would be simpler to ask people to choose the method they.

The transition to DT can be done submitting DT part first and submitting the
clock driver part later on

Anyway, we'll define index to -1 since this how it is supposed to be. Thx for
your explanation
