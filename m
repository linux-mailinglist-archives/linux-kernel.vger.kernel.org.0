Ok, fair enough. We want to keep things hidden behind certain layers,
and that's definitely a good thing. But there is a problem with these
layers - they do not expose all the features. For example AFAIK there
is no clear way to use 512+8 format via block layer (nor even a way 
to get know that bdev is formatted to particular lbaf). It's impossible
to use it without layering violations, which nobody sees as a perfect
solution, but it is the only one that works.

I'm not going to insist on merging changes dedicated for out of tree
modules. I'd be happy to get involved in improving kernel support for 
NVMe so that there would be no need for that changes. What I proposed
is a quick fix for the problem that, for sure, can be solved another,
better way.

And this is not about being in tree or out of tree - a lot of out of
tree modules are doing well without any special care from the upstream.
This is about lack of support for certain features. If you have any
proposal how we should solve this problem in a better way than I
proposed in my humble patchset, I will gladly submit new patches.

Best regards,
Robert Baldyga
