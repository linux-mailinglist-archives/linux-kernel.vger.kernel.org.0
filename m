I could understand that you spend a lot of time on creating the
labels and that they are somehow useful for you.

But I am not using them and I hope that I will not have to:

  + Grepping takes a lot of time, especially over several files.

  + Grepping is actually not enough. It is required to read
    the following comment or code to realize what the label is for.

  + Several barriers have multiple dependencies. Grepping one
    label helps to check that one connection makes sense.
    But it is hard to keep all relations in head to confirm
    that they are complete and make sense overall.

  + There are about 50 labels in the code. "Entry Lifecycle"
    section in dataring.c talks about 8 step. One would
    expect that it would require 8 read and 8 write barriers.

    Even coordination of 16 barriers might be complicated to check.
    Where 50 is just scary.


  + It seems to be a newly invented format and it is not documented.
    I personally do not understand it completely, for example,
    the meaning of "RELEASE from jA->cD->hA to jB".


I hope that we could do better. I believe that human readable
comments all less error prone because they describe the intention.
Pseudo code based on labels just describes the code but it
does not explain why it was done this way.

From my POV, the labels do more harm than good. The code gets
too scattered and is harder to follow.


> I hope that we can agree that the labels are important.

It would be great to hear from others.

> And that a formal documentation of the barriers is also important.

It might be helpful if it can be somehow feed to a tool that would
prove correctness. Is this the case?

In each case, it should follow some "widely" used format.
We should not invent a new one that nobody else would use
and understand.

The dataring_push is clear. The A or B codes have no meaning
without searching.

It might look better if we replace A or B with variable names.

Is this some known syntax, please? I do not understand it.

It depends on the type of the information. I would describe:

  + The overall design on top of the source file or in
    Documentation/...

  + The behavior of externally used API and non-obvious functions
    above the function definition.

  + Implementation details, non-obvious effects, side effects,
    relations, meaning of tricky calculation, meaning of
    a block of code inside the code. But each function should
    ideally fit on the screen.

I personally tend to write more documentation but it is sometimes
too much. I am trying to become more effective and to the point.

Petr
