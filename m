Hi Heiko,

thanks for the review. I'll implement the changes and send a v2.

I see why this is looking weird. It does not make a whole lot of sense
at the moment and I'll change that for v2.Â 

However I have a patch in the making that adds "-inverted" variants for
all triggers so the power LED can be turned of briefly to indicate mmc
activity.

Not sure wether people will like it or not but I'll try it as a RFC.

The issue is that some users wanted to be able to control the wakeup
functionality of the keys separately via sysfs. That does not seem to be
possible when combining both keys into one gpio-keys node. A more
detailed explanation of the issue can be found at [1].

This does likely come from the BSP dts. Seems I missed it while checking
bindings.


Thanks again for the review,

Tobias
