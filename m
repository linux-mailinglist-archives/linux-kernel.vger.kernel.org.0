One thing I have an issue with the current approach is the use of the
trace file for this.

Hmm, what about adding a notifier to tracing_max_latency instead? And
do it not as a config option, but have it always enabled. It would send a
notification when it changes, and that only happens when there's a new
max latency. Would that work for you?
