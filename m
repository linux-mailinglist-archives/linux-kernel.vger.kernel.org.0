Good question. Shi and me aligned today. Also talked with Mel (but
sorry I must missed some points due to poor English listening). It
becomes clear that

1) PMEM/DRAM page promotion/demotion is a hard problem to attack.
There will and should be multiple approaches for open discussion
before settling down. The criteria might be balanced complexity,
overheads, performance, etc.

2) We need a lot more data to lay solid foundation for effective
discussions. Testing will be a rather time consuming part for
contributor. We'll need to work together to create a number of
benchmarks that can well exercise the kernel promotion/demotion paths
and gather the necessary numbers. By collaborating on a common set of
tests, we can not only amortize efforts, but also compare different
approaches or compare v1/v2/... of the same approach conveniently.

Ying has already created several LKP test cases for that purpose.
Shi and me plan to join the efforts, too.

Thanks,
Fengguang
