Right, reworded.

Fixed the indentation.

Ooh. I incorrectly assumed that a minus sign would be part of the
number literal and wouldn't be allowed for unsigned types, and didn't
realize that -1UL is just -(1UL)... thanks, will adjust.

Yeah... I remember changing that as well as the comment above, I think
I lost the overview and accidentally went back to an earlier version
of the commit at some point... adjusted, thanks.

Okay, I'll bump up the level of hedging for canonical addresses to "maybe".

The part about 32-bit makes sense to me; I've limited the
CONFIG_X86_64 ifdeffery to the computation of *non_canonical.

I don't really like plumbing the error code down to the helper just so
that it can return an enum value to us based on that; but I guess the
rest of it does make the code a bit more pretty, will adjust.

And there also is nothing in the instruction decoder that could ever
set opnd_bytes to 1, AFAICS. So while I think that the inaccuracies
there don't really matter for the coarse "is it noncanonical #GP?"
distinction right now - especially considering that userland isn't
allowed to allocate the last canonical virtual page on X86-64 -, it
definitely isn't accurate enough to explicitly print the access size
or end address.
