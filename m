The underlying issue is that about 99% of MFD children should not be 
going through dma_configure() at all because their parent 'real' device 
is not on a DMA-capable bus, but as they are platform devices we are 
forced to give them the benefit of the doubt. For DT systems the only 
vaguely-reasonable heuristic to distinguish between "platform" meaning 
"SoC memory-mapped device" and "platform" meaning "random crap made up 
by Linux" is whether the device has a populated OF node, but MFD's trick 
of hanging the parent device's OF node onto its synthesised children 
kicks a hole right through even that.

Modulo any other concerns with the existing code, does the change below 
make things work the way you want? It's still a bit of a bodge, but 
short of invasive large-scale changes with bus types I don't see a way 
to do the 'right' thing :/

Robin.
