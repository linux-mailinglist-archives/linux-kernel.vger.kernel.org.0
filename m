FWIW test_bit() is an "atomic" bitop (per atomic_bitops.txt), and
KCSAN treats it as such. On x86 arch_test_bit() is not instrumented,
and then in asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-non-atomic.h test_bit() is
instrumented with instrument_atomic_read(). So on x86, things should
already be fine for test_bit(). Not sure about other architectures.
