Hi Karol,

A lot of appreciation for your hard-work on this issue, but unfriendly
comments aren't necessary. At the time this was discussed with
hardware vendors and platform vendors and it worked for many systems
and benefit for many people buying these platforms. Last but not
least, I do appreciate better fixes and want to retire the hacks too.

I am going to notify hardware owners to test these patches on the
original intended systems, and will report whether there are
regressions.
