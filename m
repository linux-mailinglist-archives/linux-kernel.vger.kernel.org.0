Indeed, a more accurate emulation such as temporarily disabling
split-lock detection in the emulator would allow the guest to use split
lock access as a vehicle for DoS, but that's not what the commit message
says.  If it were only about polluting the kernel log, there's
printk_ratelimited for that.  (In fact, if we went for incorrect
emulation as in this patch, a rate-limited pr_warn would be a good idea).

It is much more convincing to say that since this is pretty much a
theoretical case, we can assume that it is only done with the purpose of
DoS-ing the host or something like that, and therefore we kill the guest.

Or perhaps it was there all the time in test silicon or something like
that...  That would be a very plausible reason for all the quirks behind it.
