Interesting. I went and looked at the kernel when your patch merged.
As far as I can tell, you shouldn't have needed to clear OF_POPULATED
because the timer framework never set OF_POPULATED even back then.

If this driver was based in drivers/irqchip/irq-ingenic-tcu.c and you
were initially just trying to get it to create a device, then you'd
have needed to clear OF_POPULATED because IRQ chip framework does set
the flag.

In any case, it's good that you cleared it -- it'll continue to work
with my patch.

Daniel,

Looks like this answers all the concerns you had. I also checked every
driver in drivers/clocksource that had the word "probe" in it to make
sure it won't need any updates to ingenic-timer.c. Can we merge this?

Thanks,
Saravana
