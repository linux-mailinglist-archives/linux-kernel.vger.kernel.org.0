Subject: [PATCH 26/34] Documentation/RCU: Use CONFIG_PREEMPTION where appropriate
Date:   Tue, 15 Oct 2019 21:18:13 +0200
Message-Id: <20191015191821.11479-27-bigeasy@linutronix.de>

The config option `CONFIG_PREEMPT' is used for the preemption model
"Low-Latency Desktop". The config option `CONFIG_PREEMPTION' is enabled
when kernel preemption is enabled which is true for the `CONFIG_PREEMPT'
and `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT' preemption models.

Use `CONFIG_PREEMPTION' if it applies to both preemption models and not
just to `CONFIG_PREEMPT'.
