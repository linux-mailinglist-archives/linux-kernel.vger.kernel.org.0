Pure trace events are frowned upon in scheduler world, try going with
trace points. Qais did something very similar recently:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190604111459.2862-1-qais.yousef@arm.com/

You'll have to implement the associated trace events in a module, which
lets you define your own event format and doesn't form an ABI :).
