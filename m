There's no driver sw required at all for our implementation and as far
as I know, HDCP 2.x requires that all of the key revoke handling be
handled in a secure processor rather than than on the host processor,
so I'm not sure how we make use if it.  All the driver sw is
responsible for doing is saving/restoring the potentially updated srm
at suspend/resume/etc.
