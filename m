AES keys are for symmetrical encryption and thus as such are short-lived.
We're back to what Linus was saying about the fact that our urandom is
already very good for such use cases, it should just not be used to
produce long-lived keys (i.e. asymmetrical).

However I'm worried regarding this precise patch about the fact that
delays will add up. I think that once we've failed to wait for a first
process, we've broken any hypothetical trust in terms of random quality
so there's no point continuing to wait for future requests.
