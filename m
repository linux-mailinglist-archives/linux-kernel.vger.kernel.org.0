Yes. This is what I needed to see.

Thank you. This is the level of formalization I've been looking for. I
will rework the comments (and naming) and post a v3. It is probably best
for you to wait until then to look at this again. (And after going
through such formal processes, even _I_ am having difficulties
understanding what some of my memory barriers are supposed to be
synchronizing.)
