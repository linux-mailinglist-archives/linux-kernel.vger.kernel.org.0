I will give you a definite "maybe".

Here are the two reasons for changing RCU's embarrassingly large array
of tuning parameters:

1.	They are causing a problem in production.  This would represent a
	bug that clearly must be fixed.  As you say, this change is not
	in this category.

2.	The change simplifies either RCU's code or the process of tuning
	RCU, but without degrading RCU's ability to run everywhere and
	without removing debugging tools.

The change below clearly simplifies things by removing a few lines of
code, and it does not change RCU's default self-configuration.  But are
we sure about the debugging aspect?  (Please keep in mind that many more
sites are willing to change boot parameters than are willing to patch
their kernels.)

What do you think?

Finally, I urge you to join with Joel Fernandes and go through these
grace-period-duration tuning parameters.  Once you guys get your heads
completely around all of them and how they interact across the different
possible RCU configurations, I bet that the two of you will have excellent
ideas for improvement.
