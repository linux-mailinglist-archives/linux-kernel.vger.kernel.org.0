Hi YanQing,

Thanks for the report - which board, branch and (base) tag are you
testing against? And are you building perf yourself from kernel sources,
or are you using some distro package?

I only have Busybox in my initrd on DS418; I have not tested perf.

Note that above rtd129x.dtsi snippet is not complete. See rtd1296.dtsi:

&arm_pmu {
	interrupt-affinity = <&cpu0>, <&cpu1>, <&cpu2>, <&cpu3>;
};

48 and high/4 match what I see in the latest BSP:

https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M4-bsp/blob/master/linux-rtk/arch/arm64/boot/dts/realtek/rtd129x/rtd-1296.dtsi#L116

The only difference I see is "arm,cortex-a53-pmu" vs. "arm,armv8-pmuv3".
By my reading of arch/arm64/kernel/perf_event.c the only difference
between the two should be the name and an extra cache_map. You could try
the other compatible string in your .dts, but I doubt it'll help.

Hopefully the Realtek or Arm guys can shed some light.

Regards,
Andreas
