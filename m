Reproduced on QEMU. CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is the trigger. Due to 
smp_processor_id() being called from early_init_this_mmu(), when 
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT is set debug_smp_processor_id() is called instead 
of raw_smp_processor_id(), but this is too early for 
debug_smp_processor_id()

As this call is useless, just drop it.

Can you test patch at https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1144005/ ?

Thanks
