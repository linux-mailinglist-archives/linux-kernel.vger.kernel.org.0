Hi Radim,


Why not try Chrome Tracing

1--Record trace data, scheduling, irq, etc.
     You can Produce a JSON file with the format expected by Chrome
     OR
     just save the captured data directly as "xxx.html", it can still work.
     cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace > trace.html
2--Go to chrome://tracing in Chrome,
3--Click "Load" and open your file, or alternatively drag the file into 
Chrome,
4--Profit!


Systrace (Android System Trace) captures and displays execution times of 
your app's
processes and other Android system processes, fortunately, there are 
some ported
versions for Linux Desktop/Server.
