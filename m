Thanks for the feedback. I have a couple concerns with a KVM
maintained blacklist. First, I'm worried it will be difficult to keep
such a list up to date and accurate (both coming up with the initial
list since there are so many events, and updating it whenever any new
events are published or vulnerabilities are discovered). Second, users
may want to differentiate between whole-socket and sub-socket VMs
(some events may be fine for the whole-socket case) - keeping a single
blacklist wouldn't allow for this. Let me know what you think. I'll
try implementing the other suggestions.
