Actually, there are. Perf tool that has record, stat and top modes could run with
CAP_SYS_PERFMON capability as mentioned below and provide system wide performance
data. Currently for that to work the tool needs to be granted with CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

CAP_SYS_PERFMON could be applied broadly, though, this patch set enables record
and stat mode use cases for system wide performance monitoring in kernel and
user modes.

Thanks,
Alexey
