FWIW, I want it because it creates a compile-time-verifiable API for a
non-trivial set of common string copying flaws.

CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE isn't able to handle these (yet?) because it's
examining the outer size of structures that hold char arrays. And even
if we built in the logic to deal with it correctly, it'd still split
the detection between compile time and run time.
