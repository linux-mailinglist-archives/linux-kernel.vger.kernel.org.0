Thanks a lot for your thoughts, it is really helpful.

One issue with interrupt affinities is, we have only 2 cores on many devices
(4 HTs).  If we assign 1 HT out of the 4 for receiving interrupts (at least
the ones we can control affinity off), then that means we have to devote that
core to running only 1 trusted task at a time, since one of the 2 HT is
designated for interrupts. That leaves us with only the other 2 HTs on the
other core for simultaneously running the 2 trusted tasks, thus reducing the
parallellism.

Thanks for raising the point about running interrupts and softirqs in process
context to solve these, turns out we do use threaded IRQs however not on most
interrupts.  We could consider threading as many IRQs (and softirqs) as
as possible and for the ones we cannot thread, may be we can code audit code and
assess the risk, possibly deferring processing of sensitivity data to
workqueue context. Perhaps we can also conditionally force a softirq into
process context say if we detect that the core has an untrusted task running
on the softirq HT's sibling, and if not let the softirq execute in softirq
context itself.

Thanks, Thomas!!
