This will be gone, once the driver is converted to 1channel per controller.

 of arm,func-ids to determine this (using of_property_count_elems_of_size()=
 in the driver)? Having both sounds redundant and brings up the question wh=

Sounds like we are in sync.

number.

I still think func-id can be done without. A client can always pass
the value as it knows what it expects. But I can live with it being
optional.

cheers!
