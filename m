Sure, but then the perf tool will need to be able to interpret all these 
custom PMU files, which has scalability issues.

Maybe this would work and I did consider it, but another concern is that 
the PMU drivers will have problems making available some 
implementation-specific identifier at all.

For example, the "caps" directory is a

I'm not sure how. The perf tool PMU event aliasing already takes a few 
certain steps to figure out which cpuid to use:

static char *perf_pmu__getcpuid(struct perf_pmu *pmu)
{
	char *cpuid;
	static bool printed;

	cpuid = getenv("PERF_CPUID");
	if (cpuid)
		cpuid = strdup(cpuid);
	if (!cpuid)
		cpuid = get_cpuid_str(pmu);
	if (!cpuid)
		return NULL;

	if (!printed) {
		pr_debug("Using CPUID %s\n", cpuid);
		printed = true;
	}
	return cpuid;
}

And this would be something similar - just read some sysfs file.

It's doesn't necessarily make things easier in this regard. But using a 
SoC ID is an alternative to checking the SMMU_ID or the kernel driver 
having to know that it was a MMU-600 at all.

OK, so some combination of changes would still be required for the SMMU 
PMCG, IORT, and SMMUv3 drivers.

These changes were included in my RFC.

No, in fact I would rather not rely on ACPI or DT at all.

The spec is in beta stage now.

And if it's not implemented, then simply the perf tool cannot make PMU 
aliases for those DDRC or similar PMUs (and we would find that the DDRC 
or similar JSON files for those platforms would not be added until it 
does support it).

As I said above, we could try to expand the PMU sysfs entries for this, 
but I have concerns on how we make some imp specific identifier or what 
this would look like.

Why not do away with ACPI/DT entirely

As constantly checking what the SoC ID means throughout system 
components does not scale.
