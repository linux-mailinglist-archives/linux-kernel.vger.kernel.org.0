I am definitely not in favour of that :(

The basic problem we have here is that some vendors are overriding
your VID/PIDs, and this is nasty. And I do not see any reasons why you
can't say: "well, we broke it, sorry, but we only support *our*
devices, not third party ones".

One thing that comes to my mind (probably not the best solution), is
to taint the kernel if you are facing a non genuine product. We do
that for nvidia, and basically, we can say: "well, supporting the
nvidia blob is done on a best effort case, and see with them directly
if you have an issue".
Tainting the kernel is a little bit rough, but maybe adding an info
message in the dmesg if you detect one of those can lead to a
situation were we can count on you for supporting the official
products, and you can get community support for the clones.

One last thing. Roderick, I am not sure if I mentioned that or not,
but I am heavily adding regression tests for HID in
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libevdev/hid-tools/
Given that hid-sony.ko seems to only use pure HID communication, it
should be easy enough to write regression tests for the devices, and
this way you can split up the QA in 2: automated and upstream tests
run by me for all devices handled by hid-sony, and your QA can focus
on the actual physical hardware, and ignore all of the clones.

Cheers,
Benjamin
