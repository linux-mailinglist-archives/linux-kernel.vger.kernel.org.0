This ambiguity spreads even further. Look at the name of #define below.
DP0 is by no means invalid. It's specific and has some optional 
registers, yes, but that's because of its engagement in BPT.

Given the fact SDW does not care about type of data being transported, 
even "AUDIO" seems misleading here. Though it's still better than no 
specifier at all.
