Oh, sorry, I copy-pasted wrong number. I meant 0x7fff8000. Here is the
user-space mapping that uses it:
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_mapping.h#L25

Then I would expect 0x1000 0000 0000 to work, but you say it doesn't...

This is something new, right? The previous stacks you posted did not
mention lockdep.

Ack.

Maybe if you dump /proc/self/maps for the process, it will shed some light.
Or is it possible to run it under strace? If we get all
mmap/munmap/mprotect, we will maybe see the offender that messes the
shadow...
