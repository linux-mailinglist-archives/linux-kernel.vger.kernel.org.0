What I need is some way for userspace to tell the driver parameters for the display refresh (driving waveforms, refresh speed etc.) on a frame-by-frame basis. These parameters depend on ambient temperature and the displayed content. One has to trade off speed, ghosting and the number of possible partial refreshes until next full one.

Since they're bistable, they can also only physically refresh part of the area though. The reason for not having that on-by-default is that epaper partial refresh is really tricky. If you refresh the same area partially a few times, charge builds up, image quality degrades and the picture starts bleeding. If you refresh the same area partially all the time and don't do enough full refresh cycles to balance charges again, eventually the display is going to get permanent burn-in. I think partial refresh should be supported by a driver like this since it's a good tool to alleviate the enormous full refresh times.

>> For partial hardware refresh you have to customize all these values and the waveform LUTs depending on the displayed content. For example you might want a LUT specifying more inversion cycles for text display to reduce ghosting, or one with less cycles but higher voltages for some spinning loading animation to reduce flickering. If you are displaying a loading bar you might be able to get away with a high drive strength since you know it's going to be done in a few frames, but if you display e.g. a text console you might want to reduce drive strength to do as many partial updates as possible before the next full refresh, to reduce flicker.

They basically contain a list of voltage levels a pixel transitioning white-black, white-red etc. should be driven at. The format seems to be standardized across different driver chips, but I'd really treat them as device-dependent binary blobs since for some chips they're not even specified and there's no guarantee the format won't suddenly change for some new chip.

I think I might remove this then, and instead have a timeout on updates. If userspace doesn't update for x hours, kernel forces a refresh. Then, userspace can still manage this if necessary with a full redraw.

I think my problem is I don't have a heuristic yet. I think you'd use something like [0] here. My issue putting that into kernel is that I don't understand it well enough to be confident this is all anybody would ever need.

I wouldn't know how to come up with safe boundaries for such checks. The vendor's datasheets are not much of a help. They basically say "don't deviate from our defaults for too long", but then there's others[1] who totally do deviate without a problem. The built-in hardware limits seem to be sensible. This patch configures both the b/w high drive voltage and the b/w/r low drive voltage to maximums (+/-11.0V) according to an example from the vendor, and it's working fine.

Maybe a way to go at this would be to have a set of parameter presets in dt along with limits (full refresh at least every x seconds, full refresh at least every x partial refreshes, etc.), and allow userspace to select one of these presets using a drm property? This way it can still be configured but and it doesn't need any ioctls.
