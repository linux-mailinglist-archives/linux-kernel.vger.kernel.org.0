Subject: [PATCH v6 0/7] perf diff: diff cycles at basic block level
Date:   Fri, 28 Jun 2019 17:22:57 +0800

In some cases small changes in hot loops can show big differences.
But it's difficult to identify these differences.

perf diff currently can only diff symbols (functions). We can also expand
it to diff cycles of individual programs blocks as reported by timed LBR.
This would allow to identify changes in specific code accurately.

With this patch set, for example,

 $ perf record -b ./div
 $ perf record -b ./div
 $ perf diff -c cycles

 '[Program Block Range]' indicates the range of program basic block
 (start -> end). If we can find the source line it prints the source
 line otherwise it prints the symbol+offset instead.

 v6:
 ---
 Remove the 'ops' argument in hists__add_entry_block. No functional change.

 Changed patches
  perf util: Add block_info in hist_entry 
  perf diff: Use hists to manage basic blocks per symbol

 v5:
 ---
 Only the patch 'perf diff: Use hists to manage basic blocks per symbol'
 is changed in v5. Since we still carry block_info in 'struct hist_entry'
 so we don't need our own new/free ops for hist entries. And the block_info
 is released in hist_entry__delete.

 v4:
 ---
 Use source lines or symbol+offset to indicate the basic block.

 Changed patches:
  perf diff: Print the basic block cycles diff
  perf diff: Documentation -c cycles option

 v3:
 ---
 In v3, the major change is to move most of block stuffs from
 'struct hist_entry' to new structure 'struct block_hist' and
 update the code accordingly. But we still have to keep the
 block_info in 'struct hist_entry' since we need to compare by
 block info when inserting new entry to hists.

 Others are minor changes, such as abs() -> labs(), removing
 duplicated ops and etc.

 Changed patches:
  perf diff: Use hists to manage basic blocks per symbol
  perf diff: Link same basic blocks among different data
  perf diff: Print the basic block cycles diff

 v2:
 ---
 Keep standard perf diff format.

 Following is the v1 output.
