Maybe in this discussion we can agree to use the common distinction 
between distributions and distribution build frameworks, where users of 
the latter need to be more technically sophisticated - as opposed to 
downloading a disk image.

I'm open to your concerns here.  Can you help me understand why adding a 
few lines to the kernel configuration fragments to disable the debug 
options creates maintenance pain?  Isn't it just a matter of adding a few 
lines to disable the debug options, and -- since you clearly don't want 
them enabled for any platform -- just leaving them in there?

After getting your response, I reviewed the OE-core tree that I have here, 
which is based on following the OE-core "getting started" instructions. 
The result is a tree with no RISC-V machine support.  Looking again at 
those instructions, I see that they check out the last release, rather 
than the current top of the tree; and the current top of tree does have a 
QEMU RISC-V machine.  So this statement of yours is correct, and I was in 
error about the current top-of-tree OE-core support.

> You talk later about misinformation but this is a blatent lie.

This isn't acceptable.  We've met each other in person, and I've 
considered you an enjoyable and trustworthy person to discuss technical 
issues with.  This is the first time that you've ever publicly accused me 
of misrepresenting an issue with intent to deceive.  There's a big 
difference between stating that someone is quoting misinformation and 
accusing someone of bad intentions.  I expect an apology from you.

You've already acknowledged in your response that the major Linux 
distributions don't use defconfigs.  So it's clear that your statement is 
false, and rather than admitting that you're wrong, you're doubling down.

For my part, I'd be happy if the current RISC-V OE and Buildroot users who 
don't change the kernel configs run with the defconfig debug options 
enabled right now.   So, I don't plan to send patches for them.

As stated earlier, I'm open to reconsidering if it indeed is onerous, and 
not just a matter of patching a few lines of kernel configuration 
fragments in OE and Buildroot once.
