I could make the EDAC driver (and others on the chain) check to see if
CEC already handled the error record:

		if (mce->handled & MCE_HANDLED_CEC)
			return NOTIFY_DONE;

Then everyone on the chain still sees the error ... just some of them
make informed decisions based on what functions earlier in the chain
did with the error record.

Ok. We don't have code that does this yet. If we need some, I'll
make sure to do the weed out before it gets to the notifier.
