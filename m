Yeah it does seem conceptually similar, good point.

Christian, pidfd_wait and expedited reclaim are both coordinated efforts and
solve different problems related to LMK. simple_lmk is entirely different
effort that we already hesitated about when it was first posted, now we
hesitate again due to the issues Suren and others mentioned.

I think it is a better idea for Sultan to spend his time on using/improving
PSI/LMKd than spending it on the simple_lmk. It could also be a good topic to
discuss in the Android track of the Linux plumbers conference.
