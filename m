I fixed that with a different approach. The following two patches are
queued for the next merge window:

d1874a0c2805 "s390/mm: make the pxd_offset functions more robust"
1a42010cdc26 "s390/mm: convert to the generic get_user_pages_fast code"

With these two s390 now uses the generic gup code in mm/gup.c
