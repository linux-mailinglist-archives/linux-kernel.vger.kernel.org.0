Ok, the message [2] is Linus' reaction on a similar patch.
He complained that

 (a) the ordering wasn't complete
 (b) this wasn't scripted.

In fact, parse-maintainers.pl was created to automatize such clean ups
and allow to fix all entries at once.

Fixing only VSPRITF record is a tiny-piece-by-piece approach.
It is an approach that will create a lot of work for many people.

If you want to do a clean up then please ask Linus to do it by the
script.

Also please add a check into checkpatch.pl to reduce regressions.

Best Regards,
Petr
