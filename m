Thanks for that.

If I read the trace correctly, the 5 tasks end up all being on the *all* the
big cores (ie: sharing), correct?

The results I posted did show that we can end up with 2 tasks on a single big
core. I don't think we can say this is a good or a bad thing, though for me
I see it a good thing since it honored a request to be on the big core which
the system tried its best to provide.

Maybe we do want to cater for a default all boosted RT tasks, is this what
you're saying? If yes, how do you propose the logic to look like? My thought is
to provide a real time knob to tune down most RT tasks to sensible default
dependong on how powerful (and power hungry) the system is, then use the per
task API to boost the few tasks that really need more performance out of the
system.

Note from my results assuming I didn't do anything stupid, if you boot with
a system that runs with rt_task->uclamp_min = 1024, then some will race to the
big cores and the rest will stay where they are on the littles.

In my first version things looked slightly different and I think handling of
the fallback not finding a fitting CPU was better.

Please have a look at and let me know what you think.
