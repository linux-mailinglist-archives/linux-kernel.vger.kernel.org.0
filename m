 From: Documentation/x86/topology.txt

"The kernel does not care about the concept of physical sockets because
a socket has no relevance to software. It's an electromechanical
component. In the past a socket always contained a single package
(see below), but with the advent of Multi Chip Modules (MCM) a socket
can hold more than one package. So there might be still references to
sockets in the code, but they are of historical nature and should be
cleaned up."

So that die thing has only small relevance to some software, as you say:

"These topology changes primarily impact parts of the kernel and some
applciations that care about package MSR scope."

So if there's no real need to add it there, then it probably shouldn't
be added. The topology is already too complex - so much so, that tools
are even generating PDFs from it :)
