I would love to see this happen. The biggest offenders should be gone. 
I really hated how those two locks have been conflated which likely
resulted in some undocumented/unintended dependencies. So for now, I
cannot really tell you whether the patch is correct. It would really
require a lot of testing. I am not sure this is reasonably reviewable.

So please add some testing results (ideally cpu hotplug racing a lot
with the memory hotplug). Then I would be willing to give this a try
and see. First by keeping it in linux-next for a release or two and then
eyes closed, fingers crossed and go to the wild. Do we have a tag for
that Dared-by maybe?
