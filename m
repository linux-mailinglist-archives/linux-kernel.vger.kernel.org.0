Odd.  It appears these two above should have the same serial number and
should be accompanied by a syscall record.  It appears that it has no
context to update to connect the two records.  Is it possible it is not
being called in a task context?  If that were the case though, I'd
expect audit_dummy_context() to return 1...

Checking audit_enabled should not be necessary but might fix the
problem, but still not explain why we're getting these records.
