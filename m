I will give that a go in next version!

Host controller is always parent of these devices which is represented 
in the example.

In my previous patches, i did put this slave bindings in bus.txt, but 
Vinod suggested to move it to slave.txt.

Are you suggesting to add two yamls here, one for slave and one for bus
Or just document this in one bus bindings?

In previous bindings ( https://lists.gt.net/linux/kernel/3403276 ) we 
did have instance-id as different property, however Pierre had some good 
suggestion to make it align with _ADR encoding as per MIPI DisCo spec.

Do you still think that we should split the instance id to reg property?
