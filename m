Right, but this is a sign that the reporter didn't read the wiki.
Explaining things like this encourages reporters to skip reading the
wiki and just send their report out.

But doesn't this just encourage mails being sent to linux-distros@
without the policies being followed? That was Alexander's concern at
least.

If it's an accepted preference then we should just document it in a few
other places like the linux-distros@ wiki. My concern with this is that
it's not, and it's actually one of the only things Alexander pointed out
in this document as surprising.
