Hi Frederic,

After more thought, it would share certain flags with nohz_full=, which
seemed confusing.

How about keeping the flags separate, and then on top of that do
an "unbound" flag (less typing needed).

This would allow users to combine the individual flags (again, useful
for debugging) while at the same time having an option which groups
all the others?
