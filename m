Another solution is to add the printk_deferred() in these places that
cause lockdep splats, and when John's work is done, it would be easy to
grep for them and remove them as they would no longer be needed.

This way we don't play whack-a-mole forever (only until we have a
proper solution) and everyone is happy that we no longer have these
false positive or I-don't-care lockdep splats which hide real lockdep
splats because lockdep shuts off as soon as it discovers its first
splat.
