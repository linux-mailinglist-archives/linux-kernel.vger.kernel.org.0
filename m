I see. I had followed the callchain several times, and always found new function.
So I agree with the off-limit section idea. That is a kind of entry code section
but more generic one. It is natural to split such sensitive code in different
place.

BTW, what about kdb stuffs? (+Cc Jason)

Agreed. That's the reason why I haven't add kprobe-fuzzer yet.
It is easy to make a fuzzer for kprobes by ftrace (note that we need
to enable CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS_ON_NOTRACE=y to check notrace functions),
but there is no way to kick the target code. In the result, most of the
kprobed functions are just not hit. I'm not sure such test code is
reasonable or not.

Hmm, what the offlimit_safecall() does? and what happen if the 
do_fragile_stuff_on_enter() invokes a library code? I think we also need
to tweak kbuild to duplicate some library code to the off-limit text area.

This off-limit text will be good for entries, but I think we still not
able to remove all NOKPROBE_SYMBOLS with this.

For example __die() is marked a NOKPROBE because if we hit a recursive
int3, it calls BUG() to dump stacks etc for debug. So that function
must NOT probed. (I think we also should mark all backtrace functions
in this case, but not yet) Would we move those backtrace related
functions (including printk, and console drivers?) into the offlimit
text too?

Hmm, if there is a bust_kprobes(), that can be easy to fix this issue.
