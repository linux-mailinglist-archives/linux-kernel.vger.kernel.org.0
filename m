Okay. So I read this as invoking schedule() at this point is okay. 
Looking at this again, this could also happen on a PREEMPT=y kernel if
the kernel decides to preempt a task within a rcu_read_lock() section
and put it back later on another CPU.

Isn't that my example from above and what we do in RT? My understanding
is that this is the reason why we need BOOST on RT otherwise the RCU
critical section could remain blocked for some time.

sleeping_lock_inc() +dec() is only RT specific. It is part of RT's
spin_lock() implementation and used by RCU (rcu_note_context_switch())
to not complain if invoked within a critical section.
