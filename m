modversions is ugly, so it would be great if we could dump it.

We have not provided any alternative solution for this, haven't we?

In your patch (https://lwn.net/Articles/707729/),
you proposed CONFIG_MODULE_ABI_EXPLICIT.
If it is good enough for distros, we merge it first,
give them time to migrate over to it, then finally remove modversions??

I agree.
