Hi Andy,

I'm not sure which changes you are referring to. So I'll try to answer
all possibilities :)

If you are referring to the pseudo code proposal, it's mostly
narrowing down the conditions under which the timeout will matter.
1. It's ignoring the timeout stuff if modules are not supported and
all initcall levels are done.
2. If modules are enabled and of_devlink is enabled, it's making sure
the timeout doesn't apply.

(1) seems like a straightforward assumption. (2) is functionally a NOP
for ACPI based platforms. So I don't think we'd have ACPI specific
complications here.

If you were referring to the "of_devlink support for power-domains"
that also won't have any impact on ACPI platforms because right not it
only runs for OF based systems. So again a NOP for ACPI.

Hope that answers your questions.

Thanks,
Saravana
