Thanks Greg for the reply.
I agree, we can trace specific notifier chain, but that is very hacky(we 
have to add debug code here and there when problems comes)

We are using lot of SRCU notifier callchain to notify clients for 
events, And if we have something generic debugging mechanism, we just 
have to switch on for that particular client for initial testing phase.

As mentioned above, if we can come up with something like below then 
only client has to switch on who wants to debug:
 >>   struct srcu_notifier_head {
 >>          struct mutex mutex;
 >>          struct srcu_struct srcu;
 >>          struct notifier_block __rcu *head;
 >> +       bool debug_callback; -> this we can turn on for particular 
client.
 >>   };

Right now we don't have any generic way to debug notifier chains, please 
suggest some approach. On live target, it is difficult to say where 
notification chain got stuck.
