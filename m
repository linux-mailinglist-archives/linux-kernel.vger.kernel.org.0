This is true. But it is not the case for all modules.  In fact it seems
its true that most modules do have *one* main symbol.

On at least Cristina's system of of 62 modules 58 *did* have one symbol.
For the modules evaluated where this was not the case, it did seem wise
to actually revise the symbol definition for the other modules.

The heuristic essentially does this and only provides the module
attribute where this was true.

Yes. For example one hardware device driver may support different
families of chipsets, and so it could have sub-options for each
family.

> So, I would say, "who really cares"?

For most visible modules it would seem we do have a one config symbol
mapping which could enable it. And I noted who would care. The defaults
of a module, for instance sub-options to enable / disable different
support for different chipsets, *should* suffice for most users.

It is basic math though:

Users of 'make localmodconfig' +  backport users > Users of 'make localmodconfig'

And yet we already support 'make localmodconfig'. So what is being
proposed can help enhance 'make localmodconfig' and yet provides more
users outside of those users, without requiring kernel sources.

And I am noting we can further enhance a feature which we already
do support, and enable *more* users requiring similar information.

Right, but at least for device functionality, the above would help
significantly. It also poses the question whether or not device drivers
*should* strive towards having one kconfig symbol to help with this.

There is a lot of research over the lack of proper semantics on use of
kconfig, and issues this causes. It is so bad that some researchers have
tried define our semantics through *reverse engineering*. The question
of whether or not we *should* strive to have *one* symbol per a driver
for an actual hardware component is worth evaluating long term, for the
sake of helping with semantics of kconfig use. I see there being gains
with this, and I find it hard to find counters to where quite the
opposite is true. Can you?

This thread poses the question if we can do better, and suggests one
small area where we can start.

The question we should be evaluating if we *should* strive to buckle up
on this and have at least one config symbol per module associated with
hardware. I'm suggesting there are gains for this, and am providing two
groups of users that would benefit from this clearly. And I'm also
suggesting that it could help with kconfig semantics, long term.
