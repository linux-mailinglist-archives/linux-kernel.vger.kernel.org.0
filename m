Well, the system did spit out a syscall record with the example above,
so it has support for syscall auditing.

I'm testing on f30 with an upstream kernel, the standard 30-stig ruleset and
with kernel command line audit=1.  What else is needed to support a syscall
record on systemd before any audit rules have been put in place?  We may still
have a bug here that affects early process auditing.  What am I missing?

If we can get that sorted out, we don't need subject attributes in this record.

Again, what configuration choice are you talking about?  
"-a task,never"?  That isn't active on this system.

The output was produced by the test case quoted in the patch description.

I should not have had to put a rule in place to do syscall auditing on connect,
bind, setsockopt, close, shutdown.

The disconnect would have been due to a perl close() call.  I would not have
expected that to be async, but I don't know the details of what the perl
implementation does.

Steve, can you say why this order should be the standard?  From:
	http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/audit/record-fields.html

I get:
        SYSCALL/ANOM_LINK/FEATURE_CHANGE
                ppid    pid     auid    uid     gid     euid    suid    fsuid   egid    sgid    fsgid   tty     ses     comm    exe     subj
        ANOM_ABEND/SECCOMP
                                auid    uid     gid     ses     subj    pid     comm    exe
        LOGIN
                pid     uid     subj    old-auid        auid    tty     old-ses ses
        SYSTEM_BOOT/SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN
                pid     uid     auid    ses     subj    comm    exe
        USER_LOGIN
                pid     uid     auid    ses     subj    uid     exe
        DAEMON_START
                                auid    pid     uid     ses     subj
        DAEMON_CONFIG/DAEMON_END
                                auid    pid     subj
        ANOM_PROMISCUOUS
                                auid    uid     gid     ses
        52msgs
                pid     uid     auid    ses     subj	*
        CONFIG_CHANGE
                                auid    ses     subj

This new record is:
        EVENT_LISTENER
                pid     uid     auid    tty     ses     subj    comm    exe

And using the search criteria following, I get no other matches:
        /pid.*uid.*auid.*tty.*ses.*subj.*comm.*exe
so this appears to be a new field order.
