(trolls and misinterpretation abound).

This kind of reasoning presented sounds a lot like cognitive dissonance =

Do I think phk@ and others should potentially take a step back from the =
discussion and avoid digging a larger hole than has already been dug? =
Yes. It=E2=80=99s not my business to make people do that though, since =
I=E2=80=99m not in a leadership/policy making position.

Please leave this discussion on Twitter instead of flooding these =
mailing lists. Linux/OpenBSD should not be exposed to this unnecessary =
drama, and FreeBSD-CURRENT is the wrong mailing list for this (try =
freebsd-chat@ if you are so inclined).
