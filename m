So I applied this, then changed my mind and unapplied it; I think it's the
wrong fix.

This is a section about coping with the removal of the io_request_lock,
which happened in 2.5, prior to the git era.  I think it is probably safe
to say that there are no relevant drivers that still need to be updated
for this particular change.

Here, too.  We're talking about teaching drivers how to use bios.

My suggested fix is to just remove both sections from the document
entirely; neither is relevant in 2019.

Even better, of course, would be to pass through this document and bring
it up to current practice in general; there is certain to be a lot more in
need of fixing here.

Thanks,
