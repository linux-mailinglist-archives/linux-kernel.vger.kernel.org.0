Do you even bother to read what you are commenting upon, or is it simply the
irresistable pleasure of being seen[*]?

When a function called 'test_copy_struct_from_user' starts with a couple of
allocations, one called 'umem_src' and another - 'expected', what could that
possibly be about?  Something to do with testing copy_struct_from_user(),
perhaps?  And, taking a wild guess, maybe allocating a buffer or two to
be somehow used in setting the test up?

Or you could just go and read the damn function, you twit.
