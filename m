Because these are still just the *default* masks - although drivers are 
all expected to call dma_set_mask() and friends explicitly nowadays, 
there are sure to be some out there for 32-bit devices still assuming 
the default 32-bit masks are in place. Thus if platform code secretly 
makes them larger, Bad Things ensue. Making them *smaller* where there 
are platform limitations shouldn't really matter now that we have the 
bus_dma_limit mechanism working well, but also doesn't do any harm, so 
it was left in for good measure.

The current paradigm is that the device masks represent the inherent 
capability of the device as far as the driver knows, and external 
interconnect constraints are kept separately as private DMA API 
internals via the bus limit.

Again, it's only the initial default masks that are truncated, and the 
driver appropriately replaces them with its 64-bit masks anyway once it 
probes. However, bus_dma_limit should still reflect that 36-bit upstream 
constraint, and that's what really matters. If you've found a path 
through a DMA API implementation which is subsequently failing to 
respect that limit, that's a bug in that implementation.

As above, making the "32-bit default" larger than 32 bits stands to 
break 32-bit devices with old drivers, and there's nothing to "fix" at 
this point anyway.

TBH that's never made much sense, unless "driver" was supposed to refer 
to bus code. Its continued presence is down to inertia more than any 
other reason :)
