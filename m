Absolutely not. That creates heavy cache line
contention on the mm_cpumask as we switch the
mm out and back in after an idle period.

The cache line contention on the mm_cpumask
alone can take up as much as a percent of
CPU time on a very busy system with a large
multi-threaded application, multiple sockets,
and lots of context switches.
