Will do.

I do not fully understand this proposal. All those goto labels take care
of the the different failures that can be encountered during the
initialization of the pseudo-lock region. Each initialization failure is
associated with a goto where it jumps to the cleanup path. The
initialization starts with the constraining of the c-states
(initializing plr->pm_reqs), but if I move that I think it will not
reduce the goto labels, just change the order because of the other
initialization done (plr->size, plr->line_size, plr->cpu).

Will do. Seems that I need to check all my code for this pattern.
