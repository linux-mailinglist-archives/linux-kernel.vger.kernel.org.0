Indeed this makes sense.

In the light of strictly adhering to priority based scheduling; yes this makes
sense. Though I still think the migration will produce worse performance, but
I can appreciate even if that was true it breaks the strict priority rule.

I get this.

But not that. Do you mind rephrasing it?

Or let me try first:

	1. Search all priority levels for a fitting CPU
	2. If failed, return the first lowest mask found
	3. If it succeeds, remove any CPU that has a pinned task in it
	4. If the lowest_mask is empty, return (2).
	5. Else return the lowest_mask with the fitting CPU(s)


Did I get it right?

The idea is not to potentially overload that CPU when this pinned task wakes
up? The task could be sleeping waiting for something interesting to poke it..?

Yes. I think that has always been the case with RT. It is very easy to shoot
yourself in the foot.

Thanks for bringing more clarity to this.
