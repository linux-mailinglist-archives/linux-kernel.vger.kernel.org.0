Correct, look like I refereed wrong reference in the above mail. sorry
for the noise.

Actually I'm trying to explain about pll_rate here which indeed
depends on dsi.div
https://github.com/BPI-SINOVOIP/BPI-M64-bsp/blob/master/linux-sunxi/drivers/video/sunxi/disp2/disp/de/disp_lcd.c#L786

lcd_rate = dclk_rate * clk_info.dsi_div;
pll_rate = lcd_rate * clk_info.lcd_div;

Say

1) For 148MHz dclk_rate with dsi_div is 6 (24/4) lcd_div is 1 which
resulting pll_rate is 888MHz.

2) For 30MHz dclk_rate with 4 lane and 24 RGB the resulting pll_rate is 180MHz

3) For 27.5MHz dclk_rate with 2 lane and 24 RGB the resulting pll_rate is 330MHz

Here is the few more logs in code, for case 2)

[    1.920441] sun4i_dclk_round_rate: min_div = 6 max_div = 6, rate = 30000000
