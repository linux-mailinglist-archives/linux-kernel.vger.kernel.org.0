One problem with using a kcontrol as a trigger for the turn-on diagnostic
is that the diagnostic routine has a "return value".

It goes like this:
- Bring device to low-quiescent state
- Initiate diagnostics
- Poll for diagnostics-complete bit
- Read the four channel status registers

The final read clears the status registers, so this isn't something I
can just do with regmap.

One idea I had was to initiate the turn-on diagnostics using a kcontrol,
whose handler saves the four channel status registers and an epoch in
tda7802_priv. Then this can be read from debugfs. But it seems strange
to have to turn on this control over here, then go over there and read
this value.

Hm, maybe a better idea is to have the turn on diagnostic only run on
device probe (as its name suggests!), and print something to dmesg:

	modprobe tda7802 turn_on_diagnostic=1

	tda7802-codec i2c-TDA7802:00: Turn on diagnostic 04 04 04 04

Kirill Marinushkin mentioned this in the first review [0], it just didn't
really sink in until now!
