I wasn't quite sure what to do with it. It does have some points that
are relevant for drivers/gpu/drm that I did not cover in the new document.

Maybe Daniel has an idea for how the two documents can be combined
now, or the overlap reduced.

Ok, done.

Does this only work for function names, or should I also use a different way to
write ``include/uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h`` or ``sizeof(size)`` and
``unsigned long``

Done. See below for changes I did relative to the feedback so far,
now squashed into the latest version.
