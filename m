Yeah. On other SoCs, we certainly have usecases for protected content
with different buffer layouts. The i.MX8M can protect particular
memory areas and partition them to protect access from particular
devices (e.g. display controller and video decoder only, not CPU or
GPU). Those memory areas can contain linear buffers, or tiled buffers,
or supertiled buffers, or ...

Stealing a modifier isn't appropriate.

I totally agree. Framebuffers aren't about the underlying memory they
point to, but about how to _interpret_ that memory: it decorates a
pointer with width, height, stride, format, etc, to allow you to make
sense of that memory. I see content protection as being the same as
physical contiguity, which is a property of the underlying memory
itself. Regardless of the width, height, or format, you just cannot
access that memory unless it's under the appropriate ('secure enough')
conditions.

So I think a dmabuf attribute would be most appropriate, since that's
where you have to do all your MMU handling, and everything else you
need to do to allow access to that buffer, anyway.

Yeah. I know there are a few people looking at this at the moment, so
hopefully we are able to get something up and out in the open as a
strawman.

There's a lot of complexity beyond just 'it's protected'; for
instance, some CP providers mandate that their content can only be
streamed over HDCP 2.2 Type-1 when going through an external
connection. One way you could do that is to use a secure world
(external controller like Intel's ME, or CPU-internal enclave like SGX
or TEE) to examine the display pipe configuration, and only then allow
access to the buffers and/or keys. Stuff like that is always going to
be out in the realm of vendor & product-policy-specific add-ons, but
it should be possible to agree on at least the basic mechanics and
expectations of a secure path without things like that.

Cheers,
Daniel
