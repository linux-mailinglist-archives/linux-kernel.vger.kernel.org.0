Subject: [PATCH RFC 0/7] perf pmu-events: Support event aliasing for system PMUs

Currently event aliasing for only CPU and uncore PMUs is supported. In
fact, only uncore PMUs aliasing for when the uncore PMUs are fixed for a
CPU is supported, which may not always be the case for certain
architectures.

This series adds support for PMU event aliasing for system and other
uncore PMUs which are not fixed to a specific CPU.

For this, we introduce support for another per-arch mapfile, which maps a
particular system identifier to a set of system PMU events for that
system. This is much the same as what we do for CPU event aliasing.

To support this, we need to change how we match a PMU to a mapfile,
whether it should use a CPU or system mapfile. For this we do the
following:

- For CPU PMU, we always match for the event mapfile based on the CPUID.
  This has not changed.

- For an uncore or system PMU, we match first based on the SYSID (if set).
  If this fails, then we match on the CPUID.

  This works for x86, as x86 would not have any system mapfiles for uncore
  PMUs (and match on the CPUID).

Initial reference support is also added for ARM SMMUv3 PMCG (Performance
Monitor Event Group) PMU for HiSilicon hip08 platform with only a single
event so far - see driver in drivers/perf/arm_smmuv3_pmu.c for that driver.

Here is a sample output with this series:

Issues with this series which need to be addressed (aware to me):

- It would be good to have a universal method to identify the system from
  sysfs. Nothing exists which I know about. There is DMI, but this is not
  always available (or has correct info). Maybe systems which want to
  support this feature will need a "soc" driver, and a
  /sys/devices/socX/machine file (which I used for testing this series -
  this driver is out of tree currently).

- Maybe it is ok, but for systems which match on the system identifier,
  uncore PMUs should be in the system mapfile, and, as such, match on the
  system identifier and not CPU identifier.

- We need a better way in jevents.c to give a direct mapping of PMU name
  aliases, i.e. for any PMU name not prefixed with "uncore_", we need to
  add this to table unit_to_pmu[]. Not scalable.

  Having said that, maybe the kernel can introduce some future PMU naming
  convention in future.
