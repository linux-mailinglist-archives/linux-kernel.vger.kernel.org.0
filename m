  https://spdx.org/licenses/

is versioned. It's at version 3.5 and the -only/-or-later tags have been
introduced in version 3.0. See 

  https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0

Well, the problem was that people started to use them and argued that they
are the new standard, which is true. So we decided to allow both. See:

  9376ff9ba298 ("LICENSES/GPL2.0: Add GPL-2.0-only/or-later as valid identifiers")

Nothing. Leave them alone. Both are valid and tools have to deal with them
anyway.

Thanks,
