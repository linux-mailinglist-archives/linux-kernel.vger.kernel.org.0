Each PMCG is conceptually a distinct PMU with its own interrupt - for 
instance, MMU-600 has one PMCG for its TCU and one for each TBU, each 
with a distinct interrupt output signal. Of course, integrators can and 
will mash them all together into a single SPI (particularly since 
they're all part of "the SMMU"), but that boils down to the same case as 
here.

This is going to continue to happen, so we could really do with figuring 
out a way to let MMIO system PMU drivers properly cope with shared 
interrupts in general :/
