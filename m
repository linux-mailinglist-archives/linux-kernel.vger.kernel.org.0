Sounds good.

Sounds good.

That's wrong, don't do that.

->cred is a reference without RCU semantics, ->real_cred is a
reference with RCU semantics. If there have never been any references
with RCU semantics to a specific instance of struct cred, then that
instance can indeed be freed without an RCU grace period. But it would
be possible for some filesystem code to take a reference to
current->cred, and assign it to some pointer with RCU semantics
somewhere, then drop that reference with put_cred() immediately before
you reach put_cred_non_rcu(); with the result that despite using
put_cred(), the other side doesn't get RCU semantics.

Just leave the whole ->non_rcu thing exactly as it was.
