Well, generally speaking, you can add kobject_put() somewhere only if
invoking the ->release() callback for the ktype of the kobject in
question is safe at that point.

Now, it may be unsafe for two reasons: there may be active references
to the memory that would be freed by ->release() along with the
kobject (as you said above) or the code in ->release() may have
assumed some initialization to take place before it runs and so
->release() should not be invoked before completing that
initialization.

Well, I would say we fix all of them, but we are careful enough to
understand what's going on.

And the more complex cases will take more work (and time) to fix.  As
always. :-)
