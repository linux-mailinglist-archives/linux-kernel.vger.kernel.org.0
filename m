Great to hear that :)

I wanted to mean that the mechanism makes no optimal decisions.  Will wordsmith

I was afraid if it is too implementation detail, as this document is for admin
users.  Will add it in next spin, though.

I was worried if it makes too many files.  Do you think it's ok?

Agreed, will change so!
