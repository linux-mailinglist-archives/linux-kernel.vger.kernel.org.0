Maybe it is just me but this doesn't really tell me a lot. What is
Parameter Server workload? What do I do to replicate those numbers? Is
this really specific to the Kunpeng 920 server? What is the usual
variance of the performance numbers?

Whatever data type we use it will be still quite large to be on the
stack.

This is what I was suggesting in previous review feedback.
