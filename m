I like this idea! Sensible defaults that can be selected by just passing
NULL as opts is a laudable goal.

My hunch is that we're kidding ourselves if we think we can avoid the
symbol versioning. And besides, checking struct sizes needs boilerplate
code as well, boilerplate that will fail at runtime instead of compile
time if it's done wrong.

So IMO we're better off just doing symbol version right from the
beginning.

This I agree with :)
