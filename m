Subject: [PATCH v5 4/4] mm: refresh ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 comments in 'enum zone_type'

These zones usage has evolved with time and the comments were outdated.
This joins both ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 explanation and gives up to date
examples on how they are used on different architectures.

Changes in v3:
- Update comment to match changes in arm64

Changes in v2:
- Try another approach merging both ZONE_DMA comments into one
- Address Christoph's comments
- If this approach doesn't get much traction I'll just drop the patch
  from the series as it's not really essential
