I think I may have accidentally deleted your review of Patch 2 so I am
replying to that here. Still quite new to mutt, sorry :p

So these have not been changed since zen1, and are still present as is
in the mainline. Zen2 PPR version 55803 Rev 0.54 does not include them.
But I see that these have been updated even for zen1 in the latest PPR
version 54945 Rev 3.03 so I will add them for both.

Ah I am really sorry, I must have missed these. Should be fixed now.

Yeah, I agree. Will merge the descriptions.

These events are ripe for fusing the public description with the brief
one too, so I will do so as well.
