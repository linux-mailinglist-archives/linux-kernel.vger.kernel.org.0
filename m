lruvec_lru_size is explicitly documented to use MAX_NR_ZONES for all
LRUs and git grep says there are more instances outside of
get_scan_count. So all of them have to be fixed.

I still think that MAX_NR_ZONES - 1 is a very error prone and subtle
construct IMHO and an alias would be better readable.

Anyway I definitely do agree that we do not want to use both
(MAX_NR_ZONES and MAX_NR_ZONES - 1) because that is even more confusing.
