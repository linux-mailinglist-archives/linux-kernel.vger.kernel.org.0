I'm a bit confused by this. I, and I believe Alex, kept going down a
different path because it didn't sound like there was a solution to
the compaction race. As I remember, the conversation ended on this:

: Your race here (again, lruvec lock taken then PageLRU observed, but
: page->mem_cgroup changed in between) really questions my whole scheme:
: I am not going to propose a solution now, I'll have to go back and
: recheck my assumptions all over.  Certainly isolate_migratepage_block()
: has a harder job than any other, but I need to re-review it all.

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/alpine.LSU.2.11.1911221616580.1144@eggly.anvils/

That's certainly why I kept looking and eventually proposed using
PageLRU clearing as a lock. Maybe there is a better way to do it, but
I didn't see it.

An LRU list corruption in page_cache_release() suggests a bug in the
way this new locking scheme works or is applied - rather than a
gratuitous divergence from your series that could have been avoided.

I think that would be very useful. tmpfs+loop+swapping+memcg+ksm
kernel builds aren't exactly a go-to test case for most mm developers
(although maybe they should be!)
