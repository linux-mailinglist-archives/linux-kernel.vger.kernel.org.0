Right, it looks like this is a bit of a smoking gun and we need to decide
on whether list_empty() is actually usable without synchronisation first.
Based on the outcome of that discussion, I'll update this patch accordingly.

The main thing I want to avoid is marking parts of the non-RCU list
implementation with data_race() or {READ,WRITE}_ONCE() because that's a
sure-fire way to hide real bugs.

Cheers,

Will
