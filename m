Details should have been in the commit message :(

To a point, that's fine.  Making odd changes that are not
self-documenting or understandable even in the commit that is trying to
tadd them, is not ok at all.

Don't do sysrq-t then :)

And as I said above, make these totally and completly obvious what you
are doing.  At worst, this should have been a patch series that gives
this type of information in each and every place it is added, so at
least it is documented somewhere.  At best, it needs to be in the code
itself to make it obvious what you are doing and why it needs to stay
there for all eternity.

No but.  Again, you are running a fuzzer as root.  You will end up doing
things that are bad.  Don't do those things.  Don't force the kernel to
keep track of the things you should not do, that's up to you and your
environment, not ours.

Maybe someone writes a fuzzer someday that does not need all of these
things, what then?  :)

Again, see above for what you shoudl have said.

And this still is really odd.

Removing WARNING strings is great, and is one thing and that kind of
thing has been merged as fixes for a while.  Messing with kernel log
levels is something totally different.

Ok, but I don't see how the above log level change does that.

As it is, this patch isn't acceptable at all for all of the reasons
above.
