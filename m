What's fun is that we should be able to identify a stream ID for most 
context faults *except* translation faults...

We've considered threaded IRQs before, and IIRC the problem with doing 
it at the architectural level is that in some cases the fault interrupt 
can only be deasserted by actually resuming/terminating the stalled 
transaction.

With the above said, I am in the middle of a big refactoring[1] to allow 
everyone's imp-def stuff to coexist nicely, so ultimately if qcom 
implementations can guarantee the appropriate hardware behaviour then 
they can have their own interrupt handlers to accommodate this.
