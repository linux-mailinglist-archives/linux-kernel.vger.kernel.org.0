But these 2 cases do not differ. If we can use mb() if GP_EXIT, then we can
do the same if state == GP_PASSED and just move the state to GP_IDLE, and
remove both GP_PASSED/GP_REPLAY states.

However, in this case the readers will need the barrier too, and rcu_sync_enter()
will _always_ need to block (wait for GP).

rcu_sync.c is "equivalent" to the following implementation:


            struct rcu_sync_struct {
                    atomic_t writers;
            };

            bool rcu_sync_is_idle(rss)
            {
                    return atomic_read(rss->writers) == 0;
            }

            void rcu_sync_enter(rss)
            {
                    atomic_inc(rss->writers);
                    synchronize_rcu();
            }

            void rcu_sync_exit(rss)
            {
                    synchronize_rcu();
                    atomic_dec(rss->writers);
            }

except

	- rcu_sync_exit() never blocks

	- synchronize_rcu/call_rci is called only if it is really needed.
	  In particular, if 2 writers come in a row the 2nd one will not
	  block in _enter().

Oleg.
