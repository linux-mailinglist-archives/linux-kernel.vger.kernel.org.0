Oh, I misunderstood.  I see your point.  Define the symbol as a number
for what level of output flags you support (ie. the __cplusplus
macro).

I still don't think feature detection is worse than version detection
(until you find your feature broken in a way that forces the use of
version detection).

Just to prove my point about version checks being brittle, it looks
like Rasmus' version check isn't even right.  GCC supported `asm
inline` back in the 8.3 release, not 9.1 as in this patch:
https://godbolt.org/z/1woitS .  So users of gcc-8.2 and gcc-8.3
wouldn't be able to take advantage of `asm inline` even though their
compiler supported it.

Or was it "broken" until 9.1?  Lord knows, as `asm inline` wasn't in
any release notes or bug reports I can find:
8: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-8/changes.html
9: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-9/changes.html
Bug tracker query:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=3DUNCONFIRMED&bug_statu=
s=3DNEW&bug_status=3DASSIGNED&bug_status=3DSUSPENDED&bug_status=3DWAITING&b=

pe=3Danywordssubstr

Ah, here it is:
https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/commit/6de46ad5326fc5e6b730a2feb8c62d09c1=
561f92
Which looks like the qualifier was added to this page:
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html

I like many of the GNU C extensions, and I want to help support them
in Clang so that they can be used in more places, but the current
process (and questions I have when I implement some of them) leaves me
with the sense that there's probably room for improvement on some of
these things before they go out the door.

Segher, next time there's discussion about new C extensions for the
kernel, can you please include me in the discussions?
