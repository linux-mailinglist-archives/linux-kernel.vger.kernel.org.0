+Kees who can probably explain this better.

This early added entropy is also going to be used for stack canary. At
the time it's created there's not be much entropy (before
boot_init_stack_canary(), there's only add_latent_entropy() and
command_line).
On arm64, there is a single canary for all tasks. If RNG is weak or
the seed can be read, it might be easier to figure out the canary.

We can try to map it to RW and map back to RO later if needed on
arm64, like Stephen's suggestion.

Thanks for the comments and suggestions.
