So what is the use case here?  Allocate pages using the page allocator
(or CMA for that matter), and then mmaping them to userspace and never
touching them again from the kernel?

This was just my through as the fit seems easy.  But maybe you'll
need to explain your use case(s) a bit more so that we can figure out
what a good high level API is.

They could have an aliased mapping in vmalloc/vmap space for example,
if you created one.  We have the flush_kernel_vmap_range /
invalidate_kernel_vmap_range APIs for those, that are implement
on architectures with VIVT caches.
