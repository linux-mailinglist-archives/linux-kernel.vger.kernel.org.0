I tested this and it resolves my report! Thanks for a timely fix.

I agree with the analysis. Perhaps it would make sense in the long term
to find a solution where get_cpu_cap can remember what was cleared for
each CPU and restore those? It already does this using the global
variables...

Thanks,
Jake
