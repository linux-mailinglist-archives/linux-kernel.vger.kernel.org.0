I understand. However, it is *necessary* for EFI runtime services to
be available somehow, and this design needs to make that possible.
Either EFI runtime services need to be considered part of the TCB, or
we need a mechanism to re-verify the state of the system after making
an EFI call (such as Andy's suggestion).

I think it's reasonable to assert that boot services can't be part of
the TCB in this case, and as a result you're justified in not using
the firmware's TPM implementation. However, we still need a solution
for access to runtime services.
