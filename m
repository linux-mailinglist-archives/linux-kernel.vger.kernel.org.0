I'm not familar with LPC controller, but seems it could not perform
read/write by one memory access or io access instruction

I didn't find an existing bus_type for LPC bus, so I think regmap is a
good way. When you have implemented the regmap for LPC bus, you need to
access the CPLD registers by regmap_read/write, and just pass CPLD local
register addr as parameter.

I quickly checked the logic PIO. When you implemented logic_pio for your lpc
and CPLD, you create an map from IO port addr to CPLD register addr. You
need to use inb/outb to access CPLD register (with some uncertain IO addrs?)

I'm not sure why it is needed to access non-pio devices using PIO, it
may be of some special purpose? 

Regmap may be a general choise.

How the host cpu is connected to LPC host?
Why an I2C controller driver for LPC host? The LPC bus is compatible to i2c bus?
