The only reason for >= vs. > is to do less work in the == case.

(I prefer to stay in the first backtracking loop, which does no
data motion, and therby reduce the number of swaps performed in
the second part of the backtracking.)

If you want to preserve the logic exactly, you can replace
"do_cmp(a, b, ...) >= 0" with "do_cmp(b, a, ...) <= 0" and then
the conversion is straightforward.
