Note that I didn't bother reading the whole driver, just focused on the
exec_op() implementation. Please look at what other drivers are doing
before posting a new version and don't hesitate to ask questions if
there's something you don't understand. We are already at v17, and
unfortunately, the driver is IMO not ready to be merged :-/.
