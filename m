Hi Tuan,

As Will said, *please* set up a more usual mail clinet configuration if
you can. The reply style (with lines starting with '=>') is unusual and
very painful to spot.

Sure, you only *describe* that in the ACPI tables, but I can't see how
that's access control is enforced in the hardware, because these
registers fall in the same 4K page as other control registers, and
AFAICT the IP doesn't distinguish S/NS accesses.

If the Secure world on your part uses DRAM (including the secure
portions of IPs like SMMUs), you *must* ensure that the Normal world
cannot access those other control registers, or it can corrupt Secure
world state and escalate privilege.

Is that not a concern here?

I don't believe that is correct; see below w.r.t. the ACPI binding.

Linux needs to ensure that the same instance is concistently accessed
from the same CPU, and needs to migrate the IRQ to handle that. Given we
do that on a per-instance basis, we cannot share the IRQ with another
instance.

Please feed back to you HW designers that muxing IRQs like this causes
significant problems for software.

Thanks for the link! For this _HID, the document says the _CRS contains
a QWordMemory Base address, which the full description is:

| Base Address of the DMC620 in the system address map

... which would presumably mean the *entire* set of MMIO registers, not
just the PMU portion. The example firmly hints that it is the entire set
of MMIO registers:

| In this example, the DMC620 register space is mapped to a 64K range
| that begins at offset 0x80CAFE0000 in the system address space

Thanks,
Mark.
