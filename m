Yes. Go sucks for this.

As I understand it you should be able to write socketat in go something like:

	runtime.LockOSThread()
        err = netns.Set(newns);
        fd = socket(...);
        err = netns.Set(defaultns);
	runtime.UnlockOSThread()

I have no real objections to a kernel system call doing that.  It has
just never risen to the level where it was necessary to optimize
userspace yet.
