Hi Martijn,

Is the loop driver used in Android Q to make a file on a filesystem 
visible as a block device or rather to make a subset of a block device 
visible as a block device? In the latter case, have you considered to 
use the dm-linear driver instead? I expect that the overhead per I/O of 
dm-linear will be lower than that of the loop driver.

Bart.
