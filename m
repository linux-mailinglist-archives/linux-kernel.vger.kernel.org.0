The issue still exists so why not discussing it here?

Placing thermal related time shift operations in a
update_*thermal*_load_avg() PELT function look perfectly fine to me.

That's not the issue here. The issue is the extra shim layer which is
unnecessary in the current implementation.

update_blocked_averages()
{
    ...
    update_rt_rq_load_avg()
    update_dl_rq_load_avg()
    update_irq_load_avg()
    trigger_thermal_pressure_average() <--- ?
    ...
}

Wouldn't a direct call to update_thermal_load_avg() here make things so
much more clear? And I'm not talking about today and about people
involved in this review.

I just did.
