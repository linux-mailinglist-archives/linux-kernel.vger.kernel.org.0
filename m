Sure. But the point is that we're spreading that kind of checks all 
over
the map, and that we don't have a way to even reason about the state of
a 64bit counter. Doesn't it strike you as being mildly broken?

Hey, I didn't say it was perfect ;-). But for sure we can't let the
PMU bitrot more than it already has, and I'm not sure this is heading
the right way.

I'm certainly going to push back on new PMU features until we can 
properly
reason about 64bit counters as a top-level entity (as opposed to a 
bunch
of discrete counters).

Thanks,
