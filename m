I think this should be okay atleast for my case.

My dt node will looks something like this
serdes_mux: mux-controller {
	compatible = "mmio-mux";
        #mux-control-cells = <1>;
        mux-reg-masks = <0x4080 0x3>, /* SERDES0 lane select */
                        <0x4090 0x3>; /* SERDES1 lane select */
}

Here SERDES lane0 is muxed between PCIe0 Lane0, ICSS2 SGMII Lane0.
The consumers of SERDES0 (in this case PCIe and ICSS), will have to invoke
->xlate of AM654 SERDES driver to select the mux and ->busy should be able to
tell whether it is available.

Only when multiple drivers try to get devm_mux_control_get and use
mux_control_select, the problem might occur. For my case, only SERDES is the
consumer of mux.

Yes right. It'll be for the entire up time. Well, with dt overlay this could
change.

Yes, having an exclusive mux will make sure no one can accidentally modify the mux.

Are you trying to make sure there is no deadlock when two different consumers
try to control a shared mux?
