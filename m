Don't know what happened but my MUA can't seem to thread these patches.
I wonder if something got messed up during send?

Can it be GPL or BSD 2 clause?

What is EC_USB_PD_MAX_PORTS? Can this be done through a reg property
instead?

I don't think this is necessary with enum below. schema can figure out
that max is 1.

Other bindings have newlines between properties. Can you please add them
to improve readability?

How does this interact with power-role above? Is it different?

I thought that perhaps this would be done with the OF graph APIs instead
of being a child of the ec node. I don't see how the usb connector is
anything besides a child of the top-level root node because it's
typically on the board. We put board level components at the root.

Yes, the connector is intimately involved with the EC here, but I would
think that we would have an OF graph connection from the USB controller
on the SoC to the USB connector, traversing through anything that may be
in that path, such as a USB hub. Maybe the connector node itself can
point to the EC type-c controller with some property like

	connector {
		...
		type-c-manager =3D <&phandle_to_typec_manager>
	};

So in the end it would look like this (note that the ec doesn't have a sub-=
node
to make a driver probe):

	/ {
		connector@0 {
			compatible =3D "usb-c-connector";
			label =3D "left";
			reg =3D <0>;
			power-role =3D "dual";
			type-c-manager =3D <&cros_ec>;
			...

			ports {=20
				#address-cells =3D <1>;
				#size-cells =3D <0>;

				port@0 {
					reg =3D <0>;
					left_ufp: endpoint {
						remote-endpoint =3D <&usb_controller0>;
					};
				};
			};
		};

		connector@1 {
			compatible =3D "usb-c-connector";
			label =3D "right";
			reg =3D <1>;
			power-role =3D "dual";
			type-c-manager =3D <&cros_ec>;
			...

			ports {=20
				#address-cells =3D <1>;
				#size-cells =3D <0>;

				port@0 {
					reg =3D <0>;
					right_ufp: endpoint {
						remote-endpoint =3D <&usb_controller1>;
					};
				};
			};
		};

		soc@0 {
			#address-cells =3D <1>;
			#size-cells =3D <0>;

			spi@a000000 {
				compatible =3D "soc,spi-controller";
				reg =3D <0xa000000 0x1000>;
				cros_ec: ec@0 {
					compatible =3D "google,cros-ec-spi";
					reg =3D <0>;
				};
			};

			usb@ca00000 {
				compatible =3D "soc,dwc3-controller";
				reg =3D <0xca00000 0x1000>;

				ports {
					port@0 {
						reg =3D <0>;
						usb_controller0: endpoint {
							remote-endpoint =3D <&left_ufp>;
						};
					};
				};
			};

			usb@ea00000 {
				compatible =3D "soc,dwc3-controller";
				reg =3D <0xea00000 0x1000>;

				ports {
					port@0 {
						reg =3D <0>;
						usb_controller1: endpoint {

	};
