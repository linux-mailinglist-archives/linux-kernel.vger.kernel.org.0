That sentance does not make sense.  fdc2de87124f ("serial/8250: Add
support for NI-Serial PXI/PXIe+485 devices") is in the 5.4 kernel tree,
where did the commit id "225607f75454" come from?  I don't see it
anywhere in Linus's tree.

I can not parse this paragraph either, what do you mean by "The
upstream"?

So this patch really does not work at all?  Can't you just find a simple
fix to go on top of it to resolve the issue?  You really want it all
ripped out for 5.5 and 5.4.y?

thanks,
