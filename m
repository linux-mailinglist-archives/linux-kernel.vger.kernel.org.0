I tried the patch below, but it did not seem to make a difference to the
issue I was seeing. My test tree is here in case you can spot anything I did
not do right: https://github.com/joelagnel/linux-kernel/commits/rcu/nohz-test
The main patch is here:
https://github.com/joelagnel/linux-kernel/commit/4dc282b559d918a0be826936f997db0bdad7abb3

On the trace output, I grep something like: egrep "(rcu_perf|cpu 3|3d)". I
see a few ticks after 300ms, but then there are no more ticks and just a
periodic resched_cpu() from rcu_implicit_dynticks_qs():

That makes sense!

I did not fully understand the question in brackets though, a task can be on
a different CPU though which has nothing to do with the CPU that's going
offline/online so it could totally be waiting on a grace period right?

Also waiting on a grace period that hasn't even started is totally possible:

     GP1         GP2
|<--------->|<-------->|
     ^                 ^
     |                 |____  task gets unblocked
task blocks
on synchronize_rcu
but is waiting on
GP2 which hasn't started

Or did I misunderstand the question?

thanks!
