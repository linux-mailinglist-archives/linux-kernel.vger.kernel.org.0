It's not so much arguing but rather trying to understand your concerns 
and your perception of what the final code should look like.

So is it that you want pte_entry() to be strictly called for *each* 
virtual address, even if we have a pmd_entry()?
In that case I completely follow your arguments, meaning we skip this 
patch completely?

My take on the change was that pmd_entry() returning 0 would mean we 
could actually skip the pte level completely and nothing would otherwise 
pass down to the next level for which split_huge_pmd() wasn't a NOP, 
similar to how pud_entry does things. FWIW, see

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20191004123732.xpr3vroee5mhg2zt@box.shutemov.name/

and we could in the long run transform the pte walk in many pmd_entry 
callbacks into pte_entry callbacks.

No, it's typically a NOP, since the hugepmd should be read-only. 
Write-enabled huge pages are split in fault().

Well, this is not what we want to do, and the reason we have the patch 
in the first place.
