Hi Horatiu,
One issue in general - some functions are used before they're defined (the switchdev
API integration ones) patch 4 vs 7 which doesn't make sense. Also I see that the BRIDGE_MRP is used
(ifdef) before it's added to the Kconfig which doesn't make much sense either.
I think you should rearrange the patches and maybe combine some of them.

Thanks,
 Nik
