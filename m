Absolutely.  Anyone who hasn't reviewed a patch to the best of their
ability before providing their {Acked,Reviewed}-by would be a very
silly person indeed.

But that's not what you said and it not what I'm disagreeing with, is
it?  See above, you said "[an Acked-by] means to me that you've done
the same level of review as Reviewed-by", which I do not agree with.

A Reviewed-by to me means that a person knows the area, including
possible side-effects a patch may cause.  In this EXTx case, I do not
consider myself a domain expert and thus am not in a position to
provide that level of review.  Instead, the patch was reviewed on its
own merits, and since it looked good (which it still does), an
Acked-by was provided.

Exactly, there's that *if* I was talking about.  "IF, a patch affects
multiple subsystems".  This patch does not.  The Acked by is also not
coming from a maintainer from this subsystem, thus this statement does
not come into play.

> My question is what is the *point* of including a non-maintainer's
> Acked-by: to the git record?

You'll have to take that up with the documentation, which clearly
states:

 "Acked-by: indicates an agreement by another developer (often a
  maintainer of the relevant code) that the patch is appropriate for
  inclusion into the kernel.

... which is *exactly* as I meant it.  I, as 'another developer', do
consider this patch appropriate for the inclusion into the kernel.

How is that less than totally clear?  If the documentation is wrong,
something needs to be done about that.  Until then, I shall continue
using Acked-bys to mean "I'm not an expert in this area, but based on
the patch alone, the change looks good to me".

A reviewer will normally indicate which portion of the code has been
reviewed, which can then be reflected in the change-log.  If a
maintainer Ack is applied, it can be assumed that only the part under
their jurisdiction is relevant.  If not a maintainer or core-dev, and
no extra indication is provided, then I think we can assume they
reviewed the whole patch.  Extra indication can look like this in the
*rare cases* a non-maintainer/core-dev provides a part-review:

  Acked-by: Joe Bloggs <j.b@someemail.com> [ext2]

See 8a7f97b902f4 ("treewide: add checks for the return value of
memblock_alloc*()") as the first example I came across.

Your review should not replace and over-ride another review (unless
you disagree with it, obviously), it should compliment it.  Both *-bys
should be added to the patch when/if it is applied.

Perfect.  This is a positive statement. The way you worded this before
was very negative and almost sounded like a threat.

Absolutely.  I even alluded to this in my previous email.  Ah bugger!
After trying and find that part in order to quote it, it became
apparent that I took that sentence out.  But yes, I totally agree with
you, reviews mean more if they are from an independent source.

+1

NB: I still keep the *-bys applied when merging a patch, even if they
do not hold much gravitas during my review process.

I can't think of a time I have been on either end of this situation.
If I saw anyone doing this I would call them out on it.

Just to clarify, in case you think that's what is happening here (I'm
sure you've looked though the Git log and seen for yourself, but
still); I reviewed this patch solely because I am helping Philippe
through the process of becoming a Kernel contributor, since he showed
a great deal of interest and enthusiasm for it when I met him a few
weeks ago whilst rock climbing.

Right, this drives me mad also.

That's wrong of you.  I do not support this behaviour at all.  If
someone has gone to the trouble to review a patch and provide a
suitable *-by, you, as the maintainer have a duty to credit this work
by applying it to the patch (if accepted).

Of course the statement above comes with some caveats.  For example if
you think someone is gaming the Git statistics, then you have a right
to call them out and not apply the tag.  However, you really should be
giving people (especially people you don't know) the benefit of the
doubt.

That policy is crazy.  You are saying that people should only be
providing negative reviews?  So what happens if someone conducts a
review and they cannot find anything wrong with the submission?  You
are suggesting that you are not going to apply their tag anyway, so
what would be the point in them providing one?  You are essentially
saying that unless they have previously given a patch a NACK, then
don't bother to provide an ACK.  Bonkers!
