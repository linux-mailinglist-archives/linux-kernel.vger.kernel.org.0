I think the general rule of thumb that was followed was to have
all pinmux configurations in soc file and all pinconf setting in
the board, even though it meant a bit of duplication in some cases.
See [1] for some discussions around it that happened in the past.

Right, I did mention it in the cover letter, perhaps I should have mentioned it
as part of this patch as well.

I had a re-look at the documentation again and yes, you are
right, this seems exactly same as on sdm845 except that on
sdm845 the 2 blocks were named QUPV3_0_QUPV3_ID_1 at 0x00800000
and QUPV3_1_QUPV3_ID_1 at 0x00a00000.
I will match this up with the labeling approach we followed on
sdm845. Thanks.

I will move this to uart10 once I have the qup instance marked with id_1.
On sdm845 the qup_id_0 had SE instances from 0 to 7 and qup_id_1 had it
from 8 to 15. I will follow the same here so this uart instance would
remain the same as on sdm845, which is uart10.

thanks,
Rajendra
