The reason is not the disagreement, but how you're (not) answering my 
arguments.
Like in the other thread, the question about the uselessness of the 
flash_lock
and flash_unlock tools with SPI-NOR and the (IMHO) bad behaviour when 
the user
actually uses flash_lock. Please, don't take this personally, I'll buy 
you a
beer at FOSDEM :p back to the technical stuff.

MX25U3232F, MX25U3235F, MX25U3273F, MX25U3235E all use the same 0x2c2536
identification. And these are only the active ones. I bet there are a
bunch of older 32MBit flashes.

MX25U6432F, MX25U6472F, MX25U6433F, MX25U6435F, MX25U6473F all use the
same 0x2c2537 id.

W25Q32JW-IQ, W25Q32DW, W25Q32FW all use the same 0x156016 id.

btw. thats why I argued to just have MX25U32 or W25Q32 as a name for the
flashes.

ok, I'll do so for the MX25U3232F support.

and making assumptions which are true for the flashes you currently know

See above, the assumption that newer flashes have differnet jedec-ids is 
wrong.

Well what are the disadvantages? I don't argue against the 
autodetection. I
argue to have a mechanism _already_ in place when the autodetection 
fails.
If you don't specify the hint, everything stays the same.

We could have the advantages of both worlds, have a generic "w25q32" 
which tries
its best for autodetection and a specific "w25q32fw" which could can be 
hinted.
Same for like "mx25u32" and "mx25u3232f", "mx25u3235f" etc.
