So, it looks like that Shardmap could be better for the case of billion =
files in one folder.
But what=E2=80=99s about the regular case when it could be =
dozens/hundreds of files in one
folder? Will Shardmap be better than HTree? If the ordinary user =
hasn=E2=80=99t visible
performance improvement then it makes sense to consider Shardmap like =
the
optional feature. What do you think?

Does it mean that Shardmap is ext4 oriented only? Could it be used for =
another
file systems?

I slightly missed the point here. To read the whole directory sounds =
like to read
the dentries tree from the volume. As far as I can see, the dentries are =
ordered
by names or by hashes. But if we are talking about inode number then we =
mean
the inodes tree. So, I have misunderstanding here. What do you mean?

I meant the Shardmap implementation. As far as I can see, the user-space =
implementation
is available only now. So, my question is still here. It=E2=80=99s hard =
to say how efficient the Shardmap
could be on kernel side as ext4 subsystem, for example.

It sounds like adding updates in log-structured manner. But what=E2=80=99s=
 about
the obsolete/invalid blocks? Does it mean that it need to use some GC =
technique
here? I am not completely sure that it could be beneficial for the ext4.

By the way, could the old index blocks be used like the snapshots in the =
case
of corruptions or other nasty issues?

It=E2=80=99s hard to talk about stability because we haven=E2=80=99t =
kernel-side implementation
of Shardmap for ext4. I suppose that it needs to spend about a year for =
the porting
and twice more time for the stabilization. To port a user-space code to =
the kernel
could be the tricky task. Could you estimate how many lines of code the =
core
part of Shardmap contains? Does it need to change the ext4 on-disk =
layout for
this feature? How easy ext4 functionality can be modified for Shardmap =
support?

Thanks,
