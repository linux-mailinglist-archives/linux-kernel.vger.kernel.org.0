Actually even non-RT will assert if you do local_bh_enable() with IRQs
disabled -- but the other combinations do work, and are used some places via
spinlocks.  If they are used via direct calls to preempt_disable() or
local_irq_disable() (or via raw spinlocks), then that will not go away on RT
and we'll have a problem.

For now, yes.  Long term it would be good to keep track of when
preemption/irqs would be disabled on RT, even when running a non-RT debug
kernel, and assert when bad things are done with it (assuming an RT-capable
arch).  Besides detecting these fairly unusual patterns, it could also
detect earlier the much more common problem of nesting a non-raw spinlock
inside a raw spinlock or other RT-atomic context.
