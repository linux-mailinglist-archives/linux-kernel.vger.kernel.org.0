Sure, yes on second thought it is more linear than exponential :)

Cool, thanks for that insight. It has been some years since I used a logic
analyzer for some bus protocol debugging, but those are fun!

That sounds great to me, there's no other locking performance tests in the
kernel. There's locking api selftests at boot (DEBUG_LOCKING_API_SELFTESTS)
which just tests whether lockdep catches locking issues, and there's
locktorture, but I believe none of these test for lock performance.

I think a lockperf.c could also test other things about locking mechanisms,
such as how they perform if the owner of the lock is currently running vs
sleeping, while another thread is trying to acquire etc. What do you think? I
can add this to my list to do. Right now I'm working on the list-RCU lockdep
checking I started to work on [1] and want to post another series soon.

Thanks a lot,

- Joel
