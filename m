What do you expect these systems to do though?

I mean, think about general purpose distros: they put together live
images that are supposed to work on a myriad of similar (as in: same
arch) but otherwise very different systems (i.e. VMs that might lack
any form of RNG source the same as beefy servers with muliple sources
the same as older netbooks with few and crappy sources, â€¦). They can't
know what the specific hw will provide or won't. It's not their
incompetence that they build the image like that. It's a common, very
common usecase to install a system via SSH, and it's also very common
to have very generic images for a large number varied systems to run
on.
