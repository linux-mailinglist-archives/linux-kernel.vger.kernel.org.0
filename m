Indeed. The offending symbol depended on another symbol, which never
made it to next before it hit mainline, thus hiding the issue.

I agree.

Retiring COMPILE_TEST could have a positive side-effect, though: it
would reduce the compile time for all*config, which might give the
overloaded build bots spare cycles to cover other configs.
