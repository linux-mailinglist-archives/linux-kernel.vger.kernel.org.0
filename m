Hopefully one last thing, which will explain why you may not be able
to get an IP address even with some of these tweaks I've been getting
you to try.  Do you have either none or both of these commits in your
kernel?

0672d22a1924 ("ARM: dts: imx: Fix the AR803X phy-mode")
6d4cd041f0af ("net: phy: at803x: disable delay only for RGMII mode")

I think you'll have the latter but not the former.  You will need the
former if you have the latter.

I think this thread is a good illustration why breaking existing DT
compatibility - even for the sake of fixing a bug - is just bad news.
