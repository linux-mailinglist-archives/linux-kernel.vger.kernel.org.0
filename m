A better fix would be to revert this patch.  It doesn't fix a real bug.
The ->num_resources is typically under 5.  It's not going to overflow
INT_MAX any time soon.  There are "architectures with smaller ints."

It should always be "int i" unless there is a valid real life reason.
People think that declaring everything as u32 will fix bugs but it
normally just introduces bugs as it does here.  u32 makes the code
harder to read.

This is a sore spot for me because apparently there is a static
analysis tool which tells people to use "u32 i;" everywhere.  It's bad
advice.  I have asked around but I haven't found which tool it is, but
which  we should find the tool and delete it to prevent this kind of
stuff in the future.
