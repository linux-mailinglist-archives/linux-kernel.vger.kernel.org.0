Hi Rashmica,

let us go the easy way here.
Could you please explain:

1) How memtrace works
2) Why it was designed, what is the goal of the interface?
3) When it is supposed to be used?

I have seen a couple of reports in the past from people running memtrace
and failing to do so sometimes, and back then I could not grasp why people
was using it, or under which circumstances was nice to have.
So it would be nice to have a detailed explanation from the person who wrote
it.

Thanks
