Correct. And the motivation for this is that if you use a dtb from the
future it might describe a power-domain provider that is not yet
implemented in the booting kernel and as such the purpose is to fail
fast - in a way that drivers can ignore, rather than probe deferring
indefinitely.

This extends the time that probe deferral is functional from
late_initcall to 2 minutes from boot, which should solve all practical
problems you and I have with the current situation.

But the specific detail that your patch is missing is that drivers that
probe defer will end up on the deferral list and this list is only
processed whenever drivers are added or some driver succeeds to probe.
So before the 2 minutes the deferral dance will stop and you need one of
these events to kick off the dance again.

Cool

Thank you for working on this, I've spent days debugging subtle issues
because of this feature...
