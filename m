Right. At least it would be nice to have for zone shrinking - not sure abou=
t the other walkers. We would have to special-case ZONE_DEVICE handling the=
re.

But as I said, a subsection map for online memory is a good start, especial=
ly to fix pfn_to_online_page(). Also, I think this might be a very good thi=
ng to have for Oscars memmap-on-memory work (I have a plan in my head I can=
 discuss with Oscar once he has time to work on that again).
