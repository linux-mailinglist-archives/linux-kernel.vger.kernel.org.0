I'm not sure this is a good idea, since there will probably need to be more
places where built-in code calls into fs/crypto/ too.

There's actually already fscrypt_sb_free(), which this patch forgets to handle:

	void fscrypt_sb_free(struct super_block *sb)
	{
		key_put(sb->s_master_keys);
		sb->s_master_keys = NULL;
	}

Though we could make that an inline function.

But there's also a patch under review which adds inline encryption support to
ext4 and f2fs, which requires calling into fs/crypto/ from fs/buffer.c in order
to set an encryption context on bios:

https://lkml.kernel.org/linux-fscrypt/20191218145136.172774-10-satyat@google.com/

If we also add direct I/O support for inline encryption (which is planned), it
would require calling into fs/crypto/ from fs/direct-io.c and
fs/iomap/direct-io.c as well.

Another thing I've been thinking about is adding decryption support to
__block_write_begin(), which would allow us to delete ext4_block_write_begin(),
which was copied from __block_write_begin() to add decryption support.

So more broadly, the issue is that a lot of the filesystem I/O helpers
(fs/buffer.c, fs/iomap/, fs/direct-io.c, fs/mpage.c) are already built-in, and
it can be necessary to call into fs/crypto/ from such places.

Is it really much of an issue to just disable CONFIG_FS_ENCRYPTION when you want
to test building the crypto API as a module?

This code would actually need to go into fs/crypto/bio.c because it depends on
CONFIG_BLOCK.  UBIFS uses fs/crypto/ without CONFIG_BLOCK necessarily being set.

There's a bit more that would need to be done here:

	mempool_destroy(fscrypt_bounce_page_pool);

and

	fscrypt_exit_keyring()
		=> unregister_key_type(&key_type_fscrypt);
		=> unregister_key_type(&key_type_fscrypt_user);
