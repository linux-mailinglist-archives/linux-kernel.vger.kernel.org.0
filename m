Hey.

Since I've upgraded from kernel 5.2 to 5.3 my system runs a
considerably higher temperatures (like 10Â°C or more).
This happens even when it's effectively idle (top shows basically
nothing).
Downgrading again to 5.2 and high temperatures go away.

I did some more detailed description here:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=945055
but really have no clue where to start debugging.

It could be that it's somehow graphics related, as when I switch away
from X/Cinnamon to the virtual console, temperatures decrease
considerably.


Anyone else seeing something similar or having some idea how to track
this down?


Thanks,
Chris.
