The oom heuristic is based on the reclaim failure. If the reclaim makes
some progress then the oom killer is not hit. Have a look at
should_reclaim_retry for more details.

No, there is nothing like that.

PSI is measuring the cost of the allocation (among other things) and
that can give you some idea on how much time is spent to get memory.
Userspace can implement a policy based on that and act. The kernel oom
killer is the last resort when there is really no memory to allocate.
