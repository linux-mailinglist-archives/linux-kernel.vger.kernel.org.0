It is not normal the something needs to allocate memory under
console_sem. Console drivers are supposed to get the message
out even when the system is in really bad state and it is not
possible to allocate memory. I consider this a bug in the console
driver.

The new printk should prevent all deadlocks simply because it will
be fully lockless. The console drivers will be called from dedicated
kthreads and therefore from a well defined context.
