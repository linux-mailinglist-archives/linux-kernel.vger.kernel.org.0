Convert ROHM bd71837 and bd71847 PMIC binding text docs to yaml. Split
the binding document to two separate documents (own documents for BD71837
and BD71847) as they have different amount of regulators. This way we can
better enforce the node name check for regulators. ROHM is also providing
BD71850 - which is almost identical to BD71847 - main difference is some
initial regulator states. The BD71850 can be driven by same driver and it
has same buck/LDO setup as BD71847 - add it to BD71847 binding document and
introduce compatible for it.

Resending for Mark to check.

changes since v1:
- constrains to short and long presses.
- reworded commit message to shorten a line exceeding 75 chars
- added 'additionalProperties: false'
- removed 'clock-names' from example node

-* ROHM BD71837 and BD71847 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings
-
-BD71837MWV and BD71847MWV are programmable Power Management ICs for powering
-single-core, dual-core, and quad-core SoCs such as NXP-i.MX 8M. They are
-optimized for low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. BD71837MWV
-integrates 8 Buck regulators and 7 LDOs. BD71847MWV contains 6 Buck regulators
-and 6 LDOs.
-
-Datasheet for BD71837 is available at:
-https://www.rohm.com/datasheet/BD71837MWV/bd71837mwv-e
-Datasheet for BD71847 is available at:
-https://www.rohm.com/datasheet/BD71847AMWV/bd71847amwv-e
-
-Required properties:
- - compatible		: Should be "rohm,bd71837" for bd71837
-				    "rohm,bd71847" for bd71847.
- - reg			: I2C slave address.
- - interrupt-parent	: Phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
- - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
- - clocks		: The parent clock connected to PMIC. If this is missing
-			  32768 KHz clock is assumed.
- - #clock-cells		: Should be 0.
- - regulators:		: List of child nodes that specify the regulators.
-			  Please see ../regulator/rohm,bd71837-regulator.txt
-
-Optional properties:
-- clock-output-names	: Should contain name for output clock.
-- rohm,reset-snvs-powered : Transfer BD718x7 to SNVS state at reset.
-
-The BD718x7 supports two different HW states as reset target states. States
-are called as SNVS and READY. At READY state all the PMIC power outputs go
-down and OTP is reload. At the SNVS state all other logic and external
-devices apart from the SNVS power domain are shut off. Please refer to NXP
-i.MX8 documentation for further information regarding SNVS state. When a
-reset is done via SNVS state the PMIC OTP data is not reload. This causes
-power outputs that have been under SW control to stay down when reset has
-switched power state to SNVS. If reset is done via READY state the power
-outputs will be returned to HW control by OTP loading. Thus the reset
-target state is set to READY by default. If SNVS state is used the boot
-crucial regulators must have the regulator-always-on and regulator-boot-on
-properties set in regulator node.
-
-- rohm,short-press-ms	: Short press duration in milliseconds
-- rohm,long-press-ms	: Long press duration in milliseconds
-
-Configure the "short press" and "long press" timers for the power button.
-Values are rounded to what hardware supports (500ms multiple for short and
-1000ms multiple for long). If these properties are not present the existing
-configuration (from bootloader or OTP) is not touched.
-
-Example:
-
-	/* external oscillator node */
-	osc: oscillator {
-		compatible = "fixed-clock";
-		#clock-cells = <1>;
-		clock-frequency  = <32768>;
-		clock-output-names = "osc";
-	};
-
-	pmic: pmic@4b {
-		compatible = "rohm,bd71837";
-		reg = <0x4b>;
-		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
-		interrupts = <29 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
-		interrupt-names = "irq";
-		#clock-cells = <0>;
-		clocks = <&osc 0>;
-		clock-output-names = "bd71837-32k-out";
-		rohm,reset-snvs-powered;
-
-		regulators {
-			buck1: BUCK1 {
-				regulator-name = "buck1";
-				regulator-min-microvolt = <700000>;
-				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
-				regulator-boot-on;
-				regulator-always-on;
-				regulator-ramp-delay = <1250>;
-			};
-			// [...]
-		};

-		compatible = "company,my-rtc";
-		clock-names = "my-clock";
-		clocks = <&pmic>;

+description: |
+  BD71847AMWV and BD71850MWV are programmable Power Management ICs for powering
+  single-core,  dual-core, and quad-core SoCs such as NXP-i.MX 8M. It is
+  optimized for low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. BD71847MWV and
+  BD71850MWV integrate 6 Buck regulators and 6 LDOs.

+# The BD71847 abd BD71850 support two different HW states as reset target

+# and external devices apart from the SNVS power domain are shut off. Please
+# refer to NXP i.MX8 documentation for further information regarding SNVS
+# state. When a reset is done via SNVS state the PMIC OTP data is not reload.
+# This causes power outputs that have been under SW control to stay down when
+# reset has switched power state to SNVS. If reset is done via READY state the
+# power outputs will be returned to HW control by OTP loading. Thus the reset
+# target state is set to READY by default. If SNVS state is used the boot

-ROHM BD71837 and BD71847 Power Management Integrated Circuit regulator bindings

-Required properties:
- - regulator-name: should be "buck1", ..., "buck8" and "ldo1", ..., "ldo7" for
-                   BD71837. For BD71847 names should be "buck1", ..., "buck6"
-		   and "ldo1", ..., "ldo6"
-
-List of regulators provided by this controller. BD71837 regulators node
-should be sub node of the BD71837 MFD node. See BD71837 MFD bindings at
-Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd71837-pmic.txt
-Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>. The
-definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
-binding for regulators at
-Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
-Note that if BD71837 starts at RUN state you probably want to use
-regulator-boot-on at least for BUCK6 and BUCK7 so that those are not
-disabled by driver at startup. LDO5 and LDO6 are supplied by those and
-if they are disabled at startup the voltage monitoring for LDO5/LDO6 will
-cause PMIC to reset.
-
-The valid names for BD71837 regulator nodes are:
-BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, BUCK5, BUCK6, BUCK7, BUCK8
-LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6, LDO7
-
-The valid names for BD71847 regulator nodes are:
-BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, BUCK5, BUCK6
-LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6
-
-Optional properties:
-- rohm,dvs-run-voltage		: PMIC default "RUN" state voltage in uV.
-				  See below table for bucks which support this.
-- rohm,dvs-idle-voltage		: PMIC default "IDLE" state voltage in uV.
-				  See below table for bucks which support this.
-- rohm,dvs-suspend-voltage	: PMIC default "SUSPEND" state voltage in uV.

+description: |
+  List of regulators provided by this controller. BD71847 regulators node
+  should be sub node of the BD71847 MFD node. See BD71847 MFD bindings at
+  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd71847-pmic.yaml
+  Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>. The
+  definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
+  binding for regulators at
+  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
+  Note that if BD71847 starts at RUN state you probably want to use
+  regulator-boot-on at least for BUCK5. LDO6 is supplied by it and it must
+  not be disabled by driver at startup. If BUCK5 is disabled at startup the
+  voltage monitoring for LDO5/LDO6 can cause PMIC to reset.
+
+#The valid names for BD71847 regulator nodes are:
+#BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, BUCK5, BUCK6
+#LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6
