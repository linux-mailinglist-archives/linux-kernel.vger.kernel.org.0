Sorry that We may miss it completely, we shall double check it and
make the proper patch carefully.

I have checked it again, @es_stats_cache_hits and @es_stats_cache_miesses
have been initialized before the journal inode is loaded, Maybe I miss
something else?

egrep "ext4_es_register_shrinker|ext4_load_journal" fs/ext4/super.c
4260:   if (ext4_es_register_shrinker(sbi))
4302:           err = ext4_load_journal(sb, es, journal_devnum);

Thanks,
Shaokun
