Hello Andrew,

I was able to apply the above mentioned V3 series [1] from David with some changes
listed below which tests positively on arm64. These changes assume that the arm64
hot-remove series (current V5) gets applied first.

Changes to David's series

A) Please drop (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10962565/) [v3,04/11]

	- arch_remove_memory() is already being added through hot-remove series

B) Rebase (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10962575/) [v3, 06/11]

	- arm64 hot-remove series adds CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE wrapper around
	  arch_remove_memory() which can be dropped in the rebased patch

C) Rebase (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10962589/) [v3, 09/11]

	- hot-remove series moves arch_remove_memory() before memblock_[free|remove]()
	- So remove_memory_block_devices() should be moved before arch_remove_memory()
	  in it's new position

David,

Please do let me know if the plan sounds good or you have some other suggestions.
