It's most likely not a recent regression, but it has unfortunate effects
on the affinity mask which directly affects my ongoing work on the
pin_on_cpu() system call [1].

The sched_setaffinity vs cpu hotplug semantic provided by CONFIG_CPUSET=n
if fine for the needs on pin_on_cpu(): when a CPU comes back online,
those reappear in the affinity mask, but it is not the case with
CONFIG_CPUSET=y.

I wonder if applying the online cpu masks to the per-thread affinity mask
is the correct approach ? I suspect what we may be looking for here is to keep
the affinity mask independent of cpu hotplug, and look-up both the per-thread
affinity mask and the online cpu mask whenever the scheduler needs to perform
"is_cpu_allowed()" to check task placement.

Then whenever sched_getaffinity or cpusets try to query the current set of
cpus on which a task can run right now, it could also look at both the task's
affinity mask and the online cpu mask.

Thanks,

Mathieu
