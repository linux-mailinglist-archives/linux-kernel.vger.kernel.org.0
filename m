We discussed and tried many ways to copy the first 640K of 1st kernel
out since kernel data may be allocated there, then crash need it to
parse. But SME makes the copy very difficult to do, because the first
640K is encrypted in 1st kernel, but the copy is done in purgatory with
1:1 ident-mapping and unencrypted.

Finally we decided this way as patch does. Reserving it in memblock is
not ignoring the first 640K, but lock it down to avoid any later kernel
data allocated in this area. The first 640K will be taken as system RAM
of kdump kernel as is. Like this, no available kernel information
could be located in this area, then we don't care if the copy is correct
or not.

One word, what the patch is doing is locking down the first 640K after 
reserve_real_mode() invocation. Putting it after reserve_real_mode() is
because reserve_real_mode() may put real mode trampoline inside first
640K. Surely the real mode trampoline will be discarded too in kdump
kernel, since it's not important and unnecessary for crash parsing.

I think Lianbo need rewrite this patch log to make it clearer.
