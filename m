Subject: [PATCH] printk: Do not lose last line in kmsg dump
Date:   Tue,  9 Jul 2019 10:10:42 +0200

kmsg_dump_get_buffer() is supposed to select the youngest log messages
which fit into the provided buffer.  When that function determines the
correct start index, by looping and calling msg_print_text() with a NULL
buffer, msg_print_text() calculates a length which would allow the
youngest log messages to completely fill the provided buffer.

However, when doing the actual printing, an off-by-one error in
msg_print_text() leads to that function allowing the provided buffer to
only be filled to (size - 1).

So if the lengths of the selected youngest log messages happen to
precisely fill up the provided buffer, the last log message is not
included.

For example, with the following two final prints:

[    6.427502] AAAAAAAAAAAAA
[    6.427769] BBBBBBBB12345

A dump of a 64-byte buffer filled by kmsg_dump_get_buffer(), before this
patch:

 00000000: 3c 30 3e 5b 20 20 20 20 36 2e 35 32 32 31 39 37  <0>[    6.522197
 00000010: 5d 20 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 0a  ] AAAAAAAAAAAAA.
 00000020: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
 00000030: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................

After this patch:

 00000000: 3c 30 3e 5b 20 20 20 20 36 2e 34 32 37 35 30 32  <0>[    6.427502
 00000010: 5d 20 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 41 0a  ] AAAAAAAAAAAAA.
 00000020: 3c 30 3e 5b 20 20 20 20 36 2e 34 32 37 37 36 39  <0>[    6.427769
 00000030: 5d 20 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 42 31 32 33 34 35 0a  ] BBBBBBBB12345.

Note that this bug only affects the kmsg dump code.  msg_print_text() is
also used from the syslog code and console_unlock() but this bug does
trigger there since the buffers used there are never filled up
completely (since they are only used to print individual lines, and
their size is always LOG_LINE_MAX + PREFIX_MAX, and PREFIX_MAX has a
value which is larger than the largest possible prefix).
