That's very much appreciated! We decided to use that tool here to detect
regressions in James' upcoming resctrl rework series. While doing so we
spotted some shortcomings:
- There is some unconditional x86 inline assembly which obviously breaks
the build on ARM.
- The result output is somewhat confusing, I find it hard to see whether a
test succeeded or not, also it's not easily parseable by scripts.
- There are some basic tests missing (does the filesystem exist? Is the
mount point visible?)
- Some tests create files in the current directory. This is somewhat
confusing if you happen to be in some sysfs directory, for instance. I
don't think we really need temporary files (pipes should cover most of the
cases), but in case we do, we should create them in some /tmp directory,
probably by using a glibc function for this.
- There were some problems that newer GCC and clang complained about.

For now I didn't look too closely at the actual test algorithms, but
decided to fix those things first. I replied to some of the smaller issues
I spotted on the way in the individual patch mails.

For the bigger things (new tests, result formatting) I just went ahead and
fixed them in my own branch [1] (work in progress!). I went with TAP
formatting, because this is both readable by humans and can be processed
by the "prove" tool (or any other simple UNIX tool, for that matter).

I used this amended version to do some regression testing on James'
resctrl rework series, which involved boot testing more than 100 patches,
so automation is key here. The result looks like this:
===================
TAP version 13
ok kernel supports resctrl filesystem
ok resctrl mountpoint "/sys/fs/resctrl" exists
# resctrl filesystem not mounted
# Starting MBM BW change ...
ok MBM: bw change # SKIP memory bandwidth not supported
# Starting MBA Schemata Change ...
ok MBA: change-schemata # SKIP memory bandwidth not supported
# Starting CQM test ...
ok mounting resctrl to "/sys/fs/resctrl"
ok CQM: test # SKIP L3 not supported
# Starting CAT test ...
ok mounting resctrl to "/sys/fs/resctrl"
cache size :31457280
ok writing benchmark parameters to resctrl FS
ok Write schema "L3:0=7fff" to resctrl FS
ok cache difference more than 4 %
# Percent diff=16
# Number of bits: 15
# Avg_llc_perf_miss: 306994
# Allocated cache lines: 368640
ok CAT: test
1..11
=================

Appreciate any feedback on this!

Cheers,
Andre.
