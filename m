The generic PTDUMP is implemented as a library - so the architectures
would have to provide the call into ptdump_walk_pgd() and provide the
necessary callback note_page() which formats the lines in the output.

Hopefully the implementation is generic enough that it should be
flexible enough to work for most architectures.

arm, powerpc and s390 are the obvious architectures to convert next as
they already have note_page() functions which shouldn't be too difficult
to convert to match the callback prototype.

There isn't any problem as such with using p?d_large macros. However the
name "large" has caused confusion in the past. In particular there are
two types of "large" page:

1. leaf entries at high levels than normal ('sections' on Arm, for 4K
pages this gives you 2MB and 1GB pages).

2. sets of contiguous entries that can share a TLB entry (the
'Contiguous bit' on Arm - which for 4K pages gives you 16 entries = 64
KB 'pages').

In many cases both give the same effect (reduce pressure on TLBs and
requires contiguous and aligned physical addresses). But for this case
we only care about the 'leaf' case (because the contiguous bit makes no
difference to walking the page tables).

As far as I'm aware p?d_large() currently implements the first and
p?d_(trans_)huge() implements either 1 or 2 depending on the architecture.

Will[1] suggested the same p?d_leaf() and this also avoids stepping on
the existing usage of p?d_large() which isn't always available on every
architecture.

x86 currently outputs a line for every range, including those which are
unpopulated. Patch 14 removes those lines from the output, only showing
the populated ranges. This was discussed[2] previously.

Yes, that was always where I was heading. But I initially thought it
would be easier to get the generic walking code in, followed by
implementing generic PTDUMP. But it turns out the generic PTDUMP is
actually the easy bit :)
