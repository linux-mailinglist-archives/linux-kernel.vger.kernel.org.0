No changes here.  My bad, I probably should have written this:

as
Cypress’ Solution = Wi-Fi Firmware + regional regulatory database (CLM) + RF settings (NVRAM).

The idea/architecture here is to allow for these software parts to change
independently. So yes, users can change nvram (or CLM or the firmware itself)
and still use the overall solution.

Hans
