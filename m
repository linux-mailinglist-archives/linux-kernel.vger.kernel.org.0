Ugh, I see, this is an "EPT Misconfiguration".  Oh, well.  I guess
just keep things as they are and document things better, please.
Don't try to emulate.

I don't suppose Intel could be convinced to get rid of that in a
future CPU and allow write-only memory?

BTW, is your patch checking for support in IA32_VMX_EPT_VPID_CAP?  I
didn't notice it, but I didn't look that hard.
