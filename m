Ok, that makes sense to me. I'd suggest something like:

| The graph tracer hooks returns by modifying frame records on the
| (regular) stack, but with SCS the return address is taken from the
| shadow stack, and the value in the frame record has no effect. As we
| don't currently have a mechanism to determine the corresponding slot
| on the shadow stack (and to pass this through the ftrace
| infrastructure), for now let's disable the graph tracer when SCS is
| enabled.

... as I suspect with some rework of the trampoline and common ftrace
code we'd be able to correctly manipulate the shadow stack for this.
Similarly, if clang gained -fpatchable-funciton-etnry, we'd get that for
free.

Thanks,
Mark.
