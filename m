Unless I misunderstand what you are saying this all is just expected.
You have restricted the memory explicitly and the result is that not all
the memory is visible.

This is a simple statement without any actual explanation on why. Why is
hotplug memory special? What is the usecase? Who would want to use mem
parameter and later expect a memory above the restrected area to be
hotplugable?

David has provided an actual usecase [1] but this needs to be documented
somewhere so that we do not break that accidentally in the future.
Ideally both in code which adds the boot restriction and the kernel
command line documentation to be explicit about BOOT restriction.
