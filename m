No, I mean is there or will there be only one version of this?

Yes, that's more aligned with IIO ADC bindings. Yes, IIO is again a
Linuxism, but I think the ADC bindings are fairly independent other
than the directory name.

Seems somewhat better location in that the first level is
sub-functions of this chip.

But now you have 'adc' with no address and 'fan' (w/ reg should be
fan@...) with an address, so that's not consistent.

Also, I think fan controllers and fans need to have separate nodes as
there are different types of fans such as with and without tach
signals. I've tried to steer other fan bindings that way. Depends how
complex the fan controller is whether that's necessary.

Don't use 'type'.

Is this for 'how to setup/program the adc' or 'what am I measuring'?
For example, configure the adc for temperature readings vs. measure
CPU temperature. Seems like a common thing needed for ADC. 'label'
already covers the latter case.

Yes, drop the '$ref'.
