This [1] is a fairly old thread, but I only recently stumbled upon it,
while co-investigating below audio distortions [2] on R-Car3 ARM64
boards, which can be reproduced by stressing [3] the serial console.

The investigation started a few months ago, when users reported
audio drops during the first seconds of system startup. Only after
a few weeks it became clear (thanks to some people in Cc) that the
distortions were contributed by the above-average serial console load
during the early boot. Once understood, we were able to come up with
a synthetic test [2-3].

I thought it would be interesting to share below reproduction matrix,
in order to contrast vanilla to linux-rt-devel [4], as well as to
compare various preemption models.
 
                           | Ser.console  Ser.console
                           | stressed     at rest or disabled
      --------------------------------------------
      v5.5-rc6 (PREEMPT=y) | distorted    clean
    v5.4.5-rt3 (PREEMPT=y) | distorted    clean
 v5.4.5-rt3 (PREEMPT_RT=y) | clean        clean

My feeling is that the results probably do not surprise linux-rt people.

My first question is, should there be any improvement in the case of
v5.4.5-rt3 (PREEMPT=y), which I do not sense? I would expect so, based
on the cover letter of this series (pointing out the advantages of the
redesigned printk mechanism).

And the other question is, how would you, generally speaking, tackle
the problem, given that backporting the linux-rt patches is *not* an
option and enabling serial console is a must?
