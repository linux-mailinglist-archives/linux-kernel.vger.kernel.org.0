Thanks for the info:)
X86 systems roughly have NCPU * 200 vectors available for device interrupts.
The proposed patch tries to map multiple event sources to an interrupt vector, to avoid running out of x86 CPU vectors.
Many virtio mmio devices may have several or tens of event sources, and it’s rare to have hundreds of event sources.
So could we treat the dynamic mapping between event sources and interrupt vectors as an advanced optional feature?
